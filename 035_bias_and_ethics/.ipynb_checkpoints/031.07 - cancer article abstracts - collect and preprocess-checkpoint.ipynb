      "This paper reviews the Twenty-fourth Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The preliminary results of the ATAC study have shown that Arimidex is superior to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ER-positive early breast cancer in terms of DFS, adverse effects and prevention of contralateral breast cancer. However, longer follow up is required to assess the drug safety regarding bone mineral density and cognitive function. Letrozole seems to be superior to tamoxifen as a first-line therapy in ER-positive advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Although the incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia is significantly increased (cumulative incidence at 5 years = 1.1%) in breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide and anthracyclines, the risk of this complication is easily outweighed by the benefits of chemotherapy. Adjuvant clodronate was found to be associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of bone metastases during the treatment period. A randomised trial comparing axillary dissection and axillary radiotherapy (RT) for early breast cancer reported no significant difference in survival at 15 years. However, axillary recurrence was significantly increased in the RT group. hTERT protein expression by IHC was found to correlate significantly with breast cancer-specific survival. There is no evidence to support the use of IHC of the sentinel node in routine clinical practice. LCIS is currently considered as a non-obligate precursor to breast cancer rather than just a risk factor.\n"

      "Breast cancer histologies show important differences in their incidence pattern, method of detection and management. Aggregation of breast cancer occurs also in families diagnosed for cancer at sites different from the breast. Therefore, the familial association of histology specific breast cancers with cancers at other sites is of great interest. The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to calculate standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for breast cancer when parents or sibling were diagnosed with cancer at the most common sites. Significant SIRs were found when parents had breast, ovarian, laryngeal, endometrial, prostate, lung and colon cancers. If women were diagnosed before the age of 50 years, the SIRs were significant when parents were diagnosed with breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers, and leukaemia, and when siblings were diagnosed with squamous cell skin, pancreatic, breast and endometrial cancers. If mothers were diagnosed with breast cancer, histology-specific SIRs were ranked as comedo > tubular > ductal > lobular; SIR for medullary carcinoma was not significant but it was high when mothers presented with ovarian cancer. Other associations were between the upper aerodigestive tract and lobular, colon and comedo, larynx and ductal cancer. Moreover, cervical cancer was associated with comedo and endometrial cancer with the medullary histology. In conclusion, histology-specific breast cancers were associated with specific cancer sites and the strength of the association varied among histologies.\n",
      "Acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) occurs with increased frequency in women with previously diagnosed breast cancer. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy are related to this increase. We studied the interrelationships among age at breast cancer diagnosis, interval to ANLL diagnosis, and survival in 54 women of whom 11 were from Kansas and 43 were from two other published series. Median age at breast cancer diagnosis was 50.5 years, median interval to ANLL diagnosis was 4.8 years, and median survival after ANLL diagnosis was 2.2 months. Increasing age was associated with a decrease of the interval to ANLL diagnosis just short of statistical significance (P = 0.0591). There was no association of survival with either age or the interval to ANLL diagnosis. With an increase in the use of adjuvant therapy in breast cancer there is a need to identify women at greatest risk of subsequently developing ANLL, at present not possible.\n"

      "Breast cancer survivors have increased risks of developing second primary cancers due to shared etiology, life style factors but also to primary breast cancer treatment. Among 53 418 patients registered by the population based Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) during 1977-2001, 31 818 patients were treated and followed according to guidelines of DBCG. In addition to surgery 23% received tamoxifen, 23% chemotherapy and 35% radiotherapy as treatment for primary breast cancer. Second primary cancers were identified by linkage to the population based Danish Cancer Register. Cancer incidence rates of the Danish population were used for calculation of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Time at risk was from diagnosis of breast cancer+1 year until death or through 2002. Risk for all second primary cancers combined was increased, SIR=1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.99-1.08). Sites with significantly elevated risks included corpus uteri (SIR=1.23), ovary (1.39), soft tissues (2.24), acute leukaemia (2.02), and sites potentially inducible by breast cancer radiotherapy combined (1.11). For irradiated patients compared to non-irradiated the risk was increased for all sited combined, radiotherapy-related sites, colon and soft tissues. Tamoxifen treated had, compared to non-treated, elevated risk for cancer of corpus uteri (SIR=1.83 vs 1.04). Patients given adjuvant chemotherapy had, compared to those not, elevated risks for all sites combined (SIR=1.24 vs 1.01) and for ovary (2.16 vs 1.24). Risk for cancer of the lung, uterus and ovary was analysed using multivariate Poisson regression. For lung cancer the risk was related to radiotherapy and time since diagnosis, the relative risk for lung cancer being 1.33 (95% CI 1.00-1.77) (irradiated vs non-irradiated). Ovary cancer risk was inversely related to age at diagnosis but not to treatment and corpus uteri cancer risk related to tamoxifen treatment, relative risk 1.57. The findings are in accordance to other population based studies.\n"

      "OBJECTIVE: To update a study of risks for leukaemia, brain cancer and breast cancer in a Danish nationwide, population-based cohort of utility employees. METHODS: A multivariate statistical model including information on age, duration of employment, date of first employment and level of occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields was applied. RESULTS: No increased risk for these cancers was seen among 28,224 subjects with more than 3 months of employment in whom cancer had not been diagnosed before first employment. CONCLUSION: The results do not support the hypothesis of an association between occupational exposure to magnetic fields in the electric utility industry and risks for leukaemia, brain cancer and breast cancer.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia among the adults in the Western World. CLL (and the corresponding nodal entity small lymphocytic lymphoma, SLL) is classified as a lymphoproliferative disorder characterised by the relentless accumulation of mature B-lymphocytes showing a peculiar immunophenotype in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. CLL clinical course is very heterogeneous: the majority of patients follow an indolent clinical course with no or delayed treatment need and with a prolonged survival, while others experience aggressive disease requiring early treatment followed by frequent relapses. In the last decade, the improved understanding of CLL pathogenesis shed light on premalignant conditions (i.e., monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, MBL), defined new prognostic and predictive markers, improving patient stratification, but also broadened the therapeutic armamentarium with novel agents, targeting fundamental signaling pathways.\n",
      "Neonatal leukaemia is defined as occurring within the first 28 days of life and most, if not all, cases are congenital. With the exception of Down syndrome-associated transient abnormal myelopoiesis, which is not considered here, neonatal leukaemias are rare. In two-thirds of patients the disease manifests as an acute myeloid leukaemia, frequently with monocytic/monoblastic characteristics. Most other cases are acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, particularly B lineage, but some are mixed phenotype or blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms. The most frequently observed cytogenetic/molecular abnormality is t(4;11)(q21.3;q23.3)/KMT2A-AFF1 followed by t(1;22)(p13.3;q13.1)/RBM15-MKL1 and t(8;16)(p11.2;p13.3)/KAT6A-CREBBP. Common clinical features include prominent hepatosplenomegaly and a high incidence of skin involvement, sometimes in the absence of bone marrow disease. A distinctive feature is the occurrence of spontaneous remission in some cases, particularly in association with t(8;16). In this review, we summarise current knowledge of the clinical, cytogenetic and molecular features of neonatal leukaemia and discuss clinical management of these cases.\n",
      "Prolymphocytic leukaemias B-PLL and T-PLL are rare disorders, typically with an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. Combining morphology, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic and molecular diagnostics reliably separates B-PLL and T-PLL from one another and other disorders. In T-PLL discovery of frequent mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway have increased understanding of disease pathogenesis. Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) produces excellent response rates but long-term remissions are only achieved in a minority following consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplant. Molecular abnormalities in B-PLL are less understood. Disruption of TP53 is a key finding, conveying chemotherapy resistance requiring novel therapies such as B-cell receptor inhibitors (BCRi). Both conditions require improved pathobiological knowledge to identify new treatment targets and guide therapy with novel pathway inhibitors.\n",
      "The field of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnostics, initially based solely on morphological assessment, has integrated more and more disciplines. Today, state-of-the-art AML diagnostics relies on cytomorphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and molecular genetics. Only the integration of all of these methods allows for a comprehensive and complementary characterisation of each case, which is prerequisite for optimal AML diagnosis and management. Here, we will review why multidisciplinary diagnostics is mandatory today and will gain even more importance in the future, especially in the context of precision medicine. We will discuss ideas and strategies that are likely to shape and improve multidisciplinary diagnostics in AML and may even overcome some of today gold standards. This includes recent technical advances that provide genome-wide molecular insights. The enormous amount of data obtained by these latter techniques represents a great challenge, but also a unique chance. We will reflect on how this increase in knowledge can be incorporated into the routine to pave the way for personalised medicine in AML.\n",
      "Conflict of interest statement: TH is part owner and founder of the MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory. IS is employed by the MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory. The MLL offers diagnostic services for leukaemias and lymphomas, including cytomorphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, FISH, and a broad spectrum of molecular assays. In addition, MLL runs several research studies based on a combination of methods for routine use and also including whole genome sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing.\n",
      "In contrast to solid cancers, which often require genetic modifications and complex cellular reprogramming for effective metastatic dissemination, leukaemic cells uniquely possess the innate ability for migration and invasion. Dedifferentiated, malignant leukocytes retain the benign leukocytes' capacity for cell motility and survival in the circulation, while acquiring the potential for rapid and uncontrolled cell division. For these reasons, leukaemias, although not traditionally considered as metastatic diseases, are in fact models of highly efficient metastatic spread. Accordingly, they are often aggressive and challenging diseases to treat. In this Perspective, we discuss the key molecular processes that facilitate metastasis in a variety of leukaemic subtypes, the clinical significance of leukaemic invasion into specific tissues and the current pipeline of treatments targeting leukaemia metastasis.\n",
      "Leukaemias and other cancers possess a rare population of cells capable of the limitless self-renewal necessary for cancer initiation and maintenance. Eradication of these cancer stem cells is probably a critical part of any successful anti-cancer therapy, and may explain why conventional cancer therapies are often effective in reducing tumour burden, but are only rarely curative. Given that both normal and cancer stem cells are capable of self-renewal, the extent to which cancer stem cells resemble normal tissue stem cells is a critical issue if targeted therapies are to be developed. However, it remains unclear whether cancer stem cells must be phenotypically similar to normal tissue stem cells or whether they can retain the identity of committed progenitors. Here we show that leukaemia stem cells (LSC) can maintain the global identity of the progenitor from which they arose while activating a limited stem-cell- or self-renewal-associated programme. We isolated LSC from leukaemias initiated in committed granulocyte macrophage progenitors through introduction of the MLL-AF9 fusion protein encoded by the t(9;11)(p22;q23). The LSC were capable of transferring leukaemia to secondary recipient mice when only four cells were transferred, and possessed an immunophenotype and global gene expression profile very similar to that of normal granulocyte macrophage progenitors. However, a subset of genes highly expressed in normal haematopoietic stem cells was re-activated in LSC. LSC can thus be generated from committed progenitors without widespread reprogramming of gene expression, and a leukaemia self-renewal-associated signature is activated in the process. Our findings define progression from normal progenitor to cancer stem cell, and suggest that targeting a self-renewal programme expressed in an abnormal context may be possible.\n",
      "In summary, the management of women diagnosed with leukaemia in pregnancy needs an interdisciplinary approach, including a careful oncological work-up as well as close monitoring of the pregnancy until delivery and beyond. Patients with acute leukaemias normally must receive anti-leukaemic treatment at full dosage prior to delivery, except for selected women diagnosed very close to term. Treatment should be avoided in the first trimester. The prognosis of pregnant women with acute leukaemia corresponds to that of an age-matched and diagnosis-matched non-pregnant cohort of patients, provided appropriate treatment is given. If given as of the second trimester, the typical chemotherapy regimes used for acute leukaemias imply acceptable acute toxicities to the fetus, with a somewhat increased risk of premature birth or developmental retardation, but no clear evidence of late sequelae in children and adolescents who were exposed to cytostatic agents whilst in utero. In chronic leukaemias and MDS, treatment may often be delayed until after delivery. In CML targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate is safe as of the second trimester, and possibly even before. Obstetric care and monitoring of women with leukaemia are essential throughout the pregnancy to ensure the best possible outcome for mother and child.\n",
      "The acute leukaemias account for about 30% of all malignancy seen in childhood across the Western world. A peak incidence of precursor B cell ALL has emerged as socio-economic conditions have improved in countries worldwide. From twin studies and the use of neonatal blood spots it has been possible to back track the first initiating genetic events within critical haemopoietic cells to foetal development in utero for most precursor B cell ALL and some cases of AML. These events may occur as part of normal foetal development. Whether other factors (environmental or constitutional) are involved to increase the chance of these first genetic changes happening is unclear. For some leukaemias (e.g. infant MLL positive ALL) the first event appears adequate to create a malignant clone but for the majority of ALL and AML further 'genetic' changes are required, probably postnatal. Many environmental factors have been proposed as causative for leukaemia but only ionising irradiation and certain chemicals, e.g. benzene and cytotoxics (alkylators and topoisomerase II inhibitors) have been confirmed and then principally for acute myeloid leukaemia. It appears increasingly likely that delayed, dysregulated responses to 'common' infectious agents play a major part in the conversion of pre-leukaemic clones into overt precursor B cell ALL, the most common form of childhood leukaemia. Constitutional polymorphic alleleic variants in immune response genes (especially the HLA Class II proteins) and cytokines may play a role in determining the type of immune response. High penetrance germ-line mutations are involved in only about 5% of childhood leukaemias (more in AML than ALL). There is little evidence to support any role of viral transformation in causation, unlike in animals. Other environmental factors for which some evidence exists include non-ionising electromagnetic radiation and electric fields, although their mode of action in leukaemogenesis remains unclear. There is no single cause for childhood leukaemia and for most individuals a combination of factors appears to be necessary; all involving gene-environment interactions. To date few clear preventative measures have emerged, except the complete avoidance of first trimester X-rays in pregnancy; a healthy diet with adequate oral folic acid intake both preconception and early in pregnancy; and the early exposure of children to other children outside the home to facilitate stimulation and maturation of the natural immune system. Here then are clear echoes of the \"hygiene hypothesis\" regarding the initiation of allergies, autoimmune disease and type I diabetes mellitus in children and young people.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Determine if therapy of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a model for treating other cancers. RECENT FINDINGS: CML has a relatively homogeneous phenotype and genotype and is caused by one mutation, BCRABL1, in every instance. In contrast, most other leukaemias, haematologic cancers and solid cancer have more heterogeneous phenotypes and extraordinarily greater genotypic diversity and mutational complexity. Lesions learned from treating CML have little applicability to other leukaemias, haematologic cancers or solid cancer.\n",
      "The leukaemias are a heterogeneous group of blood cancers, which together, caused 310,000 deaths in 2016. Despite significant research into their biology and therapeutics, leukaemia is predicted to account for an increased 470,000 deaths in 2040. Many subtypes remain without targeted therapy, and therefore the mainstay of treatment remains generic cytotoxic drugs with bone marrow transplant the sole definitive option. In this review, we will focus on cellular mechanisms which have the potential for therapeutic exploitation to specifically target and treat this devastating disease. We will bring together the disciplines of autophagy and extracellular vesicles, exploring how the dysregulation of these mechanisms can lead to changes in the leukaemic microenvironment and the subsequent propagation of disease. The dual effect of these mechanisms in the disease microenvironment is not limited to leukaemia; therefore, we briefly explore their role in autoimmunity, inflammation and degenerative disease.\n",
      "Acute leukaemias are a group of malignancies characterised by the invasion of the bone marrow by immature haematopoietic precursors and differentiation arrest at various maturation steps. Multiplicity of intrinsic and extrinsic factors influences the transformation and progression of leukaemia. The intrinsic factors encompass genetic alterations of cellular pathways leading to the activation of, among others, inflammatory pathways (such as nuclear factor kappa B). The extrinsic components include, among others, the inflammatory pathways activated by the bone marrow microenvironment and include chemokines, cytokines and adhesion molecules. In this chapter, we review the role of inflammatory processes in the transformation, survival and proliferation of leukaemias, particularly the role of nuclear factor kappa B and its downstream signalling in leukaemias and the novel therapeutic strategies that exploit potentially unique properties of inflammatory signalling that offer interesting options for future therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "The history of the epidemiology of leukaemia provides us with models which are very useful even today and their implications for the future are still more important. Thus, in the present study, we shall review the history and present state of the epidemiology of leukaemia, as well as its future prospects. In the fifth century B.C. Hippocrates already advocated studying the climatic, geographical and physical environment as well as the behaviour of individuals and of their eating and drinking habits in order to understand the origin of a disease. At present, the epidemiology of leukaemia is still based on these ancient precepts.\n",
      "Acute leukaemias are characterized by recurring chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations that are crucial to disease pathogenesis. It is now evident that epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, substantially contribute to the phenotype of leukaemia cells. An additional layer of epigenetic complexity is the pathogenetic role of microRNAs in leukaemias, and their key role in the transcriptional regulation of tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes. The genetic heterogeneity of acute leukaemias poses therapeutic challenges, but pharmacological agents that target components of the epigenetic machinery are promising as a component of the therapeutic arsenal for this group of diseases.\n",
      "Using synthetic peptide or recombinant protein as immunising antigens we have produced monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera directed against targets of particular interest in leukaemia diagnosis. In this way we have prepared reagents which recognise all T or all B lymphocytes in routinely fixed paraffin sections which are unique in this respect. We have also produced monoclonal antibodies to molecules potentially involved in specific neoplastic transformations, implicated by virtue of the involvement of their genes in chromosomal defects in these neoplasms. In particular, we have produced antibodies recognising bcl-2, involved in follicular lymphoma, tal-1, involved in T-cell acute leukaemias and HRX involved in a variety of hematologic disorders. The application of these reagents to diagnosis has so far proved useful. In addition their use outside the field of leukaemia diagnosis has proved to be even more important in some cases.\n",
      "Childhood myeloid leukaemias are a diverse collection of conditions. Although many are also seen in adults, some are peculiar to childhood. In childhood AML, as in adults, cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with specific clinical features and define prognostic groups. In infants under 1 year with AML, the incidence of 11q23 abnormalities is particularly high. The finding of identical 11q23 breakpoints in infant leukaemia as in therapy-related leukaemias suggests a role for in utero exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors. There are a number of constitutional disorders that predispose children to develop AML, usually with a preceding myelodysplastic phase. Monosomy (or deletion of the long arm) of chromosome 7 is the most frequent chromosome abnormality in the bone marrow of such patients. Abnormalities of chromosome 7 are also common cytogenetic findings in all morphological subgroups of childhood myelodysplasia, either as a primary abnormality or associated with disease progression.\n",
      "Ionising radiation, in high dose and with acute exposure, is a factor that has been implicated in leukaemogenesis, but what is the evidence for leukaemogenesis and exposure to diagnostic X-rays, to natural terrestrial or cosmic ionising radiation, to electromagnetic fields, or to nuclear energy? Why is population mixing and infection a possible explanation for the clusters of childhood acute leukaemias around the nuclear processing plants of Sellafield and Dounreay? These questions, as well as how chemical agents, including therapeutic substances, might contribute to leukaemogenesis, are discussed in this last article in the leukaemia series.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a blood cancer characterized by acquired genetic mutations. There is great interest in accurately establishing measurable residual disease (MRD) burden in AML patients in remission after treatment but at risk of relapse. However, inter- and intrapatient genetic diversity means that, unlike in the chronic myeloid and acute promyelocytic leukaemias, no single genetic abnormality is pathognomonic for all cases of AML MRD. Next-generation sequencing offers the opportunity to test broadly and deeply for potential genetic evidence of residual AML, and while not currently accepted for such use clinically, is likely to be increasingly used for AML MRD testing in the future.\n",
      "Leukaemia in neonates (infants <1 month) is rare, whereby neonatal acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is more frequent than neonatal acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). High mortality rates are observed, though AML has a better prognosis than ALL. Neonatal leukaemia is typically presented with hepatosplenomegaly, leukaemia cutis and/or hyperleucocytosis. Congenital infections should be ruled out before diagnosis. Rearrangement of the MLL gene is the most frequently occurring genetic aberration. Treatment includes intensive multi-agent chemotherapy, usually with age-related dose adjustments next to supportive care. Treatment intensification for ALL could be indicated in the future as the dismal prognosis is subject to high relapse rates in ALL.\n",
      "In recent years immunophenotyping and analysis of clonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell antigen receptor genes have proved valuable for the diagnosis and classification of leukaemia. These techniques aid in the assignment of cell lineage in cases of acute leukaemia in which the standard FAB criteria of morphology and cytochemistry do not reveal clear lymphoid or myeloid phenotype. These new techniques have also revealed that the leukaemic blasts in a sizable minority of otherwise typical cases of acute leukaemia express 'inappropriate' lineage-associated markers and have been termed mixed acute leukaemias. The spectrum of characteristics encompassed by mixed acute leukaemias ranges from fairly common cases expressing one or two inappropriate markers to the more extreme, rare cases of acute leukaemia termed 'hybrid' in which a truly scrambled picture is seen. A subgroup of these mixed cases have two distinct populations of blasts, e.g. one lymphoid and the other myeloid. These observations raise a number of issues about the cell of origin of these leukaemias and about the mechanisms controlling the developmental regulation of expression of different lineage-associated markers. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that inappropriate expression of markers may identify sub-groups of both acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukaemia with an inferior prognosis.\n",
      "The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia and related neoplasms in adults is challenging as this requires the integration of clinical findings, morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and molecular genetic findings. Lack of familiarity with rare subtypes of acute leukaemia hinders the diagnosis. In this review, we will describe diagnostic findings of several rare acute myeloid leukaemias and related neoplasms that primarily occur in adults including information on presentation, morphology, immunophenotype, genetics, differential diagnosis, and prognosis. Leukaemias discussed include blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, acute myeloid leukaemia with t(6;9) (p23;q34.1); DEK-NUP214, acute myeloid leukaemia with inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21.3;q26.2); GATA2, MECOM, acute myeloid leukaemia with BCR-ABL1, acute leukaemias of ambiguous lineage, acute myeloid leukaemia with mutated RUNX1, pure erythroid leukaemia, acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis, and acute basophilic leukaemia. Case studies with morphological features of the nine subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia and related neoplasms have been included, and additional evidence available since publication of the 2016 World Health Organization Classification has been added to each subtype.\n",
      "Acute leukaemias are relatively common malignancies. Treatment has advanced significantly in the recent past and there has been improved patient survival. This improved initial response is leading to an increasing number of cases of relapse. Extramedullary relapse occurs in a wide variety of locations with varying presentations, imaging findings and differentials. The pathophysiology and clinical course of recurrent extramedullary myeloid and lymphocytic leukaemias are reviewed in this article. The wide variety of imaging findings associated with many important sites of recurrence and the associated differential diagnosis are discussed and illustrated.\n",
      "The relative genetic simplicity of leukaemias, the development of which likely relies on a limited number of initiating events has made them ideal for disease modelling, particularly in the mouse. Animal models provide incomparable insights into the mechanisms of leukaemia development and allow exploration of the molecular pillars of disease maintenance, an aspect often biased in cell lines or ex vivo systems. Several of these models, which faithfully recapitulate the characteristics of the human disease, have been used for pre-clinical purposes and have been instrumental in predicting therapy response in patients. We plea for a wider use of genetically defined animal models in the design of clinical trials, with a particular focus on reassessment of existing cancer or non-cancer drugs, alone or in combination.\n",
      "Proteomics technologies are emerging as a useful tool in the identification of disease biomarkers, and in defining and characterising both normal physiological and disease processes. Many cellular changes in protein expression in response to an external stimulus or mutation can only be characterised at the proteome level. In these cases protein expression is often controlled by altered rates of translation and/or degradation, making proteomics an important tool in the analysis of biological systems. In the leukaemias, post-translational modification of proteins (e.g. phosphorylation, acetylation) plays a key role in the molecular pathology of the disease: such modifications can now be detected with novel proteomic methods. In a clinical setting, serum remains a relatively un-mined source of information for prognosis and response to therapy. This protein rich fluid represents an opportunity for proteomics research to benefit hematologists and others. In this review, we discuss the technologies available for the study of the proteome that offer realistic opportunities in haematology.\n",
      "Increasing evidence suggests that leukaemias are sustained by leukaemic stem cells. Leukaemia can indeed be viewed as aberrant haematopoietic processes initiated by rare leukaemic stem cells that have maintained or re-acquired the capacity for indefinite proliferation through accumulated mutations and/or epigenetic changes. Yet, despite their critical importance, much remains to be learned about the developmental origin of leukaemic stem cells and the molecular pathways underlying the transformation of normal cells into leukaemic stem cells. This report will review our current knowledge on leukaemic stem cells development and finally demonstrate how these discoveries provide a paradigm for identification of cancer stem cells from solid tumours.\n",
      "Nearly all cancers are linked by the inexorable phenotype of metastasis as malignant growths have the capability to spread from their place of origin to distant sites throughout the body. While different cancers may have various propensities to migrate towards specific locations, they are all linked by this unifying principal. Unlike most neoplasms, leukaemia has inherent cell motility as leukocytes are required to move throughout the vascular system, suggesting that no mutations are required for anchorage independent growth. As such, it seems likely that leukaemias are inherently metastatic, endowed with the deadliest phenotype of cancer simply due to cell of origin. This article presents the biology of metastasis development and how leukaemia cells are inherently provided these phenotypic characteristics. It is then proposed how clinicians may be able to exploit the motility of leukaemia and metastatic emboli of other cancer types through an approach known as sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a treatment modality that combines chemotherapeutic agents with ultrasound to preferentially damage malignant cells. As experimental evidence has indicated, SDT is a promising therapeutic approach in need of clinical testing for further validation.\n",
      "Acute myelogenous leukaemia in childhood is considerably more resistant to chemotherapy than the acute lymphocytic leukaemias. Recently, more aggressive therapy has improved the outlook for children with this difficult form of leukaemia. Long-term disease-free survival of children achieving remission has been reported to be more than 40% in some studies. This paper reviews both the present concept of leukaemogenesis as well as some of the more recent therapeutic studies on childhood AML.\n",
      "The Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) can trace its origins to 1973. It now encompasses virtually all the major hospitals in Australia and New Zealand that treat leukaemias and lymphomas. Over the years the Group as a whole, and members individually, have participated in many clinical treatment trials for aggressive lymphomas. Initially trials were conceived and carried out locally, but in recent years, in addition to continuing its own studies, the Group has been a major contributor to international trials including two that have been particularly influential, known as MInT and CORAL. The MInT study confirmed the value of adding rituximab to standard chemotherapy for aggressive lymphomas; CORAL helped define optimum methods of autografting for relapse. The ALLG has contributed and continues to contribute to the improving outcome for patients with aggressive lymphomas.\n",
      "Blood-cell cancers (leukaemias, lymphomas and myeloma) are a very diverse group of neoplasms derived from a variety of stem cells at different hierarchical levels of haemopoietic and lymphoid cell development. This biological heterogeneity is likely to be associated with a variety of different etiological mechanisms. Correspondingly, a large number of inherited normal allelic variations might be expected to contribute to risk. Leukaemias alone have more than 200 different acquired (non-constitutive) molecular abnormalities but some are much more prevalent than others and are associated with biological subtypes with distinctive clinical or prognostic features. Balanced chromosome translocations are very common, together with simple gains or losses of chromosomes. Gene deletions and mutations are also relatively common, especially in more advanced disease. In several types of leukaemia and lymphoma, a transition from benign to malignant status can be tracked together with concurrent accrual of additional molecular abnormalities (e.g. chronic myeloid leukaemia evolving into blast crisis and follicular lymphoma becoming diffuse). The covert preclinical natural history of paediatric leukaemia has been revealed by 'back-tracking' using chromosomal translocation-gene-rated fusion gene sequences as clone-specific stable, specific and sensitive markers. Studies in identical twins, in archived neonatal blood spots of patients and in normal newborn cord bloods all support the contention that chromosomal translocations often initiate leukaemia in utero. Twin concordance rates (and animal modelling) suggest that further secondary genetic changes and exposures postnatally are, however, critical and this is endorsed by the finding that leukaemic fusion genes are present in normal newborn infants at a rate that far exceeds the cumulative risk of leukaemia. The natural history of leukaemic subtypes provides a useful framework for molecular epidemiological studies and significant advances have been made in this respect with infant and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n",
      "The successful identification of a range of leukaemia-specific and lymphoma-specific antigens in recent years has stimulated efforts to develop therapeutic vaccination strategies. A number of clinical trials have established the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination against tumour antigens, although there are limited data on the clinical efficacy of this approach in haematological malignancies. After encouraging results of phase I/II trials using idiotype vaccines in lymphoma, the outcome of the three phase III trials has been somewhat disappointing. Several other promising strategies are currently being developed to improve these results, including optimization of antigen delivery. In myeloid leukaemias, clinical trials of vaccination with peptides derived from a number of leukaemia antigens, including WT1, PR1, RHAMM and BCR-ABL, have shown evidence of immunogenicity, but limited data are available on the clinical efficacy of this approach. In this review, we focus on the results of clinical trials of vaccination in leukaemia and lymphoma, and discuss potential strategies to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in the future.\n",
      "Leukaemia is a bone marrow cancer occurring in acute and chronic subtypes. Acute leukaemia is a rapidly fatal cancer potentially causing death within a few weeks, if untreated. Leukaemia arises as a result of disruption to haematopoietic precursors, caused either by acquired gene fusions, gene mutations or inappropriate expression of the relevant oncogenes. Current treatment options have made significant progress, but the 5 year survival for acute leukaemia remains under 10% in elderly patients, and less than 50% for some types of acute leukaemia in younger adults. For chronic leukaemias longer survival is generally expected and for chronic myeloid leukaemia patients on tyrosine kinase inhibitors the median survival is not yet reached and is expected to exceed 10 years. Chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute leukaemia provide the mainstay of therapy for patients under 65 and both carry significant morbidity and mortality. Alternative and superior therapeutic strategies for acute leukaemias are urgently required. Recent molecular-based knowledge of recurring chromosome rearrangements, in particular translocations and inversions, has resulted in significant advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of leukaemia. Identification of a number of unique fusion genes has facilitated the development of highly specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Although delivery of siRNA using multifunctional nanoparticles has been investigated to treat solid cancers, the application of this approach to blood cancers is at an early stage. This review describes current treatments for leukaemia and highlights the potential of leukaemic fusion genes as therapeutic targets for RNA interference (RNAi). In addition, the design of biomimetic nanoparticles which are capable of responding to the physiological environment of leukaemia and their potential to advance RNAi therapeutics to the clinic will be critically evaluated.\n",
      "The Abelson (ABL) family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, ABL1 and ABL2, transduces diverse extracellular signals to protein networks that control proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. ABL1 was first identified as an oncogene required for the development of leukaemias initiated by retroviruses or chromosome translocations. The demonstration that small-molecule ABL kinase inhibitors could effectively treat chronic myeloid leukaemia opened the door to the era of targeted cancer therapies. Recent reports have uncovered roles for ABL kinases in solid tumours. Enhanced ABL expression and activation in some solid tumours, together with altered cell polarity, invasion or growth induced by activated ABL kinases, suggest that drugs targeting these kinases may be useful for treating selected solid tumours.\n",
      "The outlook for patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia has improved vastly with the use of all-trans retinoic acid. The development of this therapeutic agent stemmed from the finding that an abnormality of the retinoic acid receptor is involved in this disease. In the search for other molecular abnormalities in the acute leukaemias that might serve as therapeutic targets, the chromosomal translocations associated with this group of disorders have been helpful in indicating where to look for potential cancer genes. Some common signal-transduction pathways through which different such genes act have been identified, and compounds that interfere with these pathways are already being screened for.\n",
      "The WHO classification recognises three distinct disorders of large granular lymphocytes: T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia (T-LGL), chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of NK-cells (CLPD-NK) and agressive NK-cell leukaemia. Despite the different cell of origin, there is considerable overlap between T-LGL and CLPD-NK in terms of clinical presentation and therapy. Many patients are asymptomatic and do not require treatment. Therapy, with immunosuppressant agents such as low dose methotrexate or ciclosporin, is usually indicated to correct cytopenias. In contrast, aggressive NK-cell leukaemia and the rare CD56(+) aggressive T-LGL leukaemia follow a fulminant clinical course, affect younger individuals and require more intensive combination chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant in eligible patients. The relative rarity of these disorders means that there have been few clinical trials to inform management. However, there is now considerable interest in the pathogenesis of the chronic LGL leukaemias and this has stimulated early trials to evaluate novel agents which target the dysregulated apoptotic pathways characteristic of this disease.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an uncontrolled clonal proliferation of abnormal myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and blood. Advances in cancer genomics have revealed the spectrum of somatic mutations that give rise to human AML and drawn our attention to its molecular evolution and clonal architecture. It is now evident that most AML genomes harbour small numbers of mutations, which are acquired in a stepwise manner. This characteristic, combined with our ability to identify mutations in individual leukaemic cells and our detailed understanding of normal human and murine haematopoiesis, makes AML an excellent model for understanding the principles of cancer evolution. Furthermore, a better understanding of how AML evolves can help us devise strategies to improve the therapy and prognosis of AML patients. Here, we draw from recent advances in genomics, clinical studies and experimental models to describe the current knowledge of the clonal evolution of AML and its implications for the biology and treatment of leukaemias and other cancers.\n",
      "Like the acute leukaemias, the chronic leukaemias are broadly classified according to their cell lineage of origin. Chronic myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are the most common disease entities within the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, although several less common entities are well recognised within each broad subgroup. In common with the dramatic progress in the acute leukaemias, there has been considerable progress in our understanding of the biology and molecular genetics of the chronic leukaemias that is now being translated into significant therapeutic advances.\n",
      "The myelodysplastic syndromes are increasingly recognised clinical entities reflecting a stem cell defect that gives rise to ineffective clonal haematopoiesis. The spectrum extends from relatively indolent refractory anaemia through varying combinations of leucopoenia and thrombocytopenia to acute leukaemia. Diagnosis rests on marrow hypercellularity with dysplastic morphology, apoptosis and, often distinctive cytogenetic defects. Stratification to risk-related protocols range from occasional blood transfusions or erythropoietin through innovative options including thalidomide or amifostine to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in selected individuals. Acute myeloid leukaemia, conceptually segregated from preleukaemia, is treated differently although accumulating cellular and molecular data favour a more integrated approach. Morphology and immunophenotyping are complemented by molecular genetics. On this basis chemotherapy alone is sufficient in defined sub-groups whereas others benefit by autologous or allogeneic grafting. Attention to demonstrating minimal residual disease is the basis for more specific intervention exemplified by monoclonal antibodies or maturation-inducing agents as with retinoic acid in acute progranulocytic leukaemia\n",
      "Improvements in the chemotherapeutic and transplant regimens have had a significant impact in improving survival rates for paediatric leukaemia. However, there are still important problems to address including what options are available for patients with chemoresistant disease and what strategies are available to avoid the concerns regarding the toxicity associated with highly cytotoxic treatment regimens. Gene therapy and immunotherapy protocols hold great promise. Using gene transfer of a marker gene, a number of biological issues in the therapy of leukaemia have been addressed. For example, by gene marking autologous bone marrow grafts it has been possible to demonstrate that infused marrow contributes to relapse in acute and chronic myeloid leukaemias. In the allogeneic transplant setting, genetically modified T-cells have proven valuable for the prophylaxis and treatment of viral diseases and may have an important role in preventing or treating disease relapse. Gene transfer is also being used to modify tumour function, enhance immunogenicity, and confer drug-resistance to normal haematopoietic stem cells. With the continued scientific advancements in this field, gene therapy will almost certainly have a major impact on the treatment of paediatric leukaemia in the future.\n",
      "The process of malignant transformation in paediatric acute leukaemias is complex, requiring at least two deleterious events resulting in DNA damage. This damage ranges from point-mutations to double-strand DNA breaks leading to various types of chromosomal rearrangements. In this review we summarise the most common genetic aberrations for the three main subtypes of paediatric acute leukaemia: B-cell-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia. Several genetic aberrations are independent prognostic factors, and are now used in risk stratification for treatment. Molecular pathways activated by genetic aberrations could provide potential molecular targets for novel therapies. Some genetic aberrations represent sensitive targets for molecular detection of minimal residual disease. This provides hope for the development of targeted therapies, effective against leukaemic cells.\n",
      "Advances in the classification of acute leukaemias have led to improved outcomes for a substantial fraction of patients. However, chemotherapy resistance remains a major problem for specific subsets of acute leukaemias. Here, we propose that a molecularly distinct subtype of acute leukaemia with shared myeloid and T cell lymphoblastic features, which we term acute myeloid/T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (AMTL), is divided across 3 diagnostic categories owing to variable expression of markers deemed to be defining of myeloid and T-lymphoid lineages, such as myeloperoxidase and CD3. This proposed diagnostic group is supported by (i) retained myeloid differentiation potential during early T cell lymphoid development, (ii) recognition that some cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) harbour hallmarks of T cell development, such as T-cell receptor gene rearrangements and (iii) common gene mutations in subsets of AML and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), including WT1, PHF6, RUNX1 and BCL11B. This proposed diagnostic entity overlaps with early T cell precursor (ETP) T-ALL and T cell/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukaemias (MPALs), and also includes a subset of leukaemias currently classified as AML with features of T-lymphoblastic development. The proposed classification of AMTL as a distinct entity would enable more precise prospective diagnosis and permit the development of improved therapies for patients whose treatment is inadequate with current approaches.\n",
      "The graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) reaction that occurs after allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure patients with a variety of haematological malignancies. A heightened appreciation of the GVL effect has resulted in the development of reduced intensity transplant approaches, where antitumour effects occur predominantly as a consequence of the transplanted donor immune system. The recent success of these transplants in patients with acute and chronic leukaemias has led to trials investigating for graft-versus-tumour (GVT) effects in patients with treatment-refractory metastatic solid tumours. This review discusses evidence that immune replacement following allogeneic HCT is a potent form of cancer immunotherapy for patients with haematological and non-haematological malignancies.\n",
      "Although the standard approach to myeloid leukaemias remains chemotherapy, the agents currently available rarely result in cure. Recent advances in understanding the biology of these disorders have lead to the development of targeted treatment strategies. In acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), sodium phenylbutyrate and arsenic trioxide are agents which either induce differentiation or apoptosis and have been used to successfully achieve remission. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, STI-571, antisense oligonucleotides, and bcr-abl vaccines are strategies which focus on the oncogenic events in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). Two anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody conjugates, Y90-HuM195 and CMA-676, have been used in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and have shown some efficacy. Although the preliminary results with these targeted therapies are promising, further studies are needed to establish them as effective, less toxic alternatives to the current standard of care.\n",
      "The development of a second tumour, including treatment-related leukaemia (TRL), is the most devastating complication of intensive cancer chemotherapy. This is especially relevant in the paediatric population as over 70% of children diagnosed with a malignancy will now live at least 5 years. Most TRLs are myeloid leukaemias and carry an overall poor prognosis when compared with their de novo counterparts. Despite the well known association with specific cytotoxic agents, improved understanding of the pathogenesis and risk factors of TRL is ultimately essential if we are to develop successful strategies for prevention and treatment. Here we review these aspects, together with the clinical and diverse biological features of this complication and the efficacy of current therapy.\n",
      "We describe the value of three scoring systems for the characterisation of haemopoietic malignancies. One of the scorings was devised to disclose unusual cases of biphenotypic/mixed lineage acute leukemias and proved to be useful to distinguish such cases from those ALL or AML with aberrant expression of one or two markers of another lineage. The other two scorings aimed respectively: 1) to discriminate between B-CLL from all other B-cell disorders which evolve with leukemia and 2) distinguish between hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), HCL-variant and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, a group of B-cell diseases with circulating \"hairy\" lymphocytes. Findings derived from the application of the latter two scoring systems in a large number of cases demonstrated that both provide objective criteria to differentiate between the B-cell conditions studied and that no single marker considered in isolation allows the distinction between the various B-lymphoproliferative disorders.\n",
      "Acute leukaemia of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) is a rare complex entity with heterogeneous clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular genetic features and adverse outcome. According to World Health Organization 2008 classification, ALAL encompasses those leukaemias that show no clear evidence of differentiation along a single lineage. The rarity of ALAL and the lack of uniform diagnostic criteria have made it difficult to establish its cytogenetic features, although cytogenetic analysis reveals clonal chromosomal abnormalities in 59-91% of patients. This article focuses on the significance of cytogenetic analysis in ALAL supporting the importance of cytogenetic analysis in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, follow up and treatment selection of ALAL. It reviews in detail the types of chromosomal aberrations, their molecular background, their correlation with immunophenotype and age distribution and their prognostic relevance. It also summarizes some novel chromosome aberrations that have been observed only once. Furthermore, it highlights the ongoing and future research on ALAL in the field of cytogenetics.\n",
      "The leukaemias are a biologically and clinically heterogeneous group of malignancies, which manifest as clonal expansions of a single cell at different stages of lympho-haemopoietic development. The transformed cell acquires an unrestrained capacity for self-renewal and, in the case of the acute leukaemias, also fails to differentiate into functional mature cells. Historically leukaemias were classified using a combination of clinical and (presumed) cell lineage criteria. Thus, the four major subgroups of acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia and acute and chronic lymphoid leukaemia were recognised. Up until the last 10-15 years, patients within each major subgroup were treated along broadly similar lines. Genetic abnormalities have been recognised in certain leukaemias for over 50 years; however, the recent explosion in our understanding of the frequency and complexity of molecular abnormalities in the leukaemias has 'opened the door' for the design of more targeted therapies with the expectation that their incorporation into therapeutic regimens will be associated with greater efficacy and less off-target toxicity.\n",
      "Secondary leukaemias are common, accounting for more than 40% of all patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A clinical history of exposure to haematotoxins or radiation is helpful; however, many older patients are diagnosed with leukaemia with no antecedent history of exposure. These patients' disease show a remarkably similar phenotype to classic therapy-related leukaemia. The specific cytogenetic abnormalities common to MDS, alkylating-agent-related AML and poor-prognosis AML (3q-, -5, 5q-, -7, 7q-, +8, +9, 11q-, 12p-, -18, -19,20q-, +21, t(1;7), t(2;11)), probably reflect a common pathogenesis distinct from that of other de novo AMLs, although the pathogenetic pathway has yet to be elucidated. Possibly, tumour suppressor genes are implicated and genomic instability may be a cause of multiple unbalanced chromosomal translocations or deletions. Typically, these patients are either elderly or have a history of exposure to alkylating agents or environmental exposure 5-7 years prior to diagnosis. Another distinct entity affects the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene located on 11q23. These account for about 3% of patients with therapy-related leukaemia and have a short latency period from exposure, usually to an inhibitor of topoisomerase II. Other therapy-related patients with t(8:21), inv16 or t(15;17) translocations should be treated as any other de novo AML with similar cytogenetics. In summary, the major prognostic factor is related to the pathogenetic mechanisms of the leukaemia. Cytogenetics and molecular features are a better predictor of outcome than patient history. Patients should receive standard induction therapy. However, the long-term outcome is relatively poor; the best results being obtained among patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation.\n",
      "The need for reproducibility in the classification of acute leukaemia has made it necessary to incorporate information derived from new techniques which have become essential for the study of these disorders. In addition to classic morphology and cytochemistry (FAB proposals), it is necessary to add immunology and cytogenetics (MIC proposals), as well as to investigate further the biological and diagnostic significance of molecular events. As a result of these investigations a new group of leukaemias merit recognition as distinct entities. These include three types of ALL with specific chromosome abnormalities, namely, i) t (9;22), ii) t (4;11) and iii) t (1;19) and four subtypes of AML, i) with minimal differentiation or AML-M0, ii) with basophilic precursors or M2Baso, iii) AML (M4/M5) with t (8;16) and iv) AML with trilineage myelodysplasia. Biphenotypic acute leukaemia constitutes also a distinct entity with features of ALL and AML and represents a malignancy probably affecting multipotent stem cells. We propose an objective evaluation system for biphenotypic leukaemias based on a score in which the various lineage markers are graded according to their known specificity.\n",
      "Many cancers seem to depend on a small population of 'cancer stem cells' for their continued growth and propagation. The leukaemia stem cell (LSC) was the first such cell to be described. The origins of these cells are controversial, and their biology - like that of their normal-tissue counterpart, the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) - is still not fully elucidated. However, the LSC is likely to be the most crucial target in the treatment of leukaemias, and a thorough understanding of its biology - particularly of how the LSC differs from the HSC - might allow it to be selectively targeted, improving therapeutic outcome.\n",
      "Leukaemia is the single most common childhood malignancy. With modern treatment regimens, survival in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) approaches 90%. Only about 70% of children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) achieve long term survival. Patients who relapse have a dismal prognosis. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed to improve treatment outcomes in newly-diagnosed patients with a poor prognosis and for patients with relapsed/refractory disease that have limited treatment options. One promising approach in treating haematological malignancies has been the use of monoclonal antibodies to target cell surface antigens expressed on malignant cells. Most success with monoclonal antibody therapy in the treatment of haematological malignancies has come in the setting of adult B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with the addition of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab to standard treatment regimens. In order to further advance treatment of haematological malignancies, novel monoclonal antibodies continue to be developed that target a variety of cell surface antigens. Several antibodies continue to be investigated in childhood leukaemias. This review will discuss the development of monoclonal antibodies that target a variety of cell surface antigens for the treatment of childhood ALL and the use of the anti-CD33 antibody gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the treatment of childhood AML.\n",
      "The WT1 gene is essential for kidney development and is mutated in some Wilms tumours. It is also expressed at a high level in many acute leukaemias and in some haematopoietic progenitor cells, and mutations have been found in leukaemias. The function of WT1, which is a zinc finger protein and has domains characteristic of transcription factors, is not well understood. The level of expression is highest in leukaemias with immature phenotypes. Expression of WT1 is downregulated during differentiation of leukaemic cell lines and high levels of WT1 expression can cause cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. This may reflect a role in the control of normal haematopoiesis, which can be abrogated by mutations in the gene and form part of the pathway towards leukaemogenesis.\n",
      "Prolymphocytic leukaemias of B and T cell subtype are rare diseases. Despite recent advances in immunophenotyping and molecular cytogenetics, leading to a better understanding of the underlying cell biology of the prolymphocytic leukaemias, prognosis for these patients remains poor. Purine analogues and monoclonal antibodies have shown efficacy in B-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia although further studies are warranted. Monoclonal antibody therapy with alemtuzumab has significantly improved outcome in T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) but responses are still transient and further disease progression is inevitable. While allogeneic stem cell transplant is an attractive option, due to the older age group of T-PLL patients the morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure is significant.\n",
      "An optimised diagnostic setting in acute leukaemias combines cytomorphology and cytochemistry, multiparameter immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays. This allows classification and definition of biologically defined and prognostically relevant subtypes, and allows directed treatment in some sub-entities. Over the last years the microarray technology has helped to quantify simultaneously the expression status of ten thousands of genes in single experiments. This novel approach will hopefully become an essential tool for the molecular classification of acute leukaemias in the near future. It can be anticipated that new biologically defined and clinically relevant subtypes of leukaemia will be identified based on their unique gene expression profiles. This method may therefore guide therapeutic decisions and should be investigated in a diagnostic setting in parallel to established standard methods.\n",
      "With evolving diagnostic and therapeutic advances, the survival of patients with acute leukaemia has considerably improved. This has led to an increase in the variability of ocular presentations in the form of side effects of the treatment and the ways leukaemic relapses are being first identified as an ocular presentation. Leukaemia may involve many ocular tissues either by direct infiltration, haemorrhage, ischaemia, or toxicity due to various chemotherapeutic agents. Ocular involvement may also be seen in graft-versus-host reaction in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, or simply as increased susceptibility to infections as a result of immunosuppression that these patients undergo. This can range from simple bacterial conjunctivitis to an endophthalmitis. Leukaemia can present as pathology in the adnexae, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens, vitreous, retina, choroid, and optic nerve. Recognition of the varied ocular presentations is also important in assessing the course and prognosis of leukaemia. We have presented a systematic approach taking each part of the eye in turn and outlining how leukaemia has been shown to affect it.\n",
      "The marked association of abnormalities of chromosome 11 long arm, band q23, with human leukaemia led to the identification of the 11q23 gene called MLL (or HTRX, HRX, TRX1, ALL-1). MLL can become fused with one of a remarkable panoply of genes from other chromosome locations in individual leukaemias, leading to either acute myeloid or lymphoid tumours (hence the name MLL for mixed lineage leukaemia). The unusual finding that a single protein could be involved in both myeloid and lymphoid malignancies and that the truncated protein could do so as a fusion with very disparate partners has prompted studies to define the molecular role of MLL-fusions in leukaemogenesis and to the development of MLL-controlled mouse models of leukaemogenesis. These studies have defined MLL-fusion proteins as regulators of gene expression, controlling such elements as HOX genes, and have indicated a variety of mechanisms by which MLL-fusion proteins contribute to leukaemogenesis.\n",
      "Numerous immunophenotypic features have been examined for their potential prognostic significance in predicting treatment outcome in leukaemias. These include immunophenotypic subgroups of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and immature acute myeloid leukaemia, expression of individual surface antigens or combined immunophenotypic features, and more recently, molecules mediating the multidrug resistance phenotype or being involved in the regulation of drug-induced apoptosis. Most previous studies investigating the prognostic significance of antigen expression in leukaemia have not used the information provided by multiparameter flow cytometry and have chosen rather arbitrary cut-off points for marker positivity. Moreover, given significant associations between immunophenotypic features and genetic abnormalities in leukaemic cells, immunophenotyping as an independent predictor of treatment outcome has been questioned. Thus, except for lineage assignment of leukaemic blasts and definition of maturational status in ALL, information provided by immunophenotyping is currently not applied to risk-classification systems or used for planning patient treatment in leukaemia. We review some of the recent findings regarding the prognostic impact of distinct immunophenotypic features in acute leukaemias and myelodysplastic syndrome.\n",
      "Gene expression profiling (GEP) enables the simultaneous investigation of the expression of tens of thousands of genes and was successfully introduced in leukaemia research a decade ago. Aiming to better understand the diversity of genetic aberrations in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), pioneer studies investigated and confirmed the predictability of many cytogenetic and molecular subclasses in AML and ALL. In addition, GEP can define new prognostic subclasses within distinct leukaemia subgroups, as illustrated in AML with normal karyotype. Another approach is the development of treatment-specific sensitivity assays, which might contribute to targeted therapy studies. Finally, GEP might enable the detection of new molecular targets for therapy in patients with acute leukaemia. Meanwhile, large multicentre studies, e.g. the Microarray Innovations in LEukaemia (MILE) study, prepare for a standardised introduction of GEP in leukaemia diagnostic algorithms, aiming to translate this novel methodology into clinical routine for the benefit of patients with the complex disorders of AML and ALL.\n",
      "ALL is characterized by small to medium sized leukaemic blasts with a rather low grade of cell-to-cell variability. The nucleocytoplasmic ratio is high with just a small cytoplasmic rim in many cases. The cytoplasm tends to be moderately basophilic. Usually, though not in each instance, it is agranular and free of vacuoles. The chromatin is more condensed than in AML and the nucleoli tend to be indistinct. The FAB classification of haematological malignancies separates ALL into three categories: ALL L1, L2, and L3. However, just the identification of the L3 variant is of major importance. The L3 cells are medium sized to large and are characterized by intensely basophilic and moderately abundant cytoplasm with prominent cytoplasmic vacuolation in the bone marrow but not necessarily in the peripheral blood. According to our experience there is a high but not universal correlation of the L3 phenotype as defined by morphology with the immunologically defined B-ALL with surface expression of immunoglobulins. Until recently, acute leukaemias proving negative for all cytochemical tests especially for the PAS reaction and for the focal type of acid phosphatase, were termed 'acute undifferentiated leukaemia' (AUL). However, this morphological/cytochemical diagnosis may be confused with the immunological diagnosis of unclassifiable leukaemia. Since almost any of these cases can be recognized as ALL or AML by immunology, the term AUL should be reserved for cases which can be classified neither by morphology/cytochemistry nor by immunology. The morphological and cytochemical distinction of ALL from poorly differentiated AML remains a problem, especially if the FAB criteria for distinguishing ALL from AML by cytochemistry (3% of the blasts positive for peroxidase) are applied rigidly. A small but significant percentage of poorly differentiated leukaemias have less than 3% of the blasts positive for peroxidase and the myeloid nature of the leukaemia can be identified by cytochemistry. The absence of blasts being positive for peroxidase is no reliable indicator for the lymphatic nature of a leukaemia, even if the PAS reaction is typical for ALL. The morphological diagnosis of ALL needs confirmation by immunology in each instance.\n",
      "Myeloid leukaemias are frequently associated with translocations and mutations of tyrosine kinase genes. The products of these oncogenes, including BCR-ABL, TEL-PDGFR, Flt3 and c-Kit, have elevated tyrosine kinase activity and transform haematopoietic cells, mainly by augmentation of proliferation and enhanced viability. Activated ABL kinases are associated with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Mutations in platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta are associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Flt3 or c-Kit cooperate with other types of oncogenes to create fully transformed acute leukaemias. Elevated activity of these tyrosine kinases is crucial for transformation, thus making the kinase domain an ideal target for therapeutic intervention. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors for various kinases are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and are potentially useful therapeutic agents in myeloid leukaemias. Here, the authors review the signalling activities, mechanism of transformation and therapeutic targeting of several tyrosine kinase oncogenes important in myeloid leukaemias.\n",
      "Total body irradiation (TBI) is an all-pervasive systemic treatment modality which is well suited to the sterilization of small numbers of widely dispersed radiosensitive cells. This makes it attractive for the treatment of leukaemia or lymphoma in remission. It is unlikely that hypoxia or repopulation will be a problem in TBI treatment of leukaemia, and clonal resistance to radiation occurs less readily than to drugs. Leukaemic cells are often radiosensitive with poor repair capacities but considerable variation is seen in laboratory studies and leukaemias may be highly individual. It is possible that programmed cell death (apoptosis) contributes to leukaemic cell killing and variability of apoptosis may give rise to biological individuality. Molecular methodologies may now be used to monitor leukaemic cell populations and may enable semi-quantitative predictive assays of radiosensitivity. When the malignant cell population is not uniformly distributed throughout the body, as in lymphoma, non-uniform TBI is appropriate, e.g. by addition of local boosts or by the combination of TBI with radiolabelled antibody treatment. Major side-effects mostly relate to critical organs with late-responding characteristics (low alpha/beta ratio, high sensitivity to fraction size or dose rate). The radiobiological basis of developmental effects in children is not well understood. In future, improved selectivity of TBI may come from molecular biological strategies to sensitize malignant cells and to protect normal tissues.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to determine the expression of Gravin (a tumor suppressor gene belonging to the A kinase anchoring protein family) in samples of acute leukaemia and to explore its association with the prognosis. The study group consisted of 162 people (137 patients with acute leukaemia and 25 volunteers as control). Real-time quantitative PCR was used to determine the gene expression and beta Actin used as a control gene. The results were evaluated with Comparative Ct method. Gravin beta-Actin DeltaCt was statistically different between patients and controls (p value < 0.001). The Gravin expression was found to be decreased 11-fold when compared with controls and was found to be decreased in 106 cases (77.5%). There was an inverse correlation between gravin expression and overall survival. The Gravin expression was found to be decreased in samples of acute leukaemia and was associated with an inferior overall survival. Because of paradoxical results, there is a need for more studies exploring gravin isoforms and other related gene expressions.\n",
      "Clofarabine, a synthesised adenosine nucleoside, has recently demonstrated single-agent activity in the acute leukaemias. Originally developed to capture the best qualities of cladribine and fludarabine, clofarabine contains halogenated carbons, rendering it resistant to inactivating enzymes and maintaining its stability in acidic environments. Like other adenosine nucleosides, clofarabine acts by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, thereby depleting the amount of intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates available for DNA replication and also resulting in premature DNA chain termination. Clofarabine has also been shown to induce apoptosis in transformed cell lines, indicating that clofarabine results in cell death in both cycling and non-cycling cells. Interest in the development of clofarabine was initially hampered by the availability of other active nucleoside analogues for the treatment of haematological malignancies. However, the results of several early-phase trials evaluating the use of clofarabine in acute leukaemias in adults and children have rekindled enthusiasm for further investigation into its use. This article describes the development, pharmacology, toxicity and clinical activity of clofarabine, as well as discuss its potential role in the treatment of acute leukaemia.\n",
      "We studied the B lymphocyte metaphases in 78 of 94 cases of CLL, 24 of our 28 hairy cell leukaemias, 4 CLL which transformed into prolymphocytic leukaemia and 8 original prolymphocytic leukaemias. Twelve CLL were carriers of trisomy 12, 13 of this trisomy 12 with other abnormalities and 15 had other abnormalities without trisomy 12. Trisomy 12 seemed to be more frequent in patients with CLL or prolymphocytic leukaemia with a monoclonal gammopathy. In contrast to our previous results, the isolated finding of a trisomy 12 had an influence on the median survival.\n",
      "The pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) frequently requires at least 3 mutations in different cellular pathways. In many cases, mutations in proliferation/survival mechanisms and differentiation pathways are involved. Genetic aberrations explain the pathogenesis of AML, provide prognostic criteria and guide drug design for future therapy. Since the last update of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumours of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues in 2008, there have been many discovers regarding the genomic landscape of AML and molecular assays for the detection of minimal residual disease. The identification of unique biomarkers associated with AML, derived from gene expression analysis and next-generation sequencing, may improve significantly the diagnostic criteria. In the new WHO classification published in 2017, several new AML entities are added. Moreover, the prognostic and diagnostic relevance of recently identified molecular features is reviewed and integrated into existing sets of criteria. This article reviews the most common tests and procedures for AML diagnosis, including morphology, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and molecular genetic testing. The major changes in the new WHO classification for AML are also remarked.\n",
      "The leukaemias vary in their response to therapy. In acute myeloid leukaemia, for instance, response to therapy is poorer in older than in younger patients. One explanation for this is that in older patients the acute myeloid leukaemia is more likely to have arisen from a pluripotent stem cell than from a lineage-restricted progenitor cell; the former has a high self-renewal capacity, an active drug-efflux pump, and high content of anti-apoptotic proteins, all of which contribute to chemoresistance. Unravelling the biology of the leukaemias should help in the development of novel therapies.\n",
      "Immunophenotyping improves both accuracy and reproducibility of the FAB classification and is considered particularly useful for identifying poorly differentiated FAB subtypes of AML, such as AML with minimal differentiation (M0), microgranular promyelocytic leukaemia (M3V), and megakaryoblastic leukaemia (M7). Immunological studies of myeloid leukaemic blasts has become critical also in identifying biphenotypic leukaemias and AML expressing lymphoid-associated markers (Ly+ AML). At present, while the prognostic value of individual antigen expressions is still controversial, due to technical questions, the immunological detection of MRD seems to be important in monitoring AML patients in remission and, perhaps, in detecting leukaemic cell contamination into bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells collected for autologous transplantation. In addition, the relationship established between genetic abnormalities and certain phenotypes within different FAB subtypes suggests that, in the future, immunophenotypical studies could be used for the screening of AML cases carrying specific genetic aberrations. Compared to acute leukaemias, little information is available concerning immunological patterns in MDS, and the role of the immunophenotype in diagnosis, subclassification, and prognosis of MDS is currently not well established.\n",
      "The proceedings of the third workshop of the molecular biology/bone marrow transplantation (BMT) study group held in January 1991 in Verona, Italy. This workshop was convened to review progress in the application of molecular techniques to the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) as well as other haematologic malignancies. The results of polymerase chainreaction studies in 157 CML patients 1-90 months post BMT suggest that leukaemia is frequently detectable for the first 12 months but rarely detected thereafter except in patients known to have a high risk of relapse. In the acute leukaemias and lymphomas there is a rapidly increasing number of leukaemia-specific as well as clone-specific molecular markers now available for the detection of minimal disease. It may be possible to coordinate multi-center prospective studies to investigate the role of these markers in the diagnosis and follow-up of haematologic malignancies.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To determine the patterns of leukaemias seen in Malawians at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) and to compare the findings with those from elsewhere. An overview of the problems encountered in the management of leukaemia in developing countries especially those in sub-Saharan Africa are highlighted. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive analysis of consecutive leukaemia cases seen from January 1994 through December 1998. RESULTS: Of the 95 leukaemia patients diagnosed during the study period, childhood (0-15 years) leukaemia occurred in 27 (28.4%) patients while adulthood (above 15 years) leukaemia accounted for 68 (71.6%) patients. The main leukaemia types were: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 14 (14.7%), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) 25 (26.3%), chronic myeloid (granulocytic) leukaemia (CML) 32 (33.7%), chronic lymphocytic (lymphatic) leukaemia (CLL) 22 (23.2%) and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) two (2.1%) patients. Most of the acute leukaemia (AL) cases occurred in the six to 15 year age bracket with a male preponderance. In ALL, lymphadenopathy was the commonest presenting feature followed by pallor (92.9%) while in the AML group, pallor occurred in 80% of cases. Abdominal swelling (87.5%) due to splenomegaly (81.3%) were the main clinical features in the CML group whereas lymphadenopathy (63.6%) followed by splenomegaly (59.1%) were the dominant presenting features in CLL. Haematologically, although leucocytosis characterised both acute and chronic leukaemias, most cases of acute leukaemia presented with more severe anaemia (Hb < 7 g/dl) and marked thrombocytopenia (Platelet count < 50 x 10(9)/l) than the chronic leukaemias. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The study shows that leukaemias are not rare in Malawi and cases which were diagnosed in this series probably only represent the tip of the iceberg. While there is need to increase diagnostic awareness among clinicians and laboratory staff, the severe chronic shortage of cytotoxic drugs and lack of supportive care facilities commonly encountered in developing countries should be realistically addressed through cost-sharing, cost recovery, adequate government subvention and donations from charitable organisations.\n",
      "TG-Interacting Factor 1 (Tgif1) affects proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and regulates self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To determine its impact on leukaemic haematopoiesis, we induced acute or chronic myeloid leukaemias (AML or CML) in mice by enforced expression of MLL-AF9 or BCR-ABL, respectively, in Tgif1+/+ or Tgif1-/- haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and transplanted them into syngeneic recipients. We find that loss of Tgif1 accelerates leukaemic progression and shortens survival in mice with either AML or CML. Leukaemia-initiating cells (LICs) occur with higher frequency in AML among mice transplanted with MLL-AF9-transduced Tgif1-/- HSPCs than with Tgif1+/+ BMCs. Moreover, AML in mice generated with Tgif1-/- HSPCs are chemotherapy resistant and relapse more rapidly than those whose AML arose in Tgif1+/+ HSPCs. Whole transcriptome analysis shows significant alterations in gene expression profiles associated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and retinoic acid (RA) signalling pathways because of Tgif1 loss. These findings indicate that Tgif1 has a protective role in myeloid leukaemia initiation and progression, and its anti-leukaemic contributions are connected to TGF-beta- and RA-driven functions.\n",
      "Leukaemias are a heterogeneous group of tumours including acute and chronic forms. Considerable efforts have been made to identify risk factors for these diseases, but only a minority of leukaemia cases can currently be attributed to identified or hypothesized factors. This review highlights recent epidemiological literature concerning adult leukaemia, discussing in detail the hereditary, environmental and medical risks. Chromosomal syndromes and genetically based diseases carry a high risk of leukaemia, but rarely occur in the population. Environmental and occupational exposures to chemicals including pesticides have been widely studied, although the results are not consistent, with the exception of benzene. Smoking seems to be a weak causal risk factor. The risk of ionizing radiation has further been quantified in recent studies, although the effects of low doses have not yet been clarified. The results for non-ionizing radiation continue to be inconsistent, but a large effect of electromagnetic fields on the risk of leukaemia appears to be unlikely. Medically applied radio- and chemotherapy are clearly associated with subsequent leukaemia development, and there are links between leukaemia and viral infections. Future research should emphasize the shortcomings in exposure assessment that pervade many studies, and interactions between different risk factors need to be taken into consideration.\n",
      "Splenic irradiation (SI) was the first efficient treatment for chronic leukaemia, but with the emergence of effective drugs its use has been more and more restricted to advanced cases presenting with splenomegaly. But in selected patients who are not responsive or not suitable to drug treatment, SI may offer still an effective, low toxic and cost-effective palliative modality. Eight studies of SI in chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) including 198 patients, six reports about SI in prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL), including 18 patients, one study and six case reports about SI in hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and nine studies about SI in myeloproliferative disorders has been analyzed. In CLL, symptoms of splenomegaly have been improved in 50-87% of all patients with overall doses between 4 and 10 Gy in mostly 1-Gy fractions. PLL seems to be more resistant to SI with a median response rate of 66%. Casuistic reports described also efficacy of SI in HCL patients using similar radiation schedules. Symptomatic relief is also provided by SI in myeloproliferative disorders using lower overall doses between 1 and 9 Gy with small single fractions of 0.25 Gy (median). Acute toxicity was low in lymphoid disorders, but higher in myeloproliferative disorders with severe cytopenia in 10-30% of all cases, indicating the need for a cautious fractionation schedule. Interestingly, even complete systemic remissions after SI in all types of lymphoproliferative disorders have been described. Different mechanisms underlying SI such as direct cell kill, immune modulation via changes in lymphocyte subsets or cytokine induction or \"radiotherapeutic\" splenectomy with high doses are discussed.\n",
      "Although progress has been made in the management of acute leukaemias, most patients who fail to respond to front-line therapies with cytostatic agents and stem cell transplantation, or who relapse after an initial response die from progressive disease. Novel treatment modalities exploiting donor-derived natural killer (NK) cells generate an alloreactive graft-versus-leukaemia response and eliminate the residual malignant clones in transplanted patients. NK cells are components of the innate immunity playing an important role in the surveillance of human tumours. Recognition of malignant cells depends on a dynamic balance between antagonistic functions of an array of NK activating and inhibitory receptors. The natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) are NK cell-specific and together with the NKG2D receptor are responsible for NK cell activation and tumour cell killing. The killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) recruit phosphatases and can antagonise the activating signals and prevent the cytolytic NK cell programme. Understanding of the integration of these multiple signals at the molecular level is central for exploring the cytolytic function of NK cells. This review describes molecular mechanisms of NK receptor-ligand interactions controlling target cell recognition and addresses the potential of NK cells for the specific elimination of leukaemic clones with the goal of advancing immunotherapy of leukaemia.\n",
      "Flow cytometry is semi-automated study of antigen profile of cells using the Scatchard principle of antigen-antibody binding and fluorochrome-based detection systems. Flow cytometric evaluation of cellular proteomics has become an integral part of the laboratory diagnosis and classification of haematopoietic neoplasms. Recent technical advances in lasers, monoclonal antibodies, fluorochromes, and computer-based color compensation algorithms have expanded the usefulness of flow cytometry. Detection of minimal residual disease by flow cytometry in leukaemias and lymphomas is incorporated in many treatment protocols. Finding of aberrant maturation pattern of granulocytes offers a sensitive screening tool for early diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes. Detailed proteomic analysis of leukemias is helping more precise prognostic and biological stratification.\n",
      "Canine acute leukaemias (ALs) have a poor prognosis, with reported survival times (ST) of only a few weeks or months. Also, clinical studies assessing prognostic factors are lacking. This study aims to retrospectively assess variables that predict ST in dogs with AL, and to identify correlations between outcome and therapeutic protocols. Diagnosis and sub-classification into AL subtypes was made based on haematological findings, morphological assessment and flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Clinical-pathological features of AL subtypes at presentation concurred with those described in the literature. A normal neutrophil count at presentation significantly prolonged ST (P = 0.027). Additionally, there was a trend for anaemic dogs to have shorter survival compared with those without anaemia, and the incorporation of cytosine in the chemotherapy protocol produced a moderate but not significant increase in median ST for dogs with AL. Further prospective studies with standardized treatments are needed to confirm and improve our results.\n",
      "The leukaemias are a diverse group of bone marrow malignancies. In general, the acute leukaemias are potentially curable with standard combination chemotherapy but the chronic leukaemias, despite a more prolonged, indolent course, are incurable. Newer antimetabolite agents offer the promise of improved survival in the chronic leukaemias of lymphocytic origin. Although it may not be indicated for all types and is generally suitable only for younger patients, bone marrow transplantation provides improved prospects for cure for most types of leukaemia and the only chance of cure for some.\n",
      "There is insufficient evidence linking excess body weight to risk of myeloid malignancies. We investigated this association using data from the Cancer Prevention Study-II (CPS-II), and a meta-analysis of published cohort studies. Among 152 090 CPS-II participants, 387 acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), 100 chronic myeloid leukaemias (CML) and 170 MDS were identified over 21 years of follow-up. In CPS-II, body mass index (BMI) was weakly associated with risk of CML (hazard ratio [HR] = 1·04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0·99-1·09 per 1 unit increase in BMI), AML (HR = 1·01, 95% CI: 0·98-1·03) and MDS (HR = 1·03, 95% CI: 0·99-1·07). After controlling for other anthropometric factors, no clear association was observed for height, BMI at age 18 years or weight change. In the meta-analysis (n = 7117 myeloid leukaemias), BMI 25-29·9 kg/m2 (HRpooled  = 1·36, 95% CI: 1·12-1·59) and BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (HRpooled  = 1·43, 95% CI: 1·18-1·69) were associated with higher risk of myeloid leukaemia overall, compared to a BMI <25 kg/m2 . Likewise, BMI ≥25 kg/m2 was positively associated with both AML and CML risk individually in the meta-analysis. These results underscore the need for large studies to detect associations with rare cancers, and show a modest, but positive association between excess body weight and myeloid malignancy risk.\n",
      "This chapter describes the current role of unrelated donor stem cell transplantation (UD-SCT) in the management of leukaemia. The available data are scant and incomplete and there are few randomized studies comparing UD-SCT with alternative therapies. Patients with many of the leukaemias require prolonged follow-up after allogeneic SCT to determine whether they are cured; the registry-based comparisons that have been initiated reflect the results achievable some years ago and may not help us in deciding what is best in 2001. In addition, new therapies such as ST1571, even though the long-term outcome of patients treated with this agent is uncertain, may affect which patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia we decide to recommend for transplant. The focus here is on acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, as well as the myelodysplastic syndromes. Patient selection, conditioning strategies, comparison with other therapies, timing of transplant and the major causes of treatment failure are discussed, and there is an exploration of where improvement will come from.\n",
      "The study included 1742 patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemias (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL), Kyiv city residents and patients from 20 regions of Ukraine. Bone marrow and blood smears were sent at diagnosis to Reference Center. The analysis was based on May-Grünvald-Giemza (MGG) stain and cytochemical reactions (MPO, acNSE, CAE, AP, PAS). Immunocytochemical techniques (APAAP, LSAB) and broad panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against lineage specific and differentiation antigens of leukocytes were employed for immunophenotyping of leukemic blast cells directly in blood and bone marrow smears. Different types of AML were defined by the expression of the cell surface and cytoplasmic antigens. Immunocytochemical study was required especially in diagnosing of AML with minimal differentiation, acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia, acute erythroid leukaemia and acute leukaemias of ambiguous lineage. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemias was broadly classified into B-lineage and T-lineage ALL. According to the degree of B-lymphoid differentiation of the blast cells four subtypes of B-lineage ALL were established. T-lineage ALL observed in patients were also divided into four subtypes. Immunocytochemical examination was required to diagnose AL of ambiguous lineage with no clear evidence of lineage differentiation (acute undifferentiated leukaemia) or those with blasts that express markers of more than one lineage (mixed phenotype acute leukaemias).\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to independently test the hypothesis that leukaemia incidence is higher in proximity to estuaries. METHODS: Electoral wards were classified as to whether they included estuarine, coastal or only inland features. Rates of different adult and childhood leukaemias were computed for each ward category; that is, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) aged 0-79 and for all childhood leukaemias combined (aged 0-14). RESULTS: Poisson regression analysis controlling for the effects of sex, age, and socioeconomic and urban-rural status, showed no statistically significant differences in incidence between wards with different levels of estuarine classification. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis created from an earlier dataset that a link exists between leukaemia and residence near estuaries is not upheld.\n",
      "T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (T-CLL) has recently been reclassified under the heading of T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) because of its unfavourable clinical course, independently of the morphologic features. This rare neoplasm usually shows CD4+/CD8- phenotype. Herein we report on two cases of T-PLL with CD8 expression that correspond to a possible variant of the disease first proposed by Hui et al. in 1987. These cases presented with malignant cells showing immunophenotypic features that can be easily identified and distinguished from other peripheral T-cell leukemias. However, the total number of cases studied is inadequate for defining a discrete clinico-pathologic entity with characteristic clinical features and cytogenetical abnormalities. An international collaboration in which tissue from similar cases is referred to a central pathologist for immunophenotyping and cytogenetical study, and clinical data are centrally compiled, may assist in defining this rare malady as a discrete clinico-pathologic entity.\n",
      "The manifestations, diagnosis and management of the rarer chronic myeloid leukemias are reviewed, with special attention to problems that affect elderly patients. The spectrum of disorders includes atypical myeloproliferative syndrome, so-called Ph-negative CGL, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and leukemias characterized by chronic proliferation of neutrophil, eosinophil, or basophil leukocytes. These latter are sometimes difficult to differentiate from chronic nonleukemic proliferations of the index cells. Termination in an acute myeloid leukaemia that is usually refractory to treatment may occur in any of the above disorders but is not a constant event.\n",
      "Patients treated with radiation and cytotoxic agents for a variety of neoplastic conditions develop with increased frequency a secondary leukaemia, usually a form of acute myeloblastic leukaemia. The authors illustrate and discuss the various morphological and cytobiological which characterize the \"preleukaemic phase\", and which comprise myelodysplastic alterations, cytochemical abnormalities, concerning the presence of glycogen and free iron in the red cell series, as well as a number of changes in enzymatic activities in the myeloid series, cytokinetic changes, indicative of accumulation of cells in G0 and G1, cytogenetic non-random abnormalities, involving specific chromosomes, and finally in vitro cultures which show a reduction in colony formation. The authors underline the differences between primary and secondary preleukaemic myelodysplastic states, consisting in the presence in the latter of frequent hypocellularity, fibrosis and almost invariability a clear involvement of multiple cell lines.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) is considered a separate entity in the context of acute leukaemias. AUL is extremely rare in both humans and dogs, has a rapid clinical course and does not respond to treatment. It is characterised by the presence of blast cells within the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood at levels ≥ 20% and even up to 100% of all nucleated cells. Blast cells are unable to be differentiated on morphological, cytochemical and phenotypic criteria into myeloid or lymphoid lineages because of their immaturity and/or atypia. CASE REPORT: An 8-year-old German Shepherd dog was referred for depression, asthenia, mild anaemia, thrombocytopenia and marked leucocytosis. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, bilateral nephromegaly and enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes. Echocardiography revealed biventricular hypertrophy with abnormal tissue density of the myocardium. Blood and bone marrow smears were composed of 95% unclassifiable and/or atypical blast cells and signs of dysplasia of the erythroid and thrombocytic/megakaryocytic lineages were present. Blast cells were negative for all cytochemical stains used and flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed 85% of total leucocytes consisting of small-to-medium-sized cells, negative for all lymphoid and myeloid markers except CD45 and CD34. After necropsy, cytology and histology revealed that blast cells had diffusely infiltrated all tissues examined. Both erythroid and megakaryocytic extramedullary haemopoiesis was also detected in the spleen, lymph nodes and liver. All immunohistochemical stains used were negative. CONCLUSION: On the basis of all the results, a diagnosis of acute leukaemia involving a very primitive haematopoietic precursor was made.\n",
      "Despite a proliferation of epidemiological studies during the past two decades, aetiologies of the leukaemias remain poorly understood, and characterisation of descriptive patterns has been limited. Recent publications of international mortality and incidence data, along with the expanding U.S. database, make a comprehensive assessment of leukaemia patterns particularly timely. Total leukaemia mortality has dramatically declined among children and increased among the elderly, while incidence has declined somewhat (for Caucasian and African-American females) or remained stable (for African-American males) during the past two decades in the United States. Population-based 5-year relative survival for total leukaemia has risen substantially among children since the mid-1970s, and improved slightly among other age groups in the U.S., where survival is consistently higher among Caucasians than African-Americans, but differs little by gender. In a detailed assessment by leukaemia subtype, some important differences in geographic, racial/ethnic, age and trend patterns are identified, suggesting that the subtypes may have different aetiologic factors. Proven and suspected risk factors cannot explain more than a small fraction of the observed geographic and temporal variation in incidence. Several noteworthy subtype-specific characteristics or trends warrant further investigation: for acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), increasing incidence, with higher rates in Spanish and Latino populations; for chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL), declining incidence, with dramatically low rates among Asians; for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), increasing incidence among African-American males; and for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), declining rates among Caucasian but not among African-Americans.\n",
      "The standard methods for classifying acute leukaemias now include morphology, cytochemistry and membrane markers. Major advances in immunology, in particular the development of monoclonal antibodies (McAb) with lineage specificity, have provided objective positive criteria for the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The FAB group has recognised the importance of McAb for the classification of some forms of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), such as megakaryoblastic leukaemia, AML-M7, in which reactivity with McAb against platelet glycoproteins is a requirement for diagnosis. More recently the group has defined a type of myeloblastic leukaemia with minimal differentiation, AML-MO, in which myeloid cytochemistry is negative and the diagnosis is made by the expression of myeloid antigens and negative lymphoid markers in the blast cells. However, new problems have emerged with the wider use of McAb which now need to be addressed: the most important is the precise evaluation criteria for biphenotypic leukaemia for which we have proposed a scoring system in order to recognise the genuine cases which constitute a distinct disease entity. The role of karyotyping in the classification of acute leukaemia is gradually being defined (MIC proposals) and some forms of acute leukaemia can only be diagnosed by chromosome translocations, e.g. Ph+ ALL, resulting from t(9;22) and t(4;11) in infant ALL. Several translocations can also be demonstrated by molecular techniques. Cases with t(8;16) (p11;p13) are characterised by myelomonocytic features, erythrophagocytosis and fibrinolysis and represent a type of AML which can be defined primarily by its cytogenetic abnormality.\n",
      "The expression of progenitor cell-associated antigen CD34, defined with monoclonal antibody BI-3C5, was investigated in cells from 109 patients with leukaemia. No reactivity was found in chronic leukaemias, whereas 31% of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and most non-T, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) expressed CD34. Examples of BI-3C5+ AML included M1 and M2 FAB types only; all but one were myeloperoxidase positive. In combination with pan-myeloid markers, BI-3C5 is useful for identification of immature myeloid cells.\n",
      "The progressive availability of more sophisticated technologies has over the last few years allowed a more precise definition of the biological properties of acute leukaemia cells. This, in turn, has enabled to recognize the ontogeny of practically all cases, with particular emphasis to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the lineage affiliation of which had, for many years remained uncertain in over half of the cases. Here, we shall review the main achievements, obtained with extensive immunotyping coupled to the use of probes for the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes, which have led to these important clinico-biological acquisitions, and discuss specific situations in which this combined phenotypic and genotypic approach (as well as response to cloned growth factors) may be of particular value.\n",
      "During a 4-yr period, 292 patients with acute leukaemia were studied using morphology, cytochemistry and immunologic reagents to determine the cell lineage of the leukaemia. One hundred and sixty-three cases were shown to be acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 127 acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and two cases (0.6%) were classified as hybrid acute leukaemias. One was biphenotypic in which the blast cells displayed both T-lymphoid (60% E-rosettes) and megakaryocytic markers (47% CDw41/glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antigen, 50% myeloperoxidase). The second was a bilineal acute leukaemia in which some blast cells displayed B-lymphoid (47% CD10/CALLA, 40% acid phosphatase) features and other megakaryocytic (33% coagulation factor VIII:WVf antigen)/myeloid (30% Sudan Black) features. This study suggests that hybrid acute leukaemia are rare.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Current cancer mortality statistics are important for public health decision-making and resource allocation. Age-standardized rates and numbers of deaths are predicted for 2016 in the European Union (EU). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Population and death certification data for stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, prostate, leukaemias and total cancers were obtained from the World Health Organization database and Eurostat. Figures were derived for the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. Projected numbers of deaths by age group were obtained for 2016 by linear regression on estimated numbers of deaths over the most recent time period identified by a joinpoint regression model. RESULTS: Projected total cancer mortality trends for 2016 in the EU are favourable in both sexes with rates of 133.5/100 000 men and 85.2/100 000 women (8% and 3% falls since 2011) corresponding to 753 600 and 605 900 deaths in men and women for a total number of 1 359 500 projected cancer deaths (+3% compared with 2011, due to population ageing). In men, lung, colorectal and prostate cancer have fallen 11%, 5% and 8%, respectively, since 2011. Breast and colorectal cancer trends in women are favourable (8% and 7% falls, respectively), but lung and pancreatic cancer rates have risen 5% and 4% since 2011 reaching rates of 14.4 and 5.6/100 000 women. Leukaemias show favourable projected mortality for both sexes and all age groups, with stronger falls in the younger age groups. All ages rates are 4.0/100 000 men and 2.5/100 000 women, with falls of 14% and 12% respectively. CONCLUSION: The 2016 predictions for EU cancer mortality confirm the favourable trends in rates particularly for men. Lung cancer is likely to be the leading site for female cancer rates. Continuing falls in mortality, larger in children and young adults, are predicted in leukaemias, essentially due to advancements in management and therapy, and their subsequent adoption across Europe.\n",
      "This article reviews the progress achieved in the field of inducing differentiation in human myeloid leukaemia in vitro and the need for applying this model in leukaemia therapy in vivo. The pre-clinical evaluation of differentiating agents in human myeloid leukaemia is analysed. The clinical experience with differentiation induction therapy in acute myeloid leukaemia is reviewed. This review examines the prospective application of this new form of therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "The transcription factor Wilms' tumour gene 1 (WT1) is important as a prognostic marker as well as in the detection and monitoring of minimal residual disease in leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Evidence has accumulated over the past decade to show that WT1 is a key molecule for tumour proliferation in a large number of human neoplasms most prominent in acute leukaemias, making it a suitable target for therapeutic strategies. Based on animal results, showing safety and efficacy of immunization with WT1 peptides and protein, early clinical trials in leukaemia have recently been initiated. The First International Conference on WT1 in Human Neoplasia was held in Berlin, March 11--12, 2004. This report reviews the current knowledge on the role of WT1 in tumour promotion and as a diagnostic and therapeutic target, and summarizes the data presented and discussed in this meeting.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The acute and chronic leukaemias constitute about 2.5% of all newly diagnosed malignancies and kill over 4000 people/year in the UK, yet there is little accurate up-to-date data on how the incidence of and mortality from leukaemias vary with socio-economic status in the UK. We aimed to quantify the incidence of and mortality from leukaemias in the UK and their variation with gender, age, year of diagnosis as well as socio-economic status. METHODS: All incident cases of leukaemia were identified in 'The Health Improvement Network' (THIN) General Practice dataset. Crude incidence rates and incidence rate ratios (using Poisson Regression) stratified by age, gender, year of diagnosis and socio-economic status were calculated. Median survival and hazard ratios for risk of death (using Cox regression) were then calculated, and stratified in a similar manner. RESULTS: A total of 4162 cases of leukaemia were identified, 2314 (56%) of whom were male. The overall incidence of leukaemia was 11.25 per 100,000 person-years. The age and gender distributions of ALL, AML, CLL and CML were similar to UK cancer registry data. The incidence of leukaemias was independent of socio-economic class. Median survival from leukaemia was 6.58 years and mortality increased with increasing age at diagnosis. The prognosis in AML was dismal and worsened with increasing socio-economic deprivation. For other leukaemias mortality was independent of socio-economic status. CONCLUSION: This is the first general population study to describe the incidence of and mortality from leukaemias in the UK by socio-economic status. Similar mortality across socio-economic gradients in the leukaemias studied suggests equal access to and uptake of services. The exception to this was in AML, where poorer survival in AML patients from lower socio-economic classes may represent a class bias in treatment offered and/or greater co-morbidity in these patients, and warrants further exploration.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of oxidative stress in the pathobiology of lymphoid leukaemias and its involvement in leukaemic relapse. For this purpose the generation of peroxides by mononuclear cells, the erythrocyte activity of superoxide-dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GL-PX), and the plasma levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and vitamin E (VIT E) were determined in 52 patients with two different types of lymphoid leukaemias, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 36 prior to chemotherapy and 16 treated patients. A decrease in SOD and GL-PX activities was observed in ALL patients prior to therapy, while a decrease in GSH and VIT E plasma levels was observed in untreated CLL, as compared to age-matched controls. An increase in peroxides formation occurred in both types of leukaemia, as compared to age-matched controls. There are significant differences for GSH, VIT E and peroxides generation between the different types of leukaemias. In relapsed ALL patients a decrease in peroxides generation was observed which may be due to the increase of the non-enzymatic defences GSH and VIT E. These data suggest the involvement of oxidative stress in acute and chronic lymphoid leukaemias and leukaemic relapse.\n",
      "Blood samples from 118 patients with acute and chronic leukaemia and with more than 50% leukaemic cells were processed with the automated haematology analyser Sysmex NE-8000. For 92 out of these 118 the differences in the histograms and scattergrams of the NE-8000 could be used in an attempt to characterise the leukaemia. This interpretation of the histograms and scattergrams appeared to be highly suggestive of the distinction between lymphatic leukaemia and myeloid leukaemia, and could be indicative of the presence of either the chronic or acute form of both the lymphatic and myeloid leukaemias.\n",
      "The recognition of distinct cytoimmunological subsets of pre-leukaemia and overt AML has been accomplished by morphological, immunological and ultrastructural studies. In many cases, a strong association has been documented between distinctive cytological features and specific chromosome changes. The primary genetic event underlying malignant transformation was also elucidated in a number of acute leukaemias and, as a matter of fact, assessment of these biological parameters has now an established role in the diagnostic work-up and in the monitoring of residual disease. On a more general basis, biological research in MDS is gradually clarifying the fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms of altered cell growth, and differentiation and therapeutic decision making in leukaemia is becoming increasingly dependent on the precise characterization of blast cells. Further refinement of the cytoimmunological classification of acute leukaemias and MDS is warranted in order to provide the physician with an updated framework of reference for the categorization of these heterogeneous haematological disorders and to improve the reproducibility of current morphological diagnosis among different centres (Castoldi et al, 1993).\n",
      "It is suggested that most childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemias and some other paediatric cancers are chemo-curable because they arise in stem cell populations that are functionally transient, chemosensitive and programmed for apoptosis. Most adult acute leukaemias are chemo-incurable at least in part because they originate in relatively drug resistant stem cells with extensive self-renewal capacity. The latter property in turn increases the probability of clones evolving with multi-drug resistance. Particular mutations may superimpose additional adverse features on leukaemic cells.\n",
      "The monoclonal antibodies have had a major role in the recent years' development of the diagnostic methods of acute leukaemia. It was by means of these antibodies that the exact mechanism of the differentiation of the different cell lines could be learned a new therapy- and prognosis-orientated leukaemic classifications could be worked out. With the reasonable application of the monoclonal antibodies in more than 99% of the cases the cell line-age and maturity of the dominant cell type of acute leukaemia may be identified today even in cases of aberrant antigen expression. By means of these antibodies clinical relapse may be forecasted in certain cases and minimal residual disease may be demonstrated as well. The therapeutic systemic application of the monoclonal antibodies has yielded only temporary results but in case of bone marrow transplantation their in vitro application is promising since they are capable of eliminating both the T cells and the residual leukaemic cells of the transplant and, as a result, have a role in the prevention of the development of \"graft versus host\" disease and leukaemic relapse. Monoclonal antibodies are used in acute leukaemia as a routine diagnostic method while their therapeutic application is still at an early stage of investigation.\n",
      "Many studies have shown that epigenetic regulation of ERs (oestrogen receptors) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of leukaemia. In the present study, it was found that the methylated status of ERalpha-A might serve as an epigenetic biomarker of leukaemias. In this study, the protein expression and cell apoptosis, cycle, proliferation and viability with and without 5-aza-dC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) were evaluated with Western blotting, 3H-TdR (3H-thymidine) incorporation, propidium iodide staining and Trypan Blue staining respectively. The protein expression of ERalpha was significantly enhanced in all leukaemic cell lines using treatment with the DNA demethylation reagent 5-aza-dC. However, no obvious change in the protein expression of ERbeta takes place with 5-aza-dC. And with 5-aza-dC, cell apoptosis, cell cycle, cell proliferation and viability were all inhibited significantly. We also tracked 40 cases of leukaemias with ERalpha-A methylation (95%; 38 of 40) to observe the prognosis 1 year after chemotherapy treatment. The patients with ERalpha-A methylation have no obvious symptomatic relief; however, two patients without ERalpha-A methylation have obtained effective relief. This result suggested that ERalpha plays a significant role in leukaemogenesis, and the methylated status of ERalpha-A not only might serve as an epigenetic biomarker of leukaemias for diagnosis, but also has the potential to serve as a predictor of prognosis in leukaemias.\n",
      "Acute leukaemias of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) represent a rare type of leukaemia, expressing both myeloid and lymphoid markers. This study retrospectively analyzed data from 92 children (biphenotypic n = 78, bilineal n = 6, lineage switch n = 8) with ALAL registered in the Berlin-Frankfürt-Münster (BFM) acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) studies between 1998 and 2006 (2.4% of all cases with acute leukaemia). Our cohort of ALAL patients was characterized by comparatively high median age (8.9 years), high median white blood cell count (14.9 x 10(9)/l), as well as frequent hyperleucocytosis (18.5%) and central nervous system involvement (24.1%). The most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities were ETV6/RUNX1 fusion (16%) and trisomy 8 (14.6%). Complete remission rate was significantly lower than in ALL-BFM patients (91.8% vs. 99.1%, P < 0.001), but comparable to AML-BFM patients (87.9%). Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of ALAL patients were low, at 62 +/- 5%. 5-year probability of EFS was significantly worse than in ALL patients (80 +/- 1%, P < 0.001), but better than for AML patients (49 +/- 2%, P = 0.027). Our data suggest that an intensive therapy regimen including stem cell transplantation may be favourable for bilineal or lineage switch cases, whereas patients with ETV6/RUNX1 fusion, lymphoid morphology and patients with expression of cyCD22 and cyCD79a should be treated with an ALL-directed therapy.\n",
      "Of 706 children, 528 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 178 with acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML), whose leukaemia karyotypes could be successfully analysed, 48 were infants less than 1 year of age, 28 with ALL (5% of ALL patients) and 20 with AML (11% of AML patients). In contrast to older children. ALL-leukaemocytogenetics in infants was characterised by lack of hyperdiploidy with over 50 chromosomes and higher incidence of pseudodiploidy. Thirteen (= 46%) infants had an 11q23 aberration, and 11 of them had t(4;11). In AML, nine (= 45%) infants also had an 11q23 abnormality, e.g. t(9;11). Thus, the 11q23 aberration was present in almost 50% of all leukaemia karyotypes of infants. In ALL of infants, the CALLA negative, pre-pre-B immunophenotype prevailed. In AML of infants, the monocytic subtype dominated. A biphenotypic morphology (lymphoid-monocytic) with the expression of lymphoid and myeloid antigens was seen in several ALL and AML cases. In conclusion, leukaemogenesis in infants is a rare event, arising in stem cells of very early hematopoietic differentiation (probably due to gene rearrangement errors, most frequently at FRA11B), and differs from leukaemogenesis in older age groups by unique clinical and cellular features.\n",
      "Immunohistochemistry of acute leukaemias in bone-marrow paraffin sections is commonly thought to be useless because of the poor preservation of many lineage-related markers. The recent development of antibodies against fixative-resistant epitopes and of new antigen retrieval techniques, however, has expanded the possibility of accurately testing routine samples. To assess the relevance of paraffin section phenotyping in lineage determination, 110 examples of acute leukaemia were studied by specific antibodies against CD1a, CD3, CD15, CD20, CD34, CD68, CD79a, TdT, myeloperoxidase, glycophorin A, and factor-VIII-related antigen. The cases included 59 acute myeloid leukaemias, classified according to the FAB cooperative group criteria, 39 precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALLs), seven T-ALLs, and five mixed precursor B-cell/myeloid acute leukaemias. The combination of the markers employed always allowed the identification of the cell lineage (myeloid, lymphoid or mixed) and, in some instances, of phenotypic profiles characteristic of distinct acute leukaemia subtypes. According to the results obtained, bone-marrow biopsy may be regarded as a reliable tool for acute leukaemia diagnosis; this observation is of practical relevance especially for the classification of cases which lack circulating blasts in the peripheral blood or showing dry tap at bone-marrow aspiration.\n",
      "Acute leukaemia of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) is a rare form of leukaemia in which morphologic, cytochemical and immuno-phenotypic features of the proliferating blasts lack sufficient evidence to classify them as myeloid or lymphoid in origin or have characteristics of both myeloid and lymphoid cells. We report a 22-year-old man presenting with clinical features of an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia but blasts in his blood and bone marrow with morphological features of myeloblasts. His immuno-phenotyping by flowcytometry showed antigens specific for both myeloid and B-lymphoid lineages. We highlight the importance of correlating clinical features with cellular morphology when diagnosing acute leukaemias, especially when facilities for flowcytometry are not routinely available.\n",
      "The chronic leukaemias include two distinct chronic neoplastic disease states, namely chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The aim of this study was to assess the utility of leucocyte count, neutrophil percentage and absolute lymphocyte count from differential complete blood count analyses as indicators of the possible presence of CML and CLL. Blood counts from 102 patients with histopathologically confirmed CML and CLL were compared with counts for 858 cancer-free control subjects. Optimal cut-off values were identified by selecting values with the highest sensitivity-specificity combination for each blood count parameter for the two diseases. The results indicated that any individual with mature-appearing lymphocytes at a level > 6.65 x 10(9)/l in the peripheral blood should be examined further for CLL, and that any individual with a leucocyte count > 18.0 x 10(9)/l or a neutrophil proportion > 72.6% should be investigated for CML.\n",
      "Microarray gene expression profiles of fresh clinical samples of chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase, acute promyelocytic leukaemia and acute monocytic leukaemia were compared with profiles from cell lines representing the corresponding types of leukaemia (K562, NB4, HL60). In a hierarchical clustering analysis, all clinical samples clustered separately from the cell lines, regardless of leukaemic subtype. Gene ontology analysis showed that cell lines chiefly overexpressed genes related to macromolecular metabolism, whereas in clinical samples genes related to the immune response were abundantly expressed. These findings must be taken into consideration when conclusions from cell line-based studies are extrapolated to patients.\n",
      "The adult leukaemias are an uncommon but significant group of malignancies. They often present non specifically, but should be suspected on the basis of various clinical findings and the full blood examination. When the diagnosis appears likely, specialist referral is required (especially urgent in the acute leukaemias) to allow confirmation of the diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment.\n",
      "Modern classification systems for acute and chronic leukaemias are based on cytomorphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, immunogenetics and molecular cytogenetics. Morphology forms the initial diagnosis of leukaemia, but generally is not sufficient to identify biologically and clinically relevant subsets within the main categories of leukaemia. Immunophenotyping precisely defines the lineage and stage of differentiation of malignantly transformed haematopoietic cells. This is usually sufficient for precise classification of mature lymphoid malignancies, although immunogenetic and (molecular) cytogenetic studies might be helpful to confirm the diagnosis of disseminated non-Hodgkin lymphomas. However, certain categories of disease that are clearly defined by cytomorphology and immunophenotyping, particularly acute leukaemias, are still heterogeneous, mainly owing to different underlying leukaemogenic events. Immunophenotyping can reveal subgroups highly suggestive of certain chromosome aberrations but reliable identification of such aberrations requires cytogenetic or molecular studies. Such combined diagnostic information forms the basis of current WHO classification of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. This will be complemented in the near future with novel criteria revealed by microarray gene expression profiling. This chapter summarizes and comments on the currently used immunophenotypic classification systems of acute and chronic leukaemias and on the added value of molecular diagnostics.\n",
      "Congenital leukaemia (CL) is a rare malignancy that accounts for < 1% of cases of childhood leukaemias. Leukaemia cutis (LC) refers to cutaneous infiltration with leukaemic cells, and is seen in 30-50% of CL cases. It may precede, follow or occur simultaneously with leukaemia. If left untreated, the prognosis is usually poor, but early diagnosis and treatment may result in a favourable prognosis. We report a case of congenital leukaemia cutis with a progressive, violaceous papulonodular eruption (a 'blueberry muffin' rash), which had been noted at birth, as a presenting sign of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which on investigation was classified as AML, FAB M2 type with a t(8; 21)(p11;q22) chromosomal defect. The patient had a favourable response to AML chemotherapy.\n",
      "The WHO classification that defines subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) is relatively unexplored at the population-based level. This study aimed to examine the frequency of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL or AML-M3) in Brazil. Data were extracted from 239 cancer centres (2001-2012) and categorized according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (CID-O 3.0) and WHO classification (n = 9116). CID-O3 code 9866 identified 614 APL patients. AML not otherwise specified (NOS) was frequent, and the APL group represented the main subtype specified. The mean age of APL was lower than that of other AMLs (31.5, standard deviation (SD) 18.6 versus 40.9, SD 24.6; p < 0.001); there was a high frequency of APL in the 13-21-year-old (11.8 %) and ≤12.9-year-old (6.4 %) age groups. Time taken to begin treatment (as ≤14 days versus >14 days) and induction death rate were lower in APL than in other AML subtypes (p < 0.001). This report provides additional evidence on the distribution of APL among cases of AML in Brazil.\n",
      "Leucocyte suspension viscosity was measured using cells from a number of leukaemias. Samples from individuals with acute myelomonocytic and myeloid leukaemias, and chronic myelogenous and chronic lymphatic leukaemias were examined for their viscosity and flow properties. Leucocytes were suspended in native plasma and the effect of variable leucocyte numbers in the ranges seen in some leukaemias (100-600 x 10(9)/l) examined at different shear stresses. The effect of MCV was also determined in relation to viscosity. The results showed an increasing order of viscosity from the leucocytes of chronic lymphatic leukaemia through chronic myelogenous and acute myeloid leukaemia to the acute myelomonocytic variety. This bears some relation to the mean corpuscular volume, but confirms the fact that at high numbers of cells, patients with acute myelomonocytic, and to a lesser extent the myeloid leukaemias, are at considerable risk of blood hyperviscosity.\n",
      "Acute leukaemia may rarely present as diffuse papules, nodules and plaques forming leonine facies. Leukaemia cutis generally carries a poor prognosis, and responds less well to chemotherapy. We described a case of acute myelomonocytic leukaemia presenting as leonine facies as a result of extensive cutaneous infiltration. The patient did not achieve haematological remission following standard induction chemotherapy and succumbed 6 weeks after the diagnosis was made.\n",
      "Recent experimental evidence suggests that acute myeloid leukaemias may originate from multiple clones of malignant cells. Nevertheless, it is not known how the observed clones may differ with respect to cell properties, such as proliferation and self-renewal. There are scarcely any data on how these cell properties change due to chemotherapy and relapse. We propose a new mathematical model to investigate the impact of cell properties on the multi-clonal composition of leukaemias. Model results imply that enhanced self-renewal may be a key mechanism in the clonal selection process. Simulations suggest that fast proliferating and highly self-renewing cells dominate at primary diagnosis, while relapse following therapy-induced remission is triggered mostly by highly self-renewing but slowly proliferating cells. Comparison of simulation results to patient data demonstrates that the proposed model is consistent with clinically observed dynamics based on a clonal selection process.\n",
      "PCR-based clonality testing can be performed in all lymphoproliferations by analysing gene rearrangements of antigen receptors, rearrangements that are unique for each kind of lymphocyte. Reactive lymphoproliferations have polyclonally rearranged Ig/TCR genes, whereas malignant proliferations (leukaemias and lymphomas) show clonal rearrangements. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical benefits of clonality testing with previously evaluated consensus primers in leukaemia patients. The study included peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 67 leukaemia patients (32 B-CLL, 24 B-ALL and 11 T-ALL). Clonality testing was based on PCR amplification of rearranged IgH and TCR genes. During diagnosis, monoclonal pattern was found in all analysed B-CLL and T-ALL samples. Testing in B-ALL patients showed positive results in all bone marrow and one peripheral blood samples. Results of clonality testing in B-CLL patients during follow-up were concordant between peripheral blood and bone marrow. Obtained results corresponded to clinical course in all but one patient. In B-ALL group, results of molecular testing in peripheral blood and bone marrow confirmed remission estimated according to clinical criteria in all except one patient. Before any clinical sign of relapse, monoclonal pattern was found in six/seven patients by bone marrow and in three/seven patients by peripheral blood analysis, respectively. Results of molecular monitoring in T-ALL patients did not confirme clinical evaluation in two patients. Obtained results indicate high accuracy of re-evaluated primers for clonality assessment in ALL and CLL patients at the time of diagnosis. Results of clonality testing in B-ALL patients indicate that bone marrow analysis has higher sensitivity compared to analysis of peripheral blood.\n",
      "Traditionally, classification of leukaemia in dogs has relied on morphological examination and cytochemical staining patterns, but aberrant cellular morphology and stain uptake often curtails accurate categorization, and historical data based on this classification may be unreliable. Immunophenotyping is now the gold standard for classification of leukaemias. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the clinical pathological and epidemiological features of a population of dogs with morphologically and immunologically confirmed leukaemia and to compare them within categories: acute and chronic lymphoid leukaemia (ALL and CLL), and acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia (AML and CML). There were 64 cases of morphologically and immunologically confirmed leukaemia: 25 cases of ALL, 17 cases of CLL and 22 cases of AML. Prevalence of B and T immunophenotypes in ALL and CLL was not statistically different. Dogs with AML were significantly younger than those with ALL at presentation (P = 0.04). Golden Retriever dogs in the study population were overrepresented in comparison with a control population of dogs (6/25 ALL cases, 8/64 leukaemia cases). No sex was overrepresented. Dogs with ALL had significantly more severe neutropenia (P = 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (P = 0.002) than those with CLL and had significantly more cytopenias. The severity and numbers of cytopenias seen in ALL and AML were not significantly different. Twenty-one of the leukaemia cases showed one cytopenia, fourteen had two cytopenias and twenty-one cases had pancytopenia. Anaemia was the most common cytopenia seen in isolation (17/21). No dogs had neutropenia without anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Total white blood cell counts were not different between the groups. The atypical cell counts within the peripheral blood were significantly higher in ALL than AML; both in isolation and as a percentage of the total white blood cell count (P = 0.03). This study strengthens the hypothesis that acute leukaemias give rise to more profound cytopenias, affecting more cell lines, than chronic leukaemias.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of leukaemias, so the degree of lipid peroxidation was studied as a marker of disease activity in patients of leukaemia. METHODS: Lipid peroxidation product malonyldialdehyde (MDA) was estimated in serum from 30 patients of leukaemia by thio-barbituric acid reaction before and after chemotherapy. There were 10 patients of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 5 with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), 15 with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) of which 10 were in chronic stable phase and 5 in blast crisis. Twenty healthy age and sex matched individuals served as control. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in MDA levels in AML and ALL patients and serum MDA levels were higher in the active phase of disease than in remission. We observed a direct correlation between peripheral leucocyte counts and MDA levels. In CML, MDA levels were higher, more so in the patients who were in blast crisis. Patients of CML blast crisis who achieved remission showed a significant decrease in MDA levels as compared to those without remission. CONCLUSION: We observed a significant increase in MDA levels in active phase of acute as well as chronic leukaemia than those in remission. The proposed mechanism for high MDA is that myeloid cells are a major source of superoxide and other oxygen metabolites which lead to lipid peroxidation. MDA estimation in leukaemia can be of help in detecting type of leukaemia, response of therapy, and to predict the chances of relapse.\n",
      "The pattern of leukaemias in adult Ethiopians admitted to Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion) Hospital, a teaching and referral hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from January 1982 to December 1987 [corrected] is analyzed. There were a total of 7969 medical admissions, of which 180 (2.3%) were for leukaemia. The age range was 14 to 80 years, with a mean of 37.6 years. The male:female ratio was 2.3:1. The commonest type of leukaemia was chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) 57.8%, acute leukaemias and chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) accounted for 21.1% each. Of the acute leukaemias, 53.3% were lymphoblastic (ALL) while 46.7% were acute myeloblastic (AML). Most patients came from Addis Ababa (30.6%) and Shoa (28.9%) regions. The overall incidence of leukaemia in Addis Ababa population was estimated at 1.95 +/- 0.79/100,000/year at 95% confidence interval. The purpose of this study is to attempt a detailed description of leukaemias in Ethiopian patients and compare the findings with similar studies from other countries. Leukaemias are commoner than previously thought, and warrant further study in the community so that management, especially of acute forms, can be improved.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Substantial evidence links exposure to moderate or high doses of ionising radiation, particularly in childhood, with increased risk of leukaemia. The association of leukaemia with exposure to low-dose (<100 mSv) radiation is less certain, although this is the dose range most relevant to the general population. We aimed to estimate the risk of leukaemia associated with low-dose radiation exposure in childhood (age <21 years). METHODS: In this analysis of historical cohort studies, we pooled eligible cohorts reported up to June 30, 2014. We evaluated leukaemia and myeloid malignancy outcomes in these cohorts with the relevant International Classification of Diseases and International Classification of Diseases for Oncology definitions. The cohorts included had not been treated for malignant disease, had reported at least five cases of the relevant haematopoietic neoplasms, and estimated individual active bone marrow (ABM) doses. We restricted analysis to individuals who were younger than 21 years at first irradiation who had mean cumulative ABM doses of less than 100 mSv. Dose-response models were fitted by use of Poisson regression. The data were received in fully anonymised form by the statistical analyst. FINDINGS: We identified nine eligible cohorts from Canada, France, Japan, Sweden, the UK, and the USA, including 262 573 people who had been exposed to less than 100 mSv enrolled between June 4, 1915, and Dec 31, 2004. Mean follow-up was 19·63 years (SD 17·75) and mean cumulative ABM dose was 19·6 mSv (SD 22·7). 154 myeloid malignancies were identified (which included 79 acute myeloid leukaemias, eight myelodysplastic syndromes, and 36 chronic myeloid leukaemias, in addition to other unspecified myeloid malignancies) and 40 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, with 221 leukaemias (including otherwise unclassified leukaemias but excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) identified overall. The fitted relative risks at 100 mSv were 3·09 (95% CI 1·41-5·92; ptrend=0·008) for acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes combined, 2·56 (1·09-5·06; ptrend=0·033) for acute myeloid leukaemia, and 5·66 (1·35-19·71; ptrend=0·023) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. There was no clear dose-response for chronic myeloid leukaemia, which had a relative risk at 100 mSv of 0·36 (0·00-2·36; ptrend=0·394). There were few indications of between-cohort heterogeneity or departure from linearity. For acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes combined and for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the dose-responses remained significant for doses of less than 50 mSv. Excess absolute risks at 100 mSv were in the range of 0·1-0·4 cases or deaths per 10 000 person-years. INTERPRETATION: The risks of acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were significantly increased after cumulative doses of ionising radiation of less than 100 mSv in childhood or adolescence, with an excess risk also apparent for cumulative radiation doses of less than 50 mSv for some endpoints. These findings support an increased risk of leukaemia associated with low-dose exposure to radiation and imply that the current system of radiological protection is prudent and not overly protective.

      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate long-term health effects in AS patients treated with (224)Ra. METHODS: A prospective epidemiological study has been carried out on 1471 AS patients treated with repeated intravenous injections of (224)Ra between 1948 and 1975. These patients have been followed together with a control group of 1324 AS patients not treated with radioactive drugs and/or X-rays. Numbers of malignancies expected in a normal population were computed from German and Danish cancer registry data. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up time of 26 yrs in the exposed group or 25 yrs in the control group, causes of death have been ascertained for 1006 exposed patients and 1072 controls. In particular, 19 cases of leukaemia were observed in the exposure group (vs 6.8 cases expected, P < 0.001) compared to 12 cases of leukaemia in the control group (vs 7.5 cases expected). Further subclassification of the leukaemia cases demonstrated a high increase of myeloid leukaemia in the exposure group (11 cases observed vs 2.9 cases expected, P < 0.001), especially a high excess of acute myeloid leukaemias (7 cases observed vs 1.8 cases expected, P = 0.003), whereas in the controls the observed cases are within the expected range (4 myeloid leukaemias vs 3.1 cases expected). CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced leukaemia incidence in the exposed group is in line with results from experiments in mice injected with varying amounts of the bone-seeking alpha-emitter (224)Ra. In these studies, in animals exposed to lower doses of (224)Ra, i.e. at doses lower than those found to induce osteosarcomas, an increased risk of leukaemia was observed.\n",
      "The incidence of acute biphenotypic leukaemia has ranged from less than 1% to almost 50% in various reports in the literature. This wide variability may be attributed to a number of reasons including lack of consistent diagnostic criteria, use of various panels of antibodies, and the failure to recognize the lack of lineage specificity of some of the antibodies used. The morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotype and cytogenetics of acute biphenotypic leukaemias from our institution were studied. The diagnostic criteria took into consideration the morphology of the analysed cells, light scatter characteristics, and evaluation of antibody fluorescence histograms in determining whether the aberrant marker expression was arising from leukaemic blasts or differentiated bone marrow elements. Fifty-two of 746 cases (7%) fulfilled our criteria for acute biphenotypic leukaemias. These included 30 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) expressing myeloid antigens, 21 cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) expressing lymphoid markers, and one case of ALL expressing both B- and T-cell associated antigens. The acute biphenotypic leukaemia cases consisted of four major immunophenotypic subgroups: CD2+ AML (11), CD19+ AML (8), CD13 and/or CD33+ ALL (24), CD11b+ ALL (5) and others (4). Chromosomal analysis was carried out in 42/52 of the acute biphenotypic leukaemia cases; a clonal abnormality was found in 31 of these 42 cases. This study highlights the problems encountered in the diagnosis of acute biphenotypic leukaemia, some of which may be responsible for the wide variation in the reported incidence of this leukaemia. We suggest that the use of strict, uniform diagnostic criteria may help in establishing a more consistent approach towards diagnosis of this leukaemic entity. We also suggest that biphenotypic leukaemia is comprised of biologically different groups of leukaemia based on immunophenotypic and cytogenetic findings.\n",
      "Rearrangements of delta-, tau-, and beta- T-cell receptor (TcR) chain genes were analysed in 64 haematologic malignancies comprising T- and B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL), B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLL), acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and acute undifferentiated leukaemias AUL). The TcR genes were rearranged in 5/6 T-ALL. In non-T-leukaemias the frequency of TcR gene rearrangements was higher in B-lineage ALL (8/11), although they were all detected in B-CLL (5/29), AML (1/16) and AUL (2/4). Immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements were observed in 1/6 T-ALL and 2/14 AML. The analysis of these gene configurations has a diagnostic application since it allows the definition of the clonality of malignant proliferation and although they are not lineage specific such configurations represent a further parameter to evaluate, together with the immunophenotype and morphology, in the assignment or exclusion of the differentiation lineage of the haematologic malignancies.\n",
      "The relation between leukaemia and smoking habits was examined in data from the veterans' smoking study, a prospective study of mortality among 248,000 United States veterans, of whom 723 died of leukaemia during 1954-69. A significant increase in mortality from leukaemia among cigarette smokers (relative risk 1.53) was found, together with a dose-response relation with amount smoked (trend p less than 0.001). The relation was strongest (relative risk 1.72) for monocytic and chronic and unspecified myeloid leukaemias (ICD (7th revision) codes 204.1 and 204.2). For these leukaemias the increase was almost twofold (relative risk 1.93) among current smokers of over 20 cigarettes daily. Ex-cigarette smokers also showed an increase of leukaemia (relative risk 1.39; p less than 0.001). These findings are consistent with other studies and relevant to the interpretation of minor increases of leukaemia both in population and in individual based studies. If causal they also imply that smoking is responsible for many more deaths from leukaemia in adults than all other known causes combined.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Hyperleukocytic leukaemias are associated with early mortality due to respiratory or neurological complications. They result from endothelial damage secondary to leukostasis. Leukapheresis, which aims to lower the white blood cell (WBC) count, has been used in certain patients to reduce the threat from leukostasis. However, there are very few published clinical investigations on the most appropriate use of leukapheresis in hyperleukocytosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 14 patients with hyperleukocytic leukaemia who presented to our institution and underwent therapeutic leukapheresis. We compare their clinical and biological characteristics and investigate the impact of leukapheresis on early mortality and long-term prognosis. RESULTS: The median presenting WBC count was 439 x 10(3)/mm(3). Although patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) had the lowest median presenting WBC counts, they constituted the largest group of patients with symptomatic hyperleukocytosis. Leukapheresis was highly effective, with the mean absolute and percentage reduction in WBC after each cycle being 126 x 10(3)/mm(3) and 31.9% respectively. Four patients with AML died within 2 weeks of presentation despite prompt and effective leukapheresis. CONCLUSION: The interaction between the leukaemic cells and the vascular environment, a mechanism that none of the current therapies directly address, is probably more important in causing leukostasis than the absolute cell count itself.\n",
      "We have developed a microarray (DotScan) that enables rapid immunophenotyping and classification of leukaemias and lymphomas by measuring the capture of cells by immobilized dots of 82 CD antibodies [Belov, L., de la Vega, O., dos Remedios, C.G., Mulligan, S.P., 2001. Immunophenotyping of leukemia using a cluster of differentiation antibody microarray. Cancer Res. 61, 4483; Belov, L., Huang, P., Barber, N., Mulligan, S.P., Christopherson, R.I., 2003. Identification of repertoires of surface antigens on leukemias using an antibody microarray. Proteomics 3, 2147]. The DotScan technology has been used to investigate the properties of 498 new antibodies submitted to the HLDA8 Workshop. These antibodies have been applied as 10 nl dots to a film of nitrocellulose on a microscope slide to make an HLDA8 microarray. After blocking the remaining nitrocellulose surface, individual arrays were incubated with each of 7 cell types from a human leukaemia cell panel consisting of three cell lines, CCRF-CEM (a T-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia), MEC-1 (derived from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) and HL-60 (a promyelocytic leukaemia), and four leukaemias from patients: a T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and two acute myeloid leukaemias. Leukaemia cells were captured by those immobilized antibodies for which they expressed the corresponding surface molecule. Unbound cells were gently washed off, bound cells were fixed to the arrays and dot patterns were recorded using a DotScan array reader and quantified using DotScan data analysis software. The data obtained show the unique expression profiles of the 7 cell types in the leukaemia cell panel obtained with the DotScan microarray, and the differential capture patterns for these 7 cell types screened against the 498 antibodies in the HLDA8 microarray constructed for this study.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Acute erythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias are associated with very poor prognoses and the mechanism of blastic transformation is insufficiently elucidated. The murine Graffi leukaemia retrovirus induces erythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias when inoculated into NFS mice and represents a good model to study these leukaemias. METHODS: To expand our understanding of genes specific to these leukaemias, we compared gene expression profiles, measured by microarray and RT-PCR, of all leukaemia types induced by this virus. RESULTS: The transcriptome level changes, present between the different leukaemias, led to the identification of specific cancerous signatures. We reported numerous genes that may be potential oncogenes, may have a function related to erythropoiesis or megakaryopoiesis or have a poorly elucidated physiological role. The expression pattern of these genes has been further tested by RT-PCR in different samples, in a Friend erythroleukaemic model and in human leukaemic cell lines.We also screened the megakaryoblastic leukaemias for viral integrations and identified genes targeted by these integrations and potentially implicated in the onset of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Taken as a whole, the data obtained from this global gene profiling experiment have provided a detailed characterization of Graffi virus induced erythro- and megakaryoblastic leukaemias with many genes reported specific to the transcriptome of these leukaemias for the first time.\n",
      "A total of 293 cases of various types of leukaemia admitted in Central Hospital (Riyadh) were studied from January 1981 to December 1988. The incidence of leukaemia was worked out to be 0.13% of the total hospital population during this period. Acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) group was the most frequent (37.54%), followed by acute lymphocytic leukaemia (24.23%) followed by chronic myeloid leukaemia [corrected] (19.11%), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) group (18.77%) and lymphosarcoma cell leukaemia (LSCL) (0.35%). Acute leukaemias were further classified into subtypes on the basis of FAB (French-American-British) classification. In ANLL or AML group, the pattern was M2 greater than M4 greater than M3 greater than M6 greater than M1 greater than M5. In ALL group, the pattern was L2 greater than L1 greater than L3. Among FAB subtypes of acute leukaemias, the pattern was L2 greater than M2 greater than M4 greater than M3 greater than M6 greater than M1 and L1 greater than L3 greater than M5. The age range of these patients was 5 years to 80 years; only 9 cases were less than 11 years of age. In childhood and young adults, acute leukaemias (ALL and AML) were the commonest types (particularly ALL was common in childhood), whereas CML was common in adults and CLL in old age. Males dominated the females in all the types of leukaemia (male to female ratio was 2.4:1). Out of 293 leukaemia cases, 149 (51.0%) were Saudi Arabs, the rest were expatriates. AML was found to be the most common type in central, western and southern Saudi Arabia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "The electrochemical voltammetric behavior of bone marrow of leukaemia has been investigated by a self-devised cytosensing system. The two anodic peaks of erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBC) in bone marrow of leukaemia appeared at 0.73 +/- 0.03 and 0.83 +/- 0.02V vs. SCE, respectively, on the first scan. The anodic peak of leukocytes (white blood cells, WBC) appeared at 0.32 +/- 0.03V vs. SCE. The anodic peak of RBC at 0.83V disappeared when the patients were cured. The experimental results show that the voltammetric behavior of erythrocytes is in constant contact with the initial stage of leukaemia. The cyclic voltammetric behavior of 40 cases of leukaemia including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and 10 cases of healthy volunteer peripheral blood was studied. The cyclic voltammetric behavior of erythrocytes may provide a simple and specific marker for diagnosis of leukaemia.\n",
      "Acute leukaemia is a consequence of malignant transformation of a haematopoetic progenitor cell. Molecular studies have revealed a prenatal origin of many childhood leukaemias. According to current models, a preleukaemic stem cell clone is generated by a first mutation in utero which, in a minority of children, progresses to leukaemia after receiving further postnatal genetic hits. The nature of pre- and postnatal events involved in leukaemogenesis in children is not well understood. Although genetic predisposition and specific environmental exposures may account for individual cases, the bulk of childhood leukaemia cannot be explained by any of these factors. The higher incidence of the most common leukaemia subtype in affluent societies, as well as the age peak between 2-5 y, suggest a contributory role of socioeconomic factors. An abnormal immune response during delayed exposure to common infections provides a plausible mechanism for malignant progression of preleukaemic clones in a subgroup of children. As highlighted in this review, a common cause for all types and subtypes of childhood leukaemia is highly unlikely. Deeper insights into the pathogenesis of childhood leukaemia will rely on large-scale and combined epidemiological and biomolecular studies.\n",
      "Leukaemias constitute approximately one-third of cancers in children (age 0-14 years) and 10% in adolescents (age 15-19 years). Geographical patterns (1988-1997) and time trends (1978-1997) of incidence and survival from leukaemias in children (n=29,239) and adolescents (n=1929) were derived from the ACCIS database, including data from 62 cancer registries in 19 countries across Europe. The overall incidence rate of leukaemia in children was 44 per million person-years during 1988-1997. Lymphoid leukaemia (LL) accounted for 81%, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) for 15%, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) for 1.5% and unspecified leukaemia for 1.3% of cases. Adjusted for sex and age, incidence of childhood LL was significantly lower in the East and higher in the North than in the British Isles. The overall incidence among adolescents was 22.6 per million person-years. The incidence of LL was rising in children (0.6% per year) and adolescents (1.9% per year). During 1988-1997 5-year survival of children with leukaemias was 73% (95% CI 72-74) and approximately 44% for infants and adolescents. Similar differences in survival between children and adolescents were observed for LL, much less so for ANLL. Survival differed between regions; prognosis was better in the North and West than the East. Remarkable improvements in survival occurred in most of the subgroups of patients defined by diagnostic subgroup, age, sex and geographic categories during the period 1978-1997. For children with ANLL most improvements in survival were observed in the 1990s.\n",
      "Registrations from the New Zealand Cancer Registry were used to examine time trends in the incidence of leukaemias among children aged 0-14. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of leukaemia among children aged 0-4 during 1953-57 to 1988-90. In this age group, the recorded incidence rate increased from 4.89 per 100,000 person-years in 1953-57 to 7.92 in 1988-90. During 1973-77 to 1988-90 (and probably in earlier years), the increase was due to an increase in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The trends were unlikely to be due to changes in diagnosis or case ascertainment. The childhood leukaemia trends might be related to trends in family size, maternal age, socioeconomic level or exposure to infections. However, there are uncertainties about the importance of these factors or about their trends. The incidence of acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) decreased between 1968-72 and 1988-90. The time trends highlight the likely importance of environmental factors in the aetiology of childhood leukaemias in New Zealand. The risk of ALL was lower in the Maori than in the non-Maori population (relative risk Maori/non-Maori 0.74). The risk of ANLL was higher among Maori (relative risk 1.84).\n",
      "The 10 coding exons of the WT1 gene, from 39 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon to 12 bp downstream of the stop codon, were examined for point mutations in a panel of 48 sporadic childhood acute leukaemias using the single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) assay. The panel included 33 cases of acute lymphocytic leukaemia and 15 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia. This is the first study in which sporadic childhood leukaemias have been examined for WT1 point mutations across the entire coding region of the WT1 gene, however, no tumorigenic point mutations or small deletions or insertions could be identified in these patients. A previously described polymorphism in exon 7, resulting in an A to G transition in an arginine codon, was observed at a frequency of 21.5%, equivalent to that seen in the normal population. This study suggests that point mutations in the coding regions of the WT1 occur infrequently in leukaemias of childhood.\n",
      "To assess the role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in acute leukaemias, we retrospectively compared 25 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or acute myelogenous leukaemia after RIC to a historical group of 50 matched controls after high-dose conditioning. Engraftment, acute GvHD and severe infections were comparable in both groups. During the observation period, 1/25 patients (4%) after RIC and 14/50 (28%) after standard SCT died due to transplant-related causes; cumulative nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 4% after RIC and 24% after standard SCT (P=0.029). In total, 15/25 patients (60%) relapsed after RIC and 20/50 (40%) after standard SCT; probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years was 43% after RIC and 49% after standard SCT (NS). Overall survival (OS) was 40% after RIC and 37% after standard SCT (NS). Stage of disease, cytogenetic risk profile, acute and chronic GvHD, chimerism status at day 90 and severe infections after transplantation were risk factors with significant impact on DFS and/or OS. In retrospective analysis, patients with acute leukaemias who receive RIC because of contraindications against standard SCT have a comparable outcome to standard SCT, but the higher relapse rate warrants further studies.\n",
      "Clonal chromosomal abnormalities such as balanced translocations are characteristic features of several human leukaemias and have long been detected by conventional cytogenetics on banded metaphases. The advent of molecular biology techniques, advanced karyotyping and immunohistochemistry methods has not only allowed identification of gene involvement at altered chromosome sites and better knowledge of leukaemia pathogenesis, but also contributed important improvements in diagnosis of these heterogeneous diseases. Such novel diagnostic strategies are nowadays being increasingly used to improve leukaemia classification, and in several instances, they help to establish the most appropriate therapeutic strategy in individual patients. Moreover, at least two leukaemia-associated fusion proteins derived from chromosome translocation are specifically targeted by therapeutic approaches which result in significantly increased anti-leukaemia efficacy and reduced toxicity. In this chapter, we highlight the importance of identifying these genetic lesions at diagnosis in acute leukaemia. Further, we discuss briefly the clinical utility of detecting these alterations for prognostic assessment and evaluation of response to treatment.\n",
      "A wide panel of commercially available monoclonal antibodies (Mo.Abs.) has substantially improved immunological distinguishing of various types of acute leukaemias (AL), whereas the flow-cytometric approach allows a more objective and sensitive cell-marker analysis; combined with high numbers of cells analyzed, it yields data of high statistical significance. In addition, multiparameter analysis offers the possibility of studying heterogenous cell populations. Both technical advancements were used to study the expression of leukocyte differentiation antigens in 90 adult patients with AL. With the panel of Mo.Abs. used, the diagnosis was unequivocally established in 90% of cases; four of them (4.4% of the total) expressed unusual (mixed) phenotype. When combined with cytological/cytochemical data, the diagnosis was established in 95.6% of cases, whereas 4.4% of all cases remained unclassified.\n",
      "In a population-based case-control study among adults in Italy, of 261 lymphoid and 313 myeloid leukaemias and 1718 controls, a later age at adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy (after age 10 years) increased considerably the risk of lymphocytic (but not myeloid) leukaemia (odds ratio 4.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1-16.2). We propose that late infection is a proliferative stimulus for B-cells.\n",
      "The pattern of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements was determined in 87 patients with acute and chronic leukaemias and myelodysplastic syndromes by Southern blot hybridisation. All 31 cases of common, B cell and null cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia showed Ig heavy chain (JH) rearrangement, and TCR (beta-chain) rearrangement was seen in all 5 cases of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Inappropriate JH and TCR (beta) rearrangements were present in some cases of T-ALL (60%) and common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (18%), respectively. For the 19 patients with acute leukaemias following chronic myeloid leukaemia, blastic transformation, all 4 with lymphoid transformation and 3 of the 15 with myeloid transformation had JH rearrangement, and 3 CD10-positive lymphoid transformation and 2 myeloid transformation had their TCR (beta) genes rearranged. In conclusion, the pattern of Ig and TCR gene rearrangements correlated well with the cell lineage. However, cross-lineage rearrangements were more commonly seen in patients with acute leukaemias following chronic myeloid leukaemia blastic transformation, as compared to the de novo cases.\n",
      "The age-sex distributions and temporal trends in incidence of leukaemia and lymphoma from the Manchester Children Tumour Registry (MCTR), 1954-1998, are reported. This 45-year study includes 1795 children, all of whom had a histologically and/or cytologically verified leukaemia or lymphoma. At the time of their diagnoses all the children were under 15 years of age and were resident in a geographically defined area of northwest England covered by the MCTR. Log-linear modelling identified significant linear increases in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (average annual increase 0.7%; P= 0.005) and in Hodgkin disease (HD) (1.2%, P=0.04), but not in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), nor in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The increase in ALL was most pronounced amongst males, aged 1-4 years, and is likely to be due to precursor B-cell leukaemias. The increases in ALL and HD are discussed in relation to current hypotheses suggesting a role for infection. Additionally, a non-linear cohort effect was identified for NHL (P= 0.008), which may indicate the involvement of environmental factors other than infection.\n",
      "A retrospective study of 45 patients of acute leukaemia in children (15 years age), in relation to FAB classification, is presented. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL) were commoner than acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), with an ALL:AML ratio of 4.63:1. Amongst ALL, L1 was the most frequent type (59%), followed by L2 (35%) and L3 (5.4%), respectively. FAB types M2, M3, M4 and M5 were diagnosed in 2 patients each. An analysis of clinical features in relation to FAB classification is also presented.\n",
      "We conducted a case-control study to investigate the role of early infections in the aetiology of childhood acute leukaemias. The study included 280 incident cases (240 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 40 acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia) and 288 hospital controls, frequency matched by age, gender, hospital, catchment area of the hospital and ethnic origin. Data were obtained from standardised face-to-face interviews of the mothers. The interviews included questions on early common infections, day-care attendance, breast-feeding, birth order and infantile diseases. Odds ratios were estimated using an unconditional regression model including the stratification variables, parental socio-economic status and perinatal characteristics. Birth order was not associated with childhood leukaemia (acute lymphoblastic or acute non-lymphoblastic). A statistically-significant inverse association was observed between childhood leukaemia and day-care attendance (odds ratio=0.6, 95% Confidence Interval=(0.4-1.0)), repeated early common infections (> or = 4 per year before age two, odds ratio=0.6 (0.4-1.0)), surgical procedures for ear-nose-throat infections before age two (odds ratio=0.5 (0.2-1.0)) and prolonged breast-feeding (> or = 6 months, odds ratio=0.5 (0.2-1.0)). In the multivariate model including day-care attendance, early common infections and breast-feeding, results concerning breast-feeding remained unchanged. A statistically significant interaction between day-care attendance and repeated early common infections was observed. When the interaction was taken into account, the simple effects of day-care and early common infections disappeared (odds ratio=1.1 (0.5-2.3) and odds ratio=0.8 (0.5-1.3), respectively) while the joint effect of day-care attendance and early common infections was negatively associated with childhood leukaemia (odds ratio=0.3 (0.1-0.8)). All the above associations were observed both for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia. Our results support Greaves' hypothesis, even though they are not specific of common leukaemia.\n",
      "Previous studies of space-time clustering in childhood leukaemia have produced equivocal and inconsistent results. To address this issue we have used Manchester Children Tumour Registry leukaemia data in space-time clustering analyses. Knox tests for space-time interactions between cases were applied with fixed thresholds of close in space, <5 km and close in time <1 year apart. Addresses at birth as well as diagnosis were utilized. Tests were repeated replacing geographical distance with distance to the Nth nearest neighbour. N was chosen such that the mean distance was 5 km. Data were also examined by a second order procedure based on K-functions. All methods showed highly significant evidence of space-time clustering based on place of birth and time of diagnosis, particularly for all leukaemias aged 0-14 and 0-4 years, and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 0-4 years. Some results based on location at diagnosis were significant but mainly gave larger P-values. The results are consistent with an infectious hypothesis. Furthermore, we found an excess of male cases over females involved in space-time pairs. We suggest this may be related to genetic differences in susceptibility to infection between males and females. These findings provide the basis for future studies to identify possible infectious agents.\n",
      "The Ikaros gene is an essential regulator in development and haematopoiesis. Dysregulated Ikaros gene expression participates in leukaemic processes, as evidenced in animal models, and by analyses of blast-cell populations from leukaemic patients. We used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to evaluate the relative abundance of several Ikaros transcript isoforms in a variety of leukaemic-cell samples. Total RNA was isolated from bone-marrow or blood-cell samples collected at diagnosis in children or adult patients, 18 of whom had acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), 61 of whom had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 11 of whom had chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The ratio (Ik1 + Ik2)/(Ik1 + Ik2 + Ik4 + Ik7 + Ik8) ranged from 13.5% to 85% and was lower (P < 0. 05) in samples from patients with m-bcr-abl ALL. An alternative splicing resulting in the deletion of 30 nucleotides at the end of exon 6 was observed in leukaemic samples, and in normal thymus and bone marrow. Our results are consistent with previous reports and suggest that the pattern of expression of the different human Ikaros isoforms are not homogeneous among different subsets of leukaemias.\n",
      "We report data on 110 children aged <15 years diagnosed with leukaemia during two periods covering 13.25 years. The data sets were consistent. The reported incidence of leukaemia was low. Only 34 (31%) of the children were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) compared with 54 (49%) children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The overall mean (SD) age was 6.6 (3.5) years, 6.1 (3.5) for ALL and 6.9 (3.5) for AML. There was no evidence of an early childhood peak of ALL. The male : female ratio was 1.2 : 1 for all leukaemias, 1.3 for ALL and 1.25 for AML. Only eight (22%) of those diagnosed with ALL were classified as type L1. Our figures reflect a relative absence of the common (cALL) cell type in early childhood leukaemia and support the role of infection and its effect on the immune system in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. Our data also revealed an unusually high proportion of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).\n",
      "Although it has been known for more than 40 years that allogeneic immune responses cure leukaemias after bone marrow transplantation, autologous leukaemia-specific immunity remains controversial and its impact upon survival has not been established. Here we have tested 25 patients with de novo acute leukaemias, while in remission at completion of their anti-leukaemia therapy, for evidence of autologous cytolytic immunity to their leukaemic cells taken and cryopreserved at disease presentation. We have measured this degree of cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro and termed it \"leukaemia cytolytic activity\" (LCA). Patients whose disease ultimately relapsed had significantly lower LCA than those who remained in remission beyond 2 years (P < 0.001); the absence of LCA when in remission predicted subsequent relapse within 2 years with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 77%. LCA was mediated in vitro by CD56+/CD8alpha+/CD3- natural killer cells. We propose that it is this immune response, rather than the chemotherapy per se, which is responsible for continued remission and that measurement of LCA in patients at completion of therapy may be used as an indicator of risk of subsequent relapse. Patients lacking this response will require further treatment, either with an allogeneic donor transplant or an alternative immunotherapeutic strategy.\n",
      "STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were (1) to test for uniformity of distribution of childhood leukaemias and other malignancies; and (2) to consider the aetiological implications of unusual distributions. DESIGN: A test for spacial clustering was applied using a method which allows for unequal distribution of the population at risk and avoids using census data to provide population denominators. When clustering was identified, four possible aetiological links which had already been suggested to the Leukaemia Research Fund Centre were examined in a local area. SETTING: The study was carried out in the Yorkshire Health Region in the north of England. PATIENTS: 144 children under 15 years of age with a diagnosis of malignant disease known to the Yorkshire Regional Childhood Tumour Registry between 1974 and 1986 were included in the analysis. Of these 53 had leukaemias and nine had lymphomas. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Significant localised clustering was found in North Humberside, though not in the whole of the Yorkshire Health Region. A number of clustered cases were identified, some of whom were in a post code sector, Hull 10, to the west of Kingston-upon-Hull, about which concern had been expressed since 1985. There was however no evidence that disease clustering was confined to this area. Four previously suggested hypotheses about causation in this particular area were examined but the results were negative or inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of spacial clustering must be seen as only the first step in a series of investigations; it can only rarely lead to aetiological conclusions by itself, but it can motivate and target other investigations.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the hypothesis that children of men whose jobs involve contact with many people (particularly children) are at an increased risk of leukaemia. METHODS: A population based dataset obtained from routinely collected death certificates involving 14,168 cancer deaths occurring before the age of 15 years registered in England and Wales between 1959-63 and 1970-90. Associations were assessed with the proportional cancer mortality ratio (PCMR), with all childhood cancer deaths forming the standard for comparison. The PCMRs were adjusted, by stratification, for age and year of death (in 1-year bands) and paternal social class (nine categories). Analyses were performed by estimated level of paternal occupational social contact (high, medium, and low) for all leukaemias, leukaemia subtype, age at death, year of death, and individual occupation. RESULTS: Out of 223 occupations, 36 (16%) were identified as having potentially high levels of social contact, and 27 (12%) as having potentially medium levels of social contact. No associations were found between paternal occupational social contact and death during childhood from leukaemia (high social contact: PCMR 94, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 87 to 102; medium social contact: 101, 95 to 106). No associations were found when the data were analysed by leukaemia subtype, age at death, year of death, or individual occupation. CONCLUSION: The findings presented here do not support the suggestion that childhood leukaemia is related to the amount of social contact that fathers experience at work.\n",
      "Many investigators have studied the effects of Extremely Low Frequency-Magnetic Fields generated by ordinary and domestic power lines, as a risk factor in acute leukaemias of children, but there are limited information available regarding very high voltage overhead power lines. Children in developing countries sometimes live very close to such structures and we have registered several patients with acute leukaemias appearing in clusters. In the present study we have analyzed 60 consecutively diagnosed patients with acute leukaemias, and 59 matched controls in a provincial capital city in North-Western Iran. After provision of consent, a detailed form was filled in, and a visit to the present (or previous) residential areas of both groups was arranged. The locations of the very high voltage power lines (123, 230, 400 kilo volts), were noted in each area, if present, and their distances from the houses under study were detected. The expected intensities of the Magnetic Fields (B) were calculated having the mean intensity of the electrical current and other line characteristics, by means of relevant equations. Fourteen patients in the case group (23.5%) were living near the high voltage power lines in distances < or = 500 meters. (Mean B = 0.6 microTeslas, microT). In the control group at the same distance, the figure was 2 children (3.3%) (Mean B = 0.35 microT). Statistically, the likelihood of leukaemia was increased considerably in this distance (Odds ratio (OR) = 8.67, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.74- 58.4, P value= 0.001). On the other hand 15 pts (25 %) in the leukaemia group were experiencing Magnetic fields above 0.45 microT in comparison to 5 in the control group ( 8.5% )(OR = 3.60, 95% CI = 1.11-12.39, P = 0.01). More children in developing countries like Iran live close to very high voltage lines, and they experience relatively more harmful effects from the Magnetic Fields, in comparison with children in developed countries. Residence near very high voltage overhead power lines, in distances < or = 500 meters, and Magnetic Fields >0.45 microT, should be considered a risk factor for the pathogenesis of acute leukaemias in children.\n",
      "In order to explore potential risk factors of childhood leukaemia, a case control study was performed including all incident cases from 1992 to 1994. The study was based on the German Childhood Cancer Registry. It was restricted to cases from West Germany and extended retrospectively until 1980 for children who were living in regions covered by a previous incidence study on nuclear installations (21). The study was conducted in close correspondence with a preceding case control study in Lower Saxony (13). Results of this study and of others published in the literature were used to define explicit hypotheses for the present study. This paper presents the methodology of the study and gives an overview of some basic results. More detailed analyses of the investigated potential risk factors will be published elsewhere. The study comprised a total of 2358 cases (leukaemias, lymphomas, selected tumours) and 2588 controls. Response rates were 81% for cases and 67% for controls. For leukaemias, the main results regarding maternal factors, pregnancy, birth, immune system, ionising radiation, parental occupation and environmental factors were as follows: Positive associations were observed between childhood leukaemias and young maternal age at birth, high birth weight, tonsillectomy and use of pesticides. Some results suggest a protective effect for allergies and vaccinations. A negative association was observed with maternal smoking and childhood leukaemia. No associations were found with frequency of stillbirths, maternal alcohol consumption, parental exposure to benzene and use of wood preservatives. X-ray examinations in early childhood and parental radiation exposure did not show any consistent associations with leukaemia. Potential risk factors were not reported more frequently by cases and controls living in 114 communities with increased incidence rates. The strength of our study lies in the large number of participating families and in the population-based approach.\n",
      "In a variety of adult and childhood leukaemia cell samples collected at different states of the disease, we analysed in a series of sequentially performed slot-blot or Northern-blot hybridisation experiments the expression of genes possibly involved in multiple drug resistance (MDR) (mdr1/P-glycoprotein, DNA topoisomerase II, glutathione-S-transferase pi), and the expression of the DNA topoisomerase I and histone 3.1 genes. Occasionally, P-glycoprotein gene expression was additionally examined by indirect immunocytofluorescence using the monoclonal antibody C219. No significant difference in mdr1/P-glycoprotein mRNA levels between primary and relapsed state acute lymphocytic leukaemias (ALL) was seen on average. Second or third relapses, however, showed a distinct tendency to an elevated expression of this multidrug transporter gene (up to 10-fold) in part well beyond the value seen in the moderately cross-resistant T-lymphoblastoid CCRF-CEM subline CCRF VCR 100. Increased mdr1/P-glycoprotein mRNA levels were also found in relapsed state acute myelogenous leukaemias (AML), and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLL) treated with chlorambucil and/or prednisone for several years. Topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II mRNA levels were found to be very variable. Whereas in all but one case of CLL topoisomerase II mRNA was not detected by slot-blot hybridizations, strong topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II gene expression levels, frequently exceeding the levels monitored in the CCRF-CEM cell line, were seen in many cell samples of acute leukaemia. If topoisomerase II mRNA was undetectable, expression of topoisomerase I was clearly visible throughout. These observations might be valuable considering the possible treatment with specific topoisomerase I or topoisomerase II inhibitors. Significant positive correlations were found (i) for topoisomerase I and histone 3.1 gene expression levels in general (P less than 0.001), and (ii) in the CLL samples additionally for the expression levels of the mdr1 gene, and the histone 3.1, topoisomerase I, and glutathione-S-transferase pi genes, respectively.\n",
      "The clinical significance of surface markers was investigated in 145 cases of acute myeloid (AML) or undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL), using a panel of six monoclonal antibodies directed to NHL-30.5 antigen (expressed on poorly differentiated myeloid cells), CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33 and CD34 antigens. Expression of CD14 was correlated with higher leucocyte count, higher serum lactate dehydrogenase level and presentation with extramedullary disease. There was no strict correlation with the French-American-British classification. However, the expression of CD14 was associated with monocytic subtypes. CD15 was mainly expressed in M2 and M3 subtypes, and NHL-30.5 and CD34 antigens in AUL and M1 leukaemias. All patients were treated with the same intensive induction treatment. Staining by three antibodies had a prognostic value. The complete remission (CR) rates were 38% (26/68) in NHL-30.5-positive versus 75% (62/77) in NHL-30.5-negative cases (P less than 10(-5), 50% (37/74) in CD34-positive versus 72% (51/71) in CD34-negative cases (P = 0.007) and 70% (77/110) in CD15-positive versus 31% (11/35) in CD15-negative cases (P less than 10(-4). Expression of NHL-30.5 and CD34 antigen was associated with shorter survival (P less than 10(-3) and P less than 10(-2) respectively), whereas survival was longer in CD15-positive cases (P less than 10(-3). In multivariate analysis, expression of NHL-30.5 antigen, absence of CD15, and high LDH level were associated with poor survival. CR duration was not influenced by any of the factors studied, including antigen expression. These results suggest that leukaemias with less differentiated phenotype have a lower response rate to induction treatment.\n",
      "The human monoclonal antibody Ha6D3 of the IgM type was used to stain malignant lymphoma cells from peripheral blood in flow cytometry and from cryosections of lymph nodes using the immunoperoxidase technique. It was found to react with peripheral white blood cells of all 12 cases of leukaemia and with lymph node cells of seven out of 11 B cell lymphomas and with the one T cell lymphoma tested so far. For in vivo experiments a batch of 70 mg Ha6D3 was purified and 6 mg Ha6D3 was injected intravenously into a chimpanzee with time intervals of 10 months and 1 month. The side effects observed were shivering, some muscular spasms and variations in the heart frequency. A decrease of lymphocytes of more than 50% was documented by haematogram analysis. The flow cytometry data showed that the Ha6D3 antigen does not modulate. Even after three repeated injections applied in a time interval of several months no immune response to Ha6D3 could be detected in vivo or in vitro. Based on these data we suggest that Ha6D3 may become a candidate for the treatment of certain leukaemias in vivo.\n",
      "We have reviewed our experience with four of the entities that are included under the generic term chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), namely the classic Ph+ CGL, both BCR+ and BCR-, aCML and CMML. We have developed a statistical model that confirms that CGL, aCML and CMML can be distinguished from each other with reasonable success employing five quantitative parameters (WBC, percentage immature granulocytes, percentage monocytes, percentage basophils, percentage erythroid precursors in bone marrow) and one qualitative parameter (granulocytic dysplasia). It is hoped that these detailed recommendations will enable investigators to improve their diagnostic accuracy. This should permit more uniform comparisons of molecular biologic and clinical studies.\n",
      "The serum level of pseudouridine, a modified nucleoside deriving mainly from t-RNA catabolism, was evaluated in 66 acute leukaemia patients at diagnosis to investigate its diagnostic and prognostic value, and its potential as a parameter with which to classify subtypes of the disease. Serum pseudouridine, measured by high performance liquid chromatography, was increased in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients (90% according to the pseudouridine index, which is the serum pseudouridine/creatinine ratio), and in acute myeloblastic leukaemia patients (75% according to the pseudouridine index). The increase was higher in the L3 than in the L1 and L2 subtypes. In the acute lymphoblastic leukaemia group there was a highly significant inverse correlation between serum pseudouridine levels and the most common end-point parameters used to assess disease outcome in leukaemia (i.e., complete remission rate, disease-free survival, and overall survival). In addition, 83% of patients with serum pseudouridine values < 5.5 nmol/mL were alive and in complete remission 12 months after the initial diagnosis, while only 11% of patients with serum pseudouridine values > 5.5 nmol/mL were alive and none were disease-free after the same period. This study: 1. demonstrates that the diagnostic sensitivity of the pseudouridine index is high in adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and good in acute myeloblastic leukaemia; 2. suggests that the serum pseudouridine assay can contribute to the classification of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; and 3. demonstrates unequivocally that both pseudouridine assay and the pseudouridine index are excellent independent prognostic markers for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n",
      "Ninety-four consecutive patients with acute leukaemia were analysed using cytochemical stains and, in selected individuals, a panel of monoclonal antibodies combined with measurement of the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. These results were correlated with the French-American-British morphological classification. Acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia was diagnosed in 55 individuals on the basis of morphology and cytochemical criteria; 6 of this group were further studied with antibodies directed against specific myelomonocytic antigens, but no further clinically useful information was obtained. Blasts from 36 patients did not stain with either Sudan black or myeloperoxidase. These individuals were considered to have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and were further assessed with monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes expressed on cells of lymphoid lineage; 10 were classified as arising from T precursors; 23 were of B lineage, of which 13 marked as common, 6 as null, 1 as pre-B, 2 as B-ALL and 1 to have a pattern characteristic of lymphoblastic lymphoma. Two cases could not be classified and 1 was found to have megakaryoblastic features. In a further 3 patients who had undergone lymphoblastic transformation as a terminal event in the course of chronic granulocytic leukaemia, 2 were immunophenotypically common and 1 was marked as a null cell. This study confirms the value of monoclonal antibodies for accurately assigning lineage to the acute leukaemias and particularly in those situations where conventional morphological criteria and cytochemical markers are inconclusive.\n",
      "The classification of acute leukaemias is now widely based on a combined morphological, cytochemical and immunophenotyping approach. Difficulties are frequently encountered however in reaching an acceptable degree of diagnostic concordance between different laboratories because of variations in the techniques used (in terms of methodologies, reagents and equipment) and diagnostic interpretation. The International Council for Standardization in Haematology (ICSH) convened an expert panel to consider currently available diagnostic techniques with the aim of defining a minimum cytochemical and immunological diagnostic panel that could be used as core components for the classification of acute leukaemia. The proposed ICSH scheme, which attempts to balance the basic requirement for providing precise and informative diagnostic information without limiting its use to only those laboratories with sophisticated facilities, is based on three sequential levels of investigation; primary cytochemistry, intracellular phenotyping and membrane immunophenotyping. The minimum ICSH recommended cytochemistries comprise myeloperoxidase (MPO), chloroacetate esterase (ChlorE) and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), and standardised methods for these cytochemistries are detailed in this communication. For cases of acute leukaemia that remain unclassified by primary cytochemistry, subsequent immunological analyses for cytoplasmic CD3, CD22, MPO and nuclear TdT are recommended. The ICSH panel considers that the use of these minimum primary cytochemical and intracellular phenotyping procedures will lead to the consistent classification of most acute leukaemias, and that the third level of investigation (membrane immunophenotyping) should be used for the purposes of confirmation, diagnostic clarification of atypical leukaemias, and the subtyping of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL). The ICSH panel also recognised that there are a number of additional technologies which can provide definitive diagnostic information, such as cytogenetics and DNA genotyping, but these were excluded from the minimum panel because of their restricted availability. While many specialised laboratories, particularly in the areas of diagnostic research, will continue to use individual investigatory protocols, it is considered that the inclusion of the ICSH scheme as core components would lead to greater consistency when comparing independent studies of acute leukaemia.\n",

      "Megakaryocytopoiesis was morphologically investigated in 129 adults with de novo acute leukaemia. Three types were identified: type I (84 cases), no detectable megakaryocytes; type II (32 cases), quantitatively preserved megakaryocytes with normal morphology; type III (13 cases); quantitatively preserved megakaryocytes but with distinct dysplastic changes such as micromegakaryocytes and megakaryocytes with multiple small separated nuclei. Type III was found in M1 (one out of 21 cases), M2 (one out of 20 cases). M4 (eight out of 24 cases), M6 (two out of four cases) and hypoplastic leukaemia (one out of 13 cases). M3 cases were all classified into type I. Most of acute lymphoid leukaemia cases (21 cases) belonged to type II. Among AML cases, the complete remission (CR) rate by intensive chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside was significantly lower in type III (11%) than in types I (87%) and II (71%). Among M4 cases, CR rates in type III (14%) was also significantly lower than those in type I (75%) and II (100%). Thus, the present study indicates the importance of recognizing dysmegakaryocytopoiesis in AML for clarification of the heterogeneous biology or pathophysiology of acute leukaemias and formulation of an appropriate therapeutic strategy.\n",
      "Peripheral blood, bone marrow films, and bone marrow biopsy specimens from 110 patients, well characterised by clinical and laboratory studies, including electron microscopy, were reviewed, to determine proposals for the classification of chronic (mature) B and T cell leukaemias. On the basis of cytology and membrane phenotype the following disorders were defined: (i) B cell type: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL); CLL of mixed cell type, which includes cases with more than 10% and less than 55% prolymphocytes (CLL/PL), and a less well defined form with pleomorphic lymphocytes but less than 10% prolymphocytes; prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL); hairy cell leukaemia (HCL); HCL variant; splenic lymphoma with circulating villous lymphocytes; leukaemic phase of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (follicular lymphoma, intermediate, or mantle zone lymphoma and others); lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with peripheral blood disease (mostly Waldenström macroglobulinaemia); and plasma cell leukaemia. (ii) T cell type: T/CLL, which was differentiated from reactive T/lymphocytosis; T/PLL; adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma; and Sézary syndrome. The recognition of distinct entities within the B and T cell leukaemias seems to have clinical and epidemiological connotations. It is hoped that these proposals may serve as the basis for further work, discussion, and improved management of patients.\n",
      "A silver staining technique for nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) has been applied to bone marrow biopsies of various types of acute and chronic leukaemias. This method could be easily evaluated on resin-embedded bone marrow obtained from acute lymphocytic leukaemia (n = 12), acute myelogenous (n = 16), chronic lymphocytic (n = 16) and chronic granulocytic (n = 20) leukaemia. A significant difference (p < or = 0.1) was only found between the AgNOR numbers in nuclei of lymphocytes from acute and chronic leukaemia (mean of 1.23 to 1.40 and 1.58) and those of cells from acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemia (from a mean of 5.00 to 9.17 per nucleus). However, no significant difference was observed among cells of various types of acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemias, despite of their markedly higher staining intensity and proliferative activity. The greatest mean of AgNOR numbers was counted in monoblasts of acute myelomonocytic leukaemia. It is suggested, that higher AgNOR counts in nuclei of more malignant leukaemic cells are in parallel with their mitotic activity and could be related to their elevated cell turn-over.\n",
      "Recently, we have shown that patients with acute leukaemias and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), who showed increasing mixed chimaerism (MC) upon serial PCR analysis after transplant, have a significantly increased risk of relapse. To determine whether the increasing MC in these patients is caused by the reappearance of normal recipient haematopoiesis or by the reoccurrence of malignant cells, we purified different leucocyte subpopulations and analysed these subfractions with regard to their donor-recipient ratio by a PCR-based method for the analysis of minisatellite DNA regions. In 14 patients [eight acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), three acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and three MDS] subfractions were analysed when increasing MC was first noted upon serial analysis of the peripheral blood. In seven of these 14 patients (four ALL, two AML and one MDS), subfractions were characterized at the time of frank haematological relapse. In all 14 patients investigated with increasing MC, recipient cells were detected in different mononuclear cell subpopulations. In patients characterized during frank relapse, two distinct distribution patterns were found. Patients who relapsed before day +300 (one ALL, two AML and one MDS) showed recipient-derived (normal) cells in addition to blast populations in different mononuclear subsets as well as granulocytes. In patients with acute leukaemias who relapsed after day +300 (two ALL and one AML), only leukaemic cells were found that were of recipient origin, whereas all other haematopoietic cell lines were donor derived. These data show that persistent MC in the early post-transplant period is caused predominantly by normal recipient haematopoietic cells. This finding further supports the hypothesis that a state of mixed haematopoietic chimaerism may reduce the clinical graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect of alloreactive donor-derived effector cells in patients with acute leukaemias and MDS, and thus facilitate the proliferation of residual malignant cells that may have survived the preparative regimen.\n",
      "Homozygous deletions of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor gene CDKN2 (p16, MTS1) have been demonstrated to occur frequently in human cancer cell lines of different origin. However, in most primary tumours the frequencies of CDKN2 deletions are not well defined. We studied primary samples of 100 patients with lymphoid leukaemias [B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), n = 23; T-ALL, n = 7; B-cell chronic lymphocytic (B-CLL) or prolymphocytic (B-PLL) leukaemia, n = 50; T-CLL/T-PLL, n = 20] using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with eight overlapping cosmid clones covering the region on chromosome band 9p21 containing CDKN2. We did not observe any CDKN2 deletions in the 70 patients with chronic lymphoid leukaemias of B- or T-cell origin. Of the 23 patients with B-lineage ALL, one (4%) exhibited a CDKN2 deletion: in this patient, two clones were detected, one exhibiting a hemizygous and the other a homozygous deletion. On chromosome banding analysis, four patients with B-lineage ALL had a 9p aberration, whereas all CDKN2 copies were retained. In contrast, six of the seven (86%) patients with T-ALL exhibited CDKN2 deletions (homozygous, n = 4; hemizygous, n = 2). We conclude that hemizygous or homozygous deletions of the CDKN2 gene occur at high frequency in T-ALL and at low frequency in B-lineage ALL, supporting the role of this gene as a tumour suppressor, especially in T-ALL. However, from our data there is no evidence that CDKN2 is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphoid leukaemias of B- or T-cell origin.\n",
      "CD82 (KAI1) is a member of the tetraspan transmembrane protein family which has been cloned from lymphoblastoid variant cell lines. However, a role for CD82 in early normal and malignant haemopoiesis has not yet been characterized. We studied the CD82 expression in 33 normal donor samples and 98 leukaemias by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We demonstrated that CD82 was moderately expressed in the vast majority of normal granulocytes and monocytes. In contrast, only about one third of the peripheral blood lymphocytes were weakly CD82 positive (CD82+). Interestingly, judgement of the CD82 transcription and expression in various leukaemias revealed that CD82 was overexpressed in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients in accelerated or blastic phase (CML-AP/BP) as well as in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients. Analysis of AML patients with CD34+/CD82+ blasts prompted us to expand our studies on haemopoietic CD34+ progenitor cells. Intriguingly, 84-95% of the CD34+ cells isolated from healthy bone marrow, cord blood or peripheral blood were highly CD82+. CD82 was abundantly expressed on primitive as well as on committed haemopoietic progenitor cells. After in vitro induction of myeloid differentiation in CD34+ peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC), the expression of CD82 decreased to levels similar to those found on peripheral blood granulocytes. These observations suggest for the first time a role for CD82 in normal and malignant haemopoiesis.\n",
      "Analysis of bone marrow slides from 1,386 patients entered into the Medical Research Council 8th and 9th trials in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia confirmed that features associated with differentiation in blast cells, in particular increasing Sudan Black (SB) positivity, were the most important morphological features for predicting remission achievement (P = 0.002) and hence survival (P less than 0.0001). SB positivity was also weakly predictive of remission duration (P = 0.05). A low complement of maturing granulocytes was associated with early induction death and a high percentage of blasts with shorter remissions. The few patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (FAB M3) had a high haemorrhagic death rate during induction and a low relapse rate. Apart from this, lineage involvement was not predictive of outcome. Multiple lineage leukaemias, in particular those with megakaryocytic and/or erythroid involvement, which had been reported previously to have a poor prognosis, did not have any worse remission rates in this series. When more than one cell line was involved, no combination with particularly good or poor prognosis could be identified. Multivariate analysis suggested that percentage SB positivity was adequate on its own to divide granulocytic leukaemias into poorly differentiated (less than 50% SB +ve) and well-differentiated groups (50% or more SB +ve) without the need for further measurements. This simple and reproducible test was strongly predictive of resistant disease but not of induction deaths. It was of considerably greater prognostic value--and was less open to inter-observer disagreement--than the FAB criteria which are usually used to classify granulocytic lineage leukaemias into the M1 and M2 subgroups. It is proposed that greater than or equal to 50% of blasts with SB positivity should replace blasts greater than 10% of maturing myeloid cells for this sub-categorization between M1 and M2.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there was an increased incidence of leukaemias and lymphomas in young people aged less than 25 years in the locality of a petrochemical plant at Baglan Bay, South Wales. METHODS: Geographical population based study to compare the observed and expected incidence of leukaemia and lymphoma with onset before the age of 25, in the years 1974 to 1991. The population was aged 0-24 years and lived within 1.5 and 3 km of the plant. The observed number of cases in various categories were compared with the expected numbers of cases calculated from the Welsh cancer registration rates. RESULTS: Although the observed numbers were generally greater than would be expected, none of the comparisons showed significant excess of leukaemias or lymphomas for any period of years. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that the incidence of leukaemias and lymphomas in children and young people in the area around the BP Chemical site at Baglan Bay, South Wales, between the years 1974 and 1991 was not significantly greater than normal.\n",
      "Correlation between the FAB classification and immunophenotype was studied in 169 consecutive adult patients with acute leukaemia (AL). The lineage of leukaemic cells could be determined in the majority of cases, whereas 3 patients (1.8%) remained unclassified. In 22 out of 71 patients (31%) with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) FAB M1 and M2 types, and in 5 out of 16 patients (31%) with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in myeloid blast crisis, leukaemic cells did not express myeloid lineage-related markers, indicating asynchronous expression of cell markers in a substantial proportion of patients. Flow cytometric two-colour immunofluorescence revealed mixed AL immunophenotype in 6 out of 169 patients (3.4%). This group included five CD2+AML (5% of AML tested) and one undifferentiated AL expressing CD10(CALLA), CDw65(VIM-2). The former group included FAB M1, M2, M3 and M4 forms of AML with a single cell population, and an AML M2 patient with both cytochemically and immunologically two separate populations of leukaemic cells. This further illustrates the heterogeneity of the target cell(s) for leukaemogenesis and the level of differentiation of AML cells. However, there was no difference in the treatment response and the remission duration between AML patients and patients with mixed phenotype AML.\n",
      "The expression of the transferrin receptor (TfR) was studied in the acute leukaemias and lymphoproliferative disorders by means of indirect immunofluorescence and/or the enhanced alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) techniques using monoclonal antibodies to the receptor. A total of 174 cases of acute leukaemia and lymphoproliferative disorder were studied. The results indicate that the receptor is expressed with increased density in the majority of positive cases of acute leukaemia. The lymphoproliferative disorders, however, only expressed the receptor in a minority of cases and did so with weak density. It is proposed that this weak expression in the lymphoproliferative disorders may be of use as an indicator of an increase in cell activity.\n",
      "We report the case of a 78-year-old man who presented with acute myeloid leukaemia showing subpopulations of cells expressing platelet-associated markers and the presence of a pan-myeloid component, besides glycophorin A-positive cells. Most of the immature cells had a proerythroblast-like morphology and we classified this case as an FAB-M6 variant, as suggested by Bain (1). According to the WHO classification, this leukaemia fulfilled the criteria of'AML with multilineage dysplasia' (2). Immunophenotyping characteristics showed two distinct aberrant subpopulations, a young pan-myeloid (CD45+ with low density, CD34+, CD117+, CD13+, CD33+, partial cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase (MPO)+) population with platelet-associated markers (CD41+, CD42+, CD61+) and a CD45+, CD117+, CD34- population with partial CD235a positivity indicative for erythroid maturation. This case belongs to the group of 'early' erythroblastic leukaemias where a subset of progenitor cells present with erythroid-megakaryocyte bipotentiality or are blocked at an early BFU-E (burst-forming unit erythrocyte)-like stage of erythroid differentiation (11, 12, 13).\n",
      "We have studied the capacity of peripheral blood cells from 26 chronic B cell leukaemias to proliferate continuously in culture; 72 attempts to establish cell lines were made. The cells were treated in vitro with or without stimulating agents: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and/or phorbol-ester (TPA) were the most frequently used. Fourteen cell lines of continuous growth were established from cells from 11 patients, but only four of these were proven to be derived from the original leukaemic cells. Only in the latter four lines were the karyotypic abnormalities and the patterns of immunoglobulin (Ig)-gene rearrangements identical to those found in the patients' leukaemic cells. On the other 10 lines, five had both kappa- and lambda-producing cells, and the remaining five, despite showing light-chain restriction, were proved to be non-leukaemic clones by comparing the Ig-gene rearrangement patterns before and after culture. Three of the four leukaemic cell lines (JVM-2, JVM-3 and JVM-13) were induced by EBV + TPA and derived from prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) cases; the fourth (JVM-14) originated from a case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with increased percentage of prolymphocytes whose cells were stimulated in vitro with EBV. The immunophenotype of the three PLL lines is more mature than that of the original prolymphocytes, as shown by a reduction in surface-Ig and FMC7 expression, enhancement of cytoplasmic-Ig and increase in CD38- and transferrin receptor-positive cells. The cells from line JVM-14 retained the CD5-antigen, a marker of CLL. This study suggests that PLL and some CLL clones are arrested at a stage of maturation ideally suited to be triggered to continuous proliferation in culture. The presence of consistent chromosomal abnormalities in PLL may offer an alternative explanation for the greater proliferative potential of these cells in vitro.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: There is little data available on the occurrence of leukaemias in India. This is despite a large number of patients being diagnosed and treated at various cancer centres all over the country. We, therefore, analysed the available data of the Bombay Cancer Registry to ascertain the epidemiological characteristics of leukaemias in India. METHODS: The incidence and mortality rates of leukaemias by cell type and sex were obtained for the most recent 5 years (1989-93). The data of the past 30 years were used to study the time trends using a linear regression model based on the logarithms of the incidence rates. RESULTS: Leukaemias constituted 3.9% of all registered cancer cases and 5.4% of all registered deaths in Greater Mumbai. Males were affected more frequently than females. Myeloid leukaemias were the commonest. A bimodal age incidence was observed with the first peak in childhood, a trough between 15 to 19 years of age and a slow rise thereafter. Among the various religious groups Hindus had the highest rate. An increasing trend in the incidence of all types of leukaemias was also observed. CONCLUSION: The incidence of leukaemias in Greater Mumbai is comparable to world rates. There is a male preponderance in all cell types and an increase in incidence was observed over the last 30 years. The higher incidence of myeloid leukaemias observed by us might be related to under-reporting of chronic lymphatic leukaemia.\n",
      "The diagnosis of acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) is made when the cells of patients with acute leukaemias cannot be classified as myeloid or lymphoid by means of morphological, cytochemical and immunological criteria. The mononuclear cells of eight different AUL patients were cultured in suspension for 3 d with or without TPA. After culture, especially in the presence of TPA, the cells of all patients expressed at least one myeloid membrane antigen. It was shown that this antigen expression was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and not influenced by inhibition of proliferation.\n",
      "The reactivity of a monoclonal anti-neutrophil elastase antibody (NP57) with routinely processed biopsy samples from various acute leukaemias has been examined and compared with that of chloroacetate esterase and CD15 (hapten X), two other myeloid cell-associated markers detectable in paraffin sections. No staining was seen with these markers in 14 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In contrast the neoplastic cells in 27 of 37 acute myeloid leukaemias were NP57 positive. Twenty of these were also positive for chloroacetate esterase, whereas CD15 was expressed in only six cases. These results indicate that detection of elastase with monoclonal NP57 forms a useful supplement to traditional methods for the histopathological diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemias.\n",
      "Leukaemia is a neoplastic disease characterized by an excessive proliferation of immature white blood cells and their precursors. Oral lesions may be the presenting feature of acute leukaemias, which can be rapidly fatal if left untreated. This report describes the case of a 22-year-old female who presented to a dental emergency department with oral manifestations of acute leukaemia. It outlines the role of oral lesions in the diagnosis of acute leukaemias and emphasizes the importance of immediate referral by general dental practitioners.\n",
      "DNA-fingerprint (DNA-F) analysis was successfully performed with DNA from 22 adult patients with acute leukaemia, including 13 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and nine patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The purpose of this study was to detect differences between the leukaemic phase (at diagnosis or relapse) and remission-phase DNA. We applied one simple repeat probe (GTG)5 and one minisatellite (M13) after DNA-digestion with different restriction endonucleases (HinfI and HaeIII) and agarose gel electrophoresis. In 7/13 patients with AML and 5/9 patients with ALL it was possible to detect loss of bands, additional bands or band shift with at least one of the probes. Together the probes M13 and (GTG)5 unveiled deviating fingerprint patterns in 54.6% of patients between leukaemic cells and remission-phase leucocytes. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was performed on six patients. In each case the DNA-F pattern of the donor was different from the relapse and the remission-phase pattern. We conclude from our studies that the probes M13 and (GTG)5 are useful in the detection of relapse and remission in acute leukaemias after chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.\n",
      "The acute leukaemias are a group of neoplastic diseases that are characterized by proliferation of immature white cells in the bone marrow and/or blood and are often associated with severe leukopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Oral manifestations are more common in patients with acute leukaemia. Oral bleeding, gingival enlargement, ulceration and infection in patients with leukaemia have been described. Leukaemic infiltrates in the gingivae are commonly seen in acute monocytic leukaemia. A case of acute monocytic leukaemia in a 34-year-old female who reported with gingival enlargement is presented here. The role of oral lesions as a diagnostic indicator is discussed.\n",
      "Three patients with secondary acute leukaemia after treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitor agents are described. Two patients had acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). FAB M5a, one had pro-B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The interval between initiation of chemotherapy and the onset of secondary acute leukaemia was 19-20 months. 11q23 rearrangements were detected in all cases. They were due to translocations t(11;19) (q23;p13.3), t(11;16)(q23;p13) and t(4;11)(q21;q23), respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with Yeast Artificial Chromosome (YAC) probe 13HH4 spanning the ALL-1 gene on 11q23 confirmed that in each case the ALL-1 gene had been disrupted by the translocations. The study underlined the relationship between the development of secondary acute leukaemias with 11q23 rearrangement and previous chemotherapy with topisomerase II inhibitor agents. So far, however, only six adult patients with secondary ALL with t(4;11) after treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitor agents have been reported. All with t(4;11) mostly occurs in infants or young children. Our patient received epirubicin continuously for >19 months. This indicates that both myeloid and lymphoid leukaemias with involvement of the ALL-1 gene can be induced by exogenous agents, especially topoisomerase II inhibitors. Thus they may have a common biological background. This hypothesis was substantiated by means of combined immunophenotyping and FISH (FICTION). In the case of AML M5a with t(11;19), the tumour cells with ALL-1 rearrangement expressed CD34. Moreover, the pro-B-ALL with t(4;11) was CD34 positive. These findings suggest that the cell of origin of secondary AML and ALL with 11q23 rearrangement is an immature haemopoietic progenitor cell.\n",
      "Over a 4 1/2-year period, 141 patients with acute leukaemia had morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytochemical studies performed at King College Hospital. Seven cases were noted to have blast cells which did not express myeloid or lymphoid antigens or cytochemical staining indicative of differentiation but were HLA DR and CD 34 positive. Based on these criteria we have used the term stem cell acute leukaemia to denote these patients. There were five women and two men with a median age of 61 years (16-86). Presentation marrows were heavily infiltrated with blasts (greater than 95% in 6/7) which were usually pleomorphic. Type 2 blasts. Auer rods and dysplastic features were absent. Two of six cases studied showed clonal karyotypic abnormalities. Four patients were treated with high dose chemotherapy. Three of these achieved a complete remission but relapsed at 3, 6 and 7 months respectively. The median survival of the group was 7 months (2-12). We conclude that the stem cell acute leukaemias are a distinct clinicomorphological group which appear to have a poor prognosis with conventional chemotherapy.\n",
      "Acute myelo-monoblastic (AMML) and acute monoblastic (AML) leukemias have a bad prognosis, especially in children when occurring in the first months of life. We report 3 cases of such leukaemias in which skin lesions preceded and revealed the leukemia. For the 3 infants, cutaneous lesions appeared about one month before the other signs of leukaemia (2 AML and 1 AMML). Skin biopsies from all 3 infants revealed a heavy dermic infiltration by large cells with round or irregular vesicular nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm. These atypical cells did not express any lymphoid markers but reacted strongly with monocytic-macrophagic antibodies (CD68, CD13 and CD14). Two infants were treated by mitoxanthrone and cytarabine with complete remission. The third one was not treated because of a very poor general status. Skin involvement is frequent in these nonlymphoid leukaemias (30% to 50% of cases). In only 7% of cases, leukemic skin lesions precede and reveal the other signs of leukemia by weeks or months. Then, it is very important to repeat the blood cell counts and to biopsy the skin lesions in order to make a diagnosis of leukemia as early as possible.\n",
      "We report a case of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), which transformed first into acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and then into acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In the AML and ALL phases, chromosome analysis showed a classic Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) t(9:22)(q34:q11). Molecular studies showed breakpoint cluster region rearrangement between exons e1 and a2 compatible with a p190(bcr/abl) breakpoint as observed in Ph-positive lymphoblastic acute leukaemia. The minor (m-bcr) rearrangement was also detected during complete remission. This observation supports a multistep pathogenesis of leukaemias, and that the p190(bcr/abl) breakpoint may influence the course of the disease.\n",
      "PMN elastase is a useful additional parameter in the differential diagnosis of the leukaemias. In all patients with myelocytic leukaemias there were elevated levels of elastase-alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (E-alpha 1PI), while in the lymphatic leukaemias complexed elastase levels were decreased. The highest values were found in the peripheral blood plasma and bone marrow plasma of patients with CML. Despite high E-alpha 1PI concentrations there were no signs of bleeding or consumption of plasmatic coagulation factors. In AML a wide range of E-alpha 1PI levels was observed, extending from slightly elevated to four hundred-fold increased. In myeloblastic leukaemias without maturation (FAB M 1) the concentrations of complexed elastase remained below 150 ng/ml. In myeloblastic leukaemias with maturation (FAB M2) the E-alpha 1PI values ranged between 214 ng/ml and 850 ng/ml (means = 402 +/- 69), and in myelo-monoblastic leukaemias (FAB M4) between 450 ng/ml and 720 ng/ml (means = 663 +/- 72). The only case of promyelocytic leukaemia (FAB M 3) exhibited an extremely high value of 4,550 ng/ml, while a monocytic leukaemia (FAB M5) showed an extremely low value of 5 ng/ml. During cytostatic therapy there was a rapid decrease in levels of complexed elastase, with E-alpha 1PI values returning to normal in remission. In recidivating cases there was an increase of E-alpha 1PI levels in AML and a decrease in ALL. There was a correlation between the E-alpha 1PI concentrations in peripheral plasma and leukaemic bone marrow infiltration, so providing a good basis for monitoring remission from leukaemia and indicating relapse. It was also interesting to observe an extremely low E-alpha 1PI level (5 ng/ml) in patients with myelodysplasia. Under Decortin/Plenastril therapy the concentration rose to 50 ng/ml. An E-alpha 1PI level of 10 ng per ml was observed in one case of Ranitidine agranulocytosis. Under corticoid therapy the value returned to normal within eight days.\n",
      "Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) terminating in acute leukaemia (AL) is an infrequent condition. In several cases, flow cytometric analysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored membrane proteins such as DAF and CD59/MACIF has suggested the leukaemic cells to be derived from the PNH clone, thereby implicating PNH as a potential preleukaemic disease. In the present paper, we review the data for one patient treated in our hospital and 20 cases reported in the literature from 1969 to 1993. The sex ratio is 1 female/2 males, mean age at diagnosis of PNH was 46 years and the mean interval between the diagnoses of PNH and AL was 53 months. AL type was AML M6 in 8 patients, other types of AML in 12 and ALL in one, with a mean survival of 7.1 months following diagnosis of AL. In all cases analyzed, the PNH phenotype of erythrocytes disappeared with progression of AL, whereas reappearance of this phenotype with complete remission of AL was inconstant. PNH would thus appear to be a potential preleukemic disease. When this disorder terminates in AL, the type is often AML M6, although ALL is also possible. The prognosis of AL in PNH is poor as for other secondary leukaemias. Apart from marrow aplasia, leukaemic transformation is another life threatening complication of PNH which may justify allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) and potential leukaemic transformation can therefore be an additional argument in favour of allo-BMT when pancytopenia develops in PNH patients.\n",
      "AIM: Myeloid/natural killer (NK) cell leukaemia is characterised by coexpression of myeloid with natural killer cell antigens, a high incidence of extramedullary disease and an aggressive clinical course. METHODS: We report a case of a 28-year-old woman with myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukaemia. Clinical presentation was correlated with leukaemic blast morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetic analysis, molecular studies for clonal rearrangements and histological review. RESULTS: The patient had noted skin lesions and a breast infiltrate 4 months prior to the diagnosis. Bone marrow biopsy at the time of presentation revealed characteristic morphological features with a dense infiltrate of bizarre, pleomorphic blast cells with marked nuclear invagination and reniform shapes. Immunophenotypic analysis of the blasts displayed coexpression of myeloid and natural killer cell antigens with a relatively immature phenotype: CD34-,HLADR+, CD33+, CD56+, CD16-, CD57-, MPO-. Cyto- genetic analysis revealed a complex karyotype: del(6)(q21);-12 and add(19)(p13). Histological review of the previous breast biopsy was consistent with granulocytic sarcoma of the breast with a phenotype corresponding to the circulating blasts (positive cytoplasmic staining for myeloid markers, CD68 and CD31, and the NK cell marker CD56, with negative staining for MPO). Skin biopsy confirmed leukaemia cutis. CONCLUSION: Although nodal extramedullary disease is common in the myeloid/NK cell leukaemias, this is the first description of myeloid/NK cell leukemia primarily involving breast and skin. We speculate that CD56 may predispose to extramedullary localisation of tumour.\n",
      "Lactate dehydrogenase (LHD) content of serum and leukocytes was examined in 42 haematologically normal healthy volunteers and in 34 patients suffering from various types of leukaemia. All patients were studied at the time of presentation and before any therapeutic intervention. Serum LDH was elevated in all types of leukaemia. In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) a significant elevation of leukocyte LDH activity (p less than 0.005) was noted. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia leukocyte (ALL), LDH was significantly elevated when compared to normal lymphocyte LDH (p less than 0.01) levels, but not when compared to total normal leukocyte LDH levels. In chronic leukaemias, leukocyte LDH levels were not significantly different from the normal. Comparison of LDH isoenzyme pattern in peripheral blood cells with that of serum, both in normal and in leukaemia cases showed more \"M\" type enzyme in the cells than in the serum. However, the \"M\" type enzyme was significantly elevated only in AML cases (p less than 0.005). Serum LDH and peripheral blood leukocyte count compared in normal subjects and in leukaemia cases showed no correlation.\n",
      "The incidence of adult leukaemias, their response to therapy and the complications of therapy were studied in 121 cases over seven years (1981-1987). All cases were followed up till recovery or death for periods ranging from seven days to seven years. Adult leukaemias accounted for 2.56% of all admissions due to malignancies. There were 21 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 61 of acute myelogenous leukaemia, 36 of chronic myelocytic leukaemia and 3 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. All received aggressive combination chemotherapy. Remission could be achieved in 57% to 60% of cases. Infection (34%), bleeding (34%), and central nervous system involvement (25%) were the complications during therapy. The cause of death was ascertained in 87 of 90 deaths by a detailed postmortem. Haemorrhage (34.5%), infection (31%) and uncontrolled leukaemia (22%) were the leading causes, either singly or in combination. Some of the uncommon causes of death were fulminant hepatic failure, coronary artery disease, gangrene of the colon and disseminated tuberculosis.\n",
      "In 74 cases of acute leukaemia and of the blastic phase of chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CML), monoclonal antibodies of the \"VI\" series and a few commercially available antibodies proved to be of valuable help in establishing a definite diagnosis. In 4 out of 35 cases of AML (FAB-M 1-5), and in 2 out of 16 of the blastic phase of CML only the use of monoclonal antibodies secured the diagnosis. In the group of acute lymphoid leukaemias subtypes corresponding to various levels of differentiation, were defined. The blasts of 3 patients out of the 74 did not express any of the markers studied. Two additional cases were investigated for platelet peroxidase and studied with the antiplatelet antibodies VIPL 1, 2 and 3 by the electron microscope. These cases proved to be acute megakaryoblastic leukaemias (acute myelofibrosis).\n",
      "This paper describes an analysis of the geographical variation of childhood leukaemia incidence in Great Britain over a 15 year period in relation to natural radiation (gamma and radon). Data at the level of the 459 district level local authorities in England, Wales and regional districts in Scotland are analysed in two complementary ways: first, by Poisson regressions with the inclusion of environmental covariates and a smooth spatial structure; secondly, by a hierarchical Bayesian model in which extra-Poisson variability is modelled explicitly in terms of spatial and non-spatial components. From this analysis, we deduce a strong indication that a main part of the variability is accounted for by a local neighbourhood 'clustering' structure. This structure is furthermore relatively stable over the 15 year period for the lymphocytic leukaemias which make up the majority of observed cases. We found no evidence of a positive association of childhood leukaemia incidence with outdoor or indoor gamma radiation levels. There is no consistent evidence of any association with radon levels. Indeed, in the Poisson regressions, a significant positive association was only observed for one 5-year period, a result which is not compatible with a stable environmental effect. Moreover, this positive association became clearly non-significant when over-dispersion relative to the Poisson distribution was taken into account.\n",
      "Cancer registrations among young individuals (under age 30 years) for the 30-year period 1960-1989 were used to investigate the risk of leukaemia and lymphoma in migrants to Israel, and in their offspring, relative to Israel-born individuals with Israel-born parents. Relative risks by the father continent of origin, and odds ratios by continent of origin of mother or both parents, adjusted for age, sex and period, were estimated. The leukaemias showed little variation in risk by birthplace, and no change between generations. For non-Hodgkin lymphoma, however, there were quite large differences in incidence, with relatively high rates in migrants from Asia and Africa. These persisted to some degree into the second generation, suggesting that inherited susceptibility may underlie some of the variation.\n",
      "The phenomenon of spontaneous remission is one of the less well known aspects of the leukaemias. Spontaneous remission has been reported in both acute and chronic leukaemia. The mechanism is unclear but may involve immune modulation related to an intercurrent infection or transfusion of blood products. We present a rare case of spontaneous complete remission of T-cell large granular lymphocytic (T-LGL) leukaemia occurring in an 82-year-old man. The patient died two years later of an unrelated condition, with no evidence of recurrence of T-LGL leukaemia. Elucidation of the mechanism of the phenomenon of spontaneous remission may lead to advances in the treatment of this diverse group of disorders.\n",
      "Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) is a specific enzyme for cells of T-lymphocytic lineage. It has been attempted to induce DPP IV activity in DPP IV negative T-lymphoid leukaemias by 12-o-tetradecanoylphrobol-13-acetate (TPA). Isolated cells from peripheral blood of 6 healthy blood donors and 22 patients with various types of leukaemia were cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium with 20% fetal calf serum alone (control) or supplemented with 20% human placenta conditioned medium (HPCM) or with 16 nmol/l TPA for 3 days. The percentage of DPP IV positive lymphocytes from blood donors remained unchanged in control and HPCM cultures, but decreased significantly in TPA cultures. Leukemic cells from three DPP IV positive cases of acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) reacted to the TPA treatment in a similar manner. Leukaemic cells of two DPP IV negative T-ALL cases remained negative in all three types of cultures, thus no induction of DPP IV activity was found. Other normal blood cells as well as leukaemic cells of 7 null-ALL, 1 preB-ALL, 3 B-CLL and 6 AML patients were DPP IV negative before and after cultivation in all types of culture. These findings showed that DPP IV is specifically expressed in cells of T-lymphocytic lineage even after short-term cultivation. HPCM was found to have no effect on DPP IV activity in T-lymphoid cells.\n",
      "The simultaneous expression of both lymphoid and myeloid phenotypic features in acute leukaemia is rare. We report 3 cases of biphenotypic hybrid acute leukaemia seen in our institution. All 3 patients achieved remission with treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia but two subsequently relapsed while on treatment. The hybrid acute leukaemias are important areas for further research both for delineation of basic biology and choice of optimal treatment.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase I and II activities of peripheral mononuclear cells were studied to evaluate their role in diagnosis, assessment of therapy and follow up of remission in acute leukaemias. DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 40 untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukaemia and 40 healthy controls, before the therapy and after remission. The correlation between the activity of the enzymes and the efficacy of therapy were established. The enzyme activities were measured by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), using the method described by Amici. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon methods were used. RESULTS: Before the therapy, Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase I levels in the leukaemic group were found to be significantly elevated when compared to the control group (p<0.001). Also Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase II levels were significantly elevated before the therapy and during remission (p<0.02 and p<0.001 respectively). The isoenzyme activities were compared in patients who were in remission, who did not respond to therapy and in patients who died during the therapy, but no significant difference was found. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that, Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase I and II activities can be used as markers for diagnosis and follow up of remission in patients with acute leukaemia. But, they can not have predictive value for prognosis.\n",
      "Since 1976 the Swiss Paediatric Oncology Groups (SPOG) has registered leukaemia cases occurring in Switzerland. The registration was set up for clinical research; however, since 1985 efforts have been made to complete the registers with cases not taking part in a clinical trial. The data of the SPOG register between 1976 and 1989 are compared to data from cancer registers and the mortality statistics of the Federal Office of Statistics. Between 1985 and 1988 the SPOG register included 91% of the cases recorded by the six cantonal registries. Compared to mortality data, registration was 100% in 1989. The SPOG data file can therefore be assumed to be complete enough to be used for epidemiological studies on incidence of leukaemias and on time trends of leukaemias in Switzerland.\n",
      "For further analysis of their lineage affinity the differentiation capacity of five cases of acute unclassified leukaemias were studied in vitro using 5 nM 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate as an inducing agent. After 4 d in vitro a co-expression of both myeloid and early B-lymphoid or myeloid and early T-lymphoid antigens on the same population of cells was found. While ultrastructural analysis of the blasts prior to culture revealed the morphology of undifferentiated blasts without any specific endogenous peroxidase activity, the cultured blasts displayed monoblastic features and myeloperoxidase activity after 4 d in vitro. Since this type of peroxidase is highly specific for the myelomonocytic lineage the data indicate myelomonocytoid differentiation of all five cases studied. The co-expression of lymphoid as well as myeloid antigens and myeloperoxidase by the same blasts after culture could be indicative of bilineage differentiation capacity characterizing the original blasts as bipotential progenitor cells.\n",
      "A study of childhood malignancies in North Humberside for 1974-1986 has revealed significant spatial aggregations. Though no specific reason was found, certain geographical areas, tumour groups and putative risks were identified for further study. One possible risk was a tin smelter to the west of Hull. A new method of analysis (Stone conditional Poisson maximum) was used and showed some evidence of increased risk close to the smelter. This was accounted for by the solid tumours (primarily central nervous system malignancies) and was not apparent for the leukaemias. The Poisson maximum method is a special case of isotonic regression; a more general isotonic regression method, also due to Stone, Maximum Likelihood Ratio (MLR), is also available, and for reasons described elsewhere we prefer the more general method. The present study begins by applying this to the childhood data and then to data for corresponding adult disease (leukemias and central nervous system tumours) in the same area and time period. In both children and adults the results are negative for the leukaemias. For the remaining tumour categories, there is a significant increase in risk close to the smelter, but it is not possible to identify any aspect of the smelter or feature in its vicinity as causative.\n",
      "The expression of membrane CD11c by leukaemic blast cells was examined (indirect immunorosetting) in 75 cases of acute leukaemia (myeloid, n = 60; lymphoid, n = 15) and evaluated as a potential marker for the diagnostic discrimination between monocytic (AMML-M4 and AMoL-M5) and non-monocytic (M1, M2 and M3) AML subtypes. Preliminary studies of normal bone marrow cells indicated that CD11c expression was not restricted to cells of monocytic lineage but was also present, with apparent lower density, on significant proportions of mature and immature granulocytes. Examination of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) subtypes revealed that the non-monocytic leukaemias (n = 33) were CD11c-, defined as less than 30% positive cells, whereas all but one of the AMML-M4 (n = 13) and AMoL-M5 (n = 14) cases were CD11c+. All 15 cases of lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) showed less than 5% CD11c+ blasts. Membrane CD11c expression was also compared to the more widely used markers of monocytic differentiation; cytoplasmic alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) and membrane CD14 expression. This analysis showed that all 13 AMML-M4 leukaemias studied, including seven cases that were CD14- and eight that were ANAE-, were CD11c+. In addition, the AMoL-M5 cases (all of which were ANAE+) could be phenotypically subdivided into CD11c+ CD14+ (n = 9), CD11c+ CD14- (n = 4) and CD11c- CD14- (n = 1) subgroups. The study also confirmed that the discriminitive ability and sensitivity of the immunorosetting procedure for the detection of membrane CD11c compared favourably to immunofluorescent staining intensities as measured by flow cytometry.\n",
      "Forty primary leukaemias that arose in vivo as a consequence of 3 Gy X-irradiation of inbred mouse strains were analysed for Y-chromosome aberrations by conventional cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Compared with control mice which were X-irradiated but which exhibited no overt signs of leukaemia, the loss and gain of Y-chromosomes in leukaemic spleen cells defined subclonal variants in the radiation-induced haemopoietic malignancies that arose in CBA/H, DBA/2 and (C57BL/6 x DBA/2)F1 mice. This Y-chromosome instability was significantly higher than that observed in spleen cells of age-matched (or older) irradiated control mice that had not developed overt leukaemia. The detection of Y-chromosome aberrations is considered in the context of the high numbers of potential gene regulatory sequences in the murine Y-chromosome and the potential for the insertional activation of cellular genes during multi-stage radiation leukaemogenesis.\n",
      "We describe a simple PCR method to detect highly polymorphic repetitive DNA markers (microsatellites) in leukaemia using DNA from fresh and archival bone marrow smears. Neither the period of storage nor staining of the slides affected microsatellite PCR. Comparison of slide DNA with constitutive DNA from buccal epithelium revealed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with at least one marker in four of 11 leukaemias. Marrow smears offer an attractive archival source of DNA for the detection of microsatellite markers. Applications include detection of LOH or tracing the origin of cell populations, e.g. in bone marrow transplant recipients.\n",
      "Myeloid leukaemia can be induced reproducibly in CBA/H male mice following X-irradiation. After serial passage of the leukaemic cells into syngeneic recipients, they grow faster and require fewer cells for a take. Transplantation of primary leukaemias requires high cell doses unlike passaged lines derived from them. Passaging at low cell doses retains their primary-like growth and morphological properties. It would seem that these low cell dose passages may be a more useful model which can be used for investigating the biology and therapeutic responses of myeloid leukaemia than routinely passaged cell lines.\n",
      "We have constructed a complementary DNA (cDNA) library representing expressed sequences of the white blood cells from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukaemia. The library was screened by colony hybridization of 32P-labelled cDNAs synthesized from the polyadenylated RNAs of the white blood cells from patients with chronic granulocytic or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The autoradiographic patterns were compared and 70 recombinants were selected to comprise a panel which distinguished between these two types of leukaemia. Hybridization of this panel with complementary DNAs transcribed from the polyadenylated RNAs of a variety of normal and neoplastic leucocyte populations showed that the RNA sequences in high abundance in leucocytes from chronic granulocytic leukaemias differ quite radically from those in other leucocytes. The patterns of hybridization seen when this panel was challenged with cDNAs representing the RNAs of normal and leukaemic leucocyte populations were sufficiently different to distinguish clearly the peripheral blood leucocytes of chronic granulocytic leukaemias from other populations of white blood cells, both normal and leukaemic. We suggest that this approach might provide additional markers useful in the classification of the acute leukaemias, especially the undifferentiated leukaemias whose identification by conventional methods is uncertain.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To determine whether loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific chromosomal loci in radiation-induced leukaemias, arising in a similar genetic background, is leukaemia-type specific (myeloid versus lymphoid) or common to both. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leukaemias that arose in 3 Gy X-irradiated (CBA/H x C57BL/6)F1 intercross and backcross mice were diagnosed as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or thymic lymphoma (TL). LOH was determined using 28 polymorphic microsatellite markers distributed over seven chromosomes using control and leukaemic DNA from individual mice. RESULTS: LOH incidences of 0-20% were observed at most loci in both leukaemia types. Specific LOH incidences of 38-76% were observed for myeloid (chromosome 2) and lymphoid (chromosomes 11 and 14) leukaemias. Chromosome 4 LOH was frequently (38-50%) observed in both types, although the commonly deleted regions differed. LOH was detected at either chromosome 2 or 4 in AML and either chromosome 4 or 11 in TL. CONCLUSIONS: LOH incidences of 38-76% suggest a causal role of particular loci which is mainly, but not exclusively, dependent on leukaemia type. LOH incidences of 0-20% at other loci in both leukaemias suggest that many genetic deletions are non-causal and incidental in radiation-leukaemogenesis.\n",
      "Blood samples from 40 adult patients with untreated acute leukaemia were processed through the Technicon H*1 blood autoanalyser which gives a complete white cell differential count using flow cytochemistry and provides white cell cytograms as well. We examined the differences in the percentage differential counts and the white cell cytograms of various FAB types of acute leukaemia in an attempt to estimate the usefulness of this easily obtainable data for the identification of acute leukaemias. Differentiation of the 33 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases from the 7 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases was possible on the basis of lymphocyte percentage (AML mean 29.6 vs. ALL mean 67.1, p < 0.01), monocyte percentage (AML mean 12.5 vs. ALL mean 3.3, p < 0.001), mean peroxidase activity value (AML mean -12.6 vs. ALL mean -0.6, p < 0.01) and the absence of IG flag (circulating immature granulocytes) in ALL. Interestingly, the FAB subtypes of AML could be distinguished from each other on the basis of characteristic patterns of cell distribution in the peroxidase cytogram when the total white cell count was over 10 x 10(9)/l. Even with lower counts the differences were distinctive providing that circulating blasts were present.\n",
      "Here we report that the slow-transforming helper component of Friend murine leukaemia virus (Fr-MLV), which produces lymphoid leukaemias in normal mice, induces erythroleukaemia in mice given syngeneic pituitary grafts (SPG). Newborn mice were infected with Fr-MLV and, at one month of age, were transplanted with two pituitary glands under the kidney capsule. Sham-operated infected mice and uninfected transplanted mice served as controls. SPG selectively reduced the mean survival times of infected mice. Histopathology showed that, while most infected non-transplanted mice developed lymphoid leukaemias, virtually all Fr-MLF-infected mice given SPG developed erythroleukaemias. Experiments in vitro showed that Fr-MLV infection markedly depressed concanavalin A induced DNA synthesis in cells from spleen, thymus and lymph nodes. Addition of prolactin or growth hormone further suppressed lectin-induced mitogenesis of lymphoid cells from infected mice, but failed to influence the response of uninfected controls. These experiments indicate that, in mice, pituitary hormones modulate the development and the histological features of Fr-MLV induced leukaemias, and suggest that endocrine-immunological interactions play a role in retrovirus induced tumorigenesis.\n",
      "The glutathione S-transferases are a group of enzymes involved in the detoxification of a wide range of xenobiotics. Elevation of the level of activity of glutathione S-transferases within the cytosol has been associated with the development of resistance to a number of cytotoxic drugs, including some commonly used in the treatment of leukaemia. In this paper we describe the purification and characterization of an anionic (p class) form of the enzyme from the peripheral blood of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and the spleen of a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We present evidence that the form of enzyme purified closely resembles pi class glutathione S-transferase purified from human placenta. Immunoblotting performed on cytosol from the leukaemic cells from a range of cases of leukaemia at presentation, or on treatment, demonstrated that this form of glutathione S-transferase was the predominant isoenzyme expressed in all cases studied. However, in the limited number of cases studied there was no correlation between the level of expression and response to chemotherapy, suggesting that increased expression of pi class GST is not the sole cause of resistance to bifunctional alkylating agent in human leukaemias.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to find out whether the membrane glycoprotein P-170 can be detected in human tumours with both acquired and intrinsic resistance to chemotherapeutic agents using monoclonal antibodies (265/F4 and C219) and the streptavidin-biotinylated phycoerythrin complex method. Pretreated leukaemia cells and untreated lung and ovarian carcinomas were analysed. Two plasmacytomas and one leukaemia expressed high levels of P-glycoprotein, whereas two leukaemias showed moderate, and three leukaemias no expression of this protein. The intrinsic resistance was analysed with a panel of four human epidermoid lung cancer xenografts grown in nude mice. The expression of P-glycoprotein could be correlated with the degree of resistance. In addition, one out of five ovarian carcinomas revealed a high level of P-glycoprotein.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk of leukaemia in workers in the petroleum distribution industry who were exposed to low levels of benzene. METHODS: From the cohort of distribution workers, 91 cases were identified as having leukaemia on either a death certificate or on cancer registration. These cases were compared with controls (four per case) randomly selected from the cohort, who were from the same company as the respective case, matched for age, and alive and under follow up at the time of case occurrence. Work histories were collected for the cases and controls, together with information about the terminals at which they had worked, fuel compositions, and occupational hygiene measurements of benzene. These data were used to derive quantitative estimates of personal exposure to benzene. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated conditional on the matching, to identify those variables in the study which were associated with risk of leukaemia. Examination of the potential effects of confounding and other variables was carried out with conditional logistic regression. Analyses were carried out for all leukaemia and separately for acute lymphoblastic, chronic lymphocytic, acute myeloid and monocytic, and chronic myeloid leukaemias. RESULTS: There was no significant increase in the overall risk of all leukaemias with higher cumulative exposure to benzene or with intensity of exposure, but risk was consistently doubled in subjects employed in the industry for > 10 years. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia tended to occur in workers employed after 1950, who started work after the age of 30, worked for a short duration, and experienced low cumulative exposure with few peaks. The ORs did not increase with increasing cumulative exposure. The risk of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia seemed to be related most closely to duration of employment and the highest risk occurred in white collar workers with long service. These workers had only background levels of benzene exposure. There was no evidence of an association of risk with any exposure variables, and no evidence of an increasing risk with increasing cumulative exposure, mean intensity, or maximum intensity of exposure. The patterns of risk for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia were different from those of the lymphoid subgroups, in which duration of employment was the variable most closely related to risk. Risk was increased to an OR of 2.8 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.8 to 9.4) for a cumulative exposure between 4.5 and 45 ppm-years compared with < 0.45 ppm-years. For mean intensity between 0.2 and 0.4 ppm an OR of 2.8 (95% CI 0.9 to 8.5) was found compared with < 0.02 ppm. Risk did not increase with cumulative exposure, maximum intensity, or mean intensity of exposure when treated as continuous variables. Cases of acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia were more often classified as having peaked exposures than controls, and when variables characterising peaks, particularly daily and weekly peaks, were included in the analysis these tended to dominate the other exposure variables. However, because of the small numbers it is not possible to distinguish the relative influence of peaked and unpeaked exposures on risk of acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia. There was no evidence of an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia with increases in cumulative exposure, maximum intensity, mean intensity, and duration of employment, either as continuous or categorical variables. Analyses exploring the sensitivity of the results to the source and quality of the work histories showed similar patterns in general. However, no increases in ORs for categories of cumulative exposure were found for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia in the data set which included work histories obtained from personnel records still in existence, although numbers were reduced. Analyses excluding the last five and 10 years of exposure showed a tendency for ORs to reduce for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia, and to increase for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia. Limitations of the study include uncertainties and gaps in the information collected, and small numbers in subcategories of exposure which can lead to wide CIs around the risk estimates and poor fit of the mathematical models. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence in this study of an association between exposure to benzene and lymphoid leukaemia, either acute or chronic. There is some suggestion of a relation between exposure to benzene and myeloid leukaemia, in particular for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia. Peaked exposures seemed to be experienced for this disease. However, in view of the limitations of the study, doubt remains as to whether the risk of acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia is increased by cumulative exposures of < 45 ppm-years. Further work is recommended to review the work histories and redefine their quality, to explore the discrepancies between results for categorical and continuous variables, and to develop ranges around the expose estimates to enable further sensitivity analyses to be carried out.\n",
      "Blastic cells of acute lymphoid, acute myeloid and acute myelomonocytic leukaemias were studied by means of indirect immunofluorencence to provide more information on the presence of satellite nucleoli in blood cells. According to results, satellite nucleoli were found in a small but constant number of blastic cells disregarding their type and type of acute leukaemia. Satellite nucleoli exhibited a positive immunoreaction for fibrillarin and protein B23 which are characteristic for main nucleolar components. These findings suggest that satellite nucleoli contain fibrillar centers as well as dense fibrillar and granular components or at least proteins characteristic for these nucleolar components. Similarly as in normal and pathological cells of completely different origin, in blastic cells of acute leukaemias the number of satellite nucleoli per cells ranged between 1 and 2.\n",
      "A three-and-a-half-year-old boy presented in the blastic phase of chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) with lymphoblastic infiltration of CNS and testes. The clinical signs and symptoms and also blood and bone marrow findings were otherwise compatible with the chronic phase of the disease, and none of the factors predictive of early transformation were present. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that the Ph1 chromosome, with no additional chromosomal abnormalities, was present in 85% of the bone marrow cells. Meningeal leukaemia is almost unknown in the chronic phase of CML. However, the incidence in the blastic phase may resemble the incidence of CNS leukaemia at diagnosis in children with acute leukaemias. Testicular involvement appears to be extremely rare even in the blastic phase of CML; the \"true\" incidence may, however, also resemble that of acute leukaemias. This raises the question of the need for testicular and meningeal surveillance and prophylaxis, at least during the blastic phase of CML. One should consider whether the simultaneous meningeal and testicular lymphoblastic leukaemia in this patient was the result of blastic transformation at two independent sites, or whether the testes were seeded from the meninges without identifiable spread to blood and bone marrow.\n",
      "We tested the hypothesis that variation in population mixing attributable to the diversity of migrants moving to an area is associated with the incidence of childhood leukaemia and other childhood cancers. An ecological analysis was performed on 954 children (<15 years) diagnosed with a malignancy between 1986 and 1996 in 532 electoral wards in Yorkshire, UK. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for all childhood leukaemias (n=325), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n=248), central nervous system (CNS) tumours (n=236) and other solid tumours (n=393) Incidence of all childhood leukaemias was significantly lower in areas of high (top decile) population mixing (IRR 0.72, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.54-0.97) and higher in areas of low (bottom decile) population mixing (IRR 1.56, 95% CI 0.73-3.34), but similar patterns of incidence were not observed for central nervous system or other solid tumours. Population mixing may be a proxy for the range of infections circulating in a community and these results are consistent with the hypothesis that greater exposure to infections reduces the risk of developing childhood leukaemia by conferring efficient modulation of the immune system.\n",
      "Autologous lymphocyte populations from different phases of chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and preleukaemic disorders were compared for cytotoxic activity. 51Cr-release tests showed that T lymphocytes from the quiescent phase of CGL and from the remission phase of AML exerted cytotoxic activity against autologous tumour cells. Such activity was also found in patients with potentially preleukaemic haematological disorders characterized by cytopenia, but not in polycythaemia vera patients. In the majority of cases cytotoxic activity of T lymphocytes could be blocked by native gp70 antigens of gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GaLV) and baboon endogenous virus (BaEV). Blocking effect of carbohydrate-free gp70 as well as p15(E) antigens could be observed less frequently. The role of cell-mediated immune response to oncovirus antigens in the course of myeloproliferative diseases is discussed.\n",
      "This study reports the production of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and its use in ascertaining the myeloid lineage of blasts in leukaemia. Comparison of the immunocytochemical stain using the anti-MPO antibody with the routine cytochemical methodology showed that the former was more sensitive. In all subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML; 72 patients, M1-M6) greater number of MPO positive blast cells were observed by immunocytochemistry, the highest being in the promyelocytic leukaemia. It was also extremely specific for cells of the myeloid lineage as it did not react with blasts from acute lymphoblastic (50 patients) and megakaryoblastic leukaemias (1 patient). In addition, it proved most useful for the lineage determination of blasts from patients with undifferentiated acute leukaemias (AUL) and those with chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis (CML-BC). Out of 8 patients of AULs, 6 were classified as acute myeloblastic leukaemia due to their reactivity to the anti-MPO antibody. Similarly, out of 12 patients of chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis, blasts from 8 showed reactivity to this antibody and thus could be identified as belonging to the myeloid lineage and/or of the mixed blast crisis type.\n",
      "The success of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is limited by the major complications, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse. The very beneficial effect of maximal T-cell depletion of the graft for prevention of GVHD has been counterbalanced by an increase in graft failure and relapse of disease. Therefore, we started an approach of partial T-cell depletion of the graft. GVHD and graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) are strongly correlated after non-T cell-depleted BMT. Here, we report whether the correlation between GVHD and GVL also exists in partial T cell-depleted BMT from sibling donors. We retrospectively studied 117 adult patients with early haematological malignancies. Our method of partial T-cell depletion gave a relapse rate in patients with acute leukaemias similar to that observed in non-T cell-depleted BMT. However, patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia had a relapse rate that was similar to that observed in maximal T cell-depleted BMT. We found a significant correlation between the presence of chronic GVHD and an improved disease-free survival. Nevertheless, overall survival was lower in patients with chronic GVHD. There was no correlation between the occurrence of acute GVHD and disease-free or overall survival.\n",
      "In this study we describe 2 patients who appear to suffer from a morphological, cytochemical and clinico-haematological variant of T-prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL). The cells were smaller than typical prolymphocytes, with a regular nucleus containing a smaller and less prominent nucleolus; the alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) and acid phosphatase (AP) cytochemical reactions showed a weaker pattern of positivity in this variant compared to T-PLL. No immunological differences were found between the two conditions with regard to membrane expression and functional behavior of the cells. The clinical course and the outcome of the patients appears to be different: aggressive and rapidly fatal in T-PLL; thus far well-controlled in the T-PLL variant. From a molecular point of view, both cases showed a monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene.\n",
      "Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies for the immunophenotyping of haematological malignancies, we have made a direct comparison of the usefulness of indirect immunofluorescence using flow cytometry (IFC) alongside the alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) immunoenzyme method. Analysis of 400 consecutive patient samples (blood and bone marrow) over a 2-year period, resulted in unequivocal phenotyping agreement by both methods in 98 per cent of cases. The positive results accounting for 2 per cent discordance were obtained by the APAAP method. The value of the technique in the clinical management of patients with leukaemia is documented together with guidelines for clinical laboratories.\n",
      "The molecular basis of many leukaemias is now known, allowing precise diagnosis. Treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia is now possible by targeting of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. The underlying molecular abnormalities in acute leukaemias allow the outlook for individual patients to be assessed at diagnosis and therapy tailored accordingly. Analysis of V(H) genes in B-cell malignant disorders allows these to be placed in the hierarchy of B-cell development and may provide prognostically valuable information.\n",
      "Avian erythroblastosis virus, AEV-ES4, provides an ideal in vitro system to study oncogene co-operation in the development of erythroid leukaemias in chickens. Two oncogenes that use distinct signal transduction pathways have been identified; these act to produce a highly malignant phenotype and are an oncogenic version of a plasma membrane growth factor receptor that regulates haematopoietic progenitor self renewal and a mutated version of a transcription factor that suppresses specific gene expression. These two diverse types of oncogenes act together to generate a more malignant phenotype than would be expected merely from a summation of the individual oncogene effects. The aspects of normal growth control and the regulation of differentiation, which are altered in this system to generate the leukaemic phenotype, include changes in the balance between proliferation versus maturation, altered expression of differentiation genes and changes in growth factor responsiveness. These are exactly those features that are altered in human leukaemias. Thus, the avian leukaemia virus model has taught us important lessons that will help us to understand the basic molecular mechanisms that give rise to human leukaemia.\n",
      "Approaches to the management of adolescents and young adults with acute leukaemia were investigated by sending a questionnaire to hospitals identified as having diagnosed or treated patients aged 15-29 years. The responses demonstrated the types of hospital treating these patients, the haematologists' perceived practice for entry of patients to Medical Research Council (MRC) leukaemia trials and reasons for non-entry. Data were linked to MRC trials data to determine the proportion of patients aged 15-29 years at diagnosis in responding hospitals actually treated in MRC leukaemia trials in the 5 years preceding the questionnaire. Eighty-two per cent of haematologists stated that they entered patients 'always' or 'whenever possible' for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 76% for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but actual entry rates from the study hospitals were 46% of 239 AML patients and 36% of 182 ALL patients. The reasons most commonly reported for not entering eligible patients to national leukaemia trials were clinician preference for one arm of an MRC trial, a regional study or non-trial protocol, and concern about workload and ethical approval.\n",
      "A novel antibody microarray has been developed that provides an extensive immunophenotype of leukaemia cells. The assay is a solid phase cell-capture technique in which 82 antigens are studied simultaneously. This paper presents the analysis of 733 patients with a variety of leukaemias and lymphomas from peripheral blood and bone marrow. Discriminant Function Analysis of the expression profiles from these 733 patients and 63 normal subjects were clustered and showed high levels of consistency with diagnoses obtained using conventional clinical and laboratory criteria. The overall levels of consensus for classification using the microarray compared with established criteria were 93.9% (495/527 patients) for peripheral blood and 97.6% (201/206 patients) for bone marrow aspirates, showing that the extensive phenotype alone was frequently able to classify the disease when the leukaemic clone was the dominant cell population present. Immunophenotypes for neoplastic cells were distinguishable from normal cells when the leukaemic cell count was at least 5 x 10(9) cells/l in peripheral blood, or 20% of cells obtained from bone marrow aspirates. This technique may be a useful adjunct to flow cytometry and other methods when an extensive phenotype of the leukaemia cell is desired for clinical trials, research and prognostic factor analysis.\n",
      "AIMS: To analyse the forward scatter/side scatter (FSC/SSC) distribution of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) blast cells in order to assess whether it correlates with their morphology, immunophenotype, and clinical and biological disease characteristics. METHODS: FSC/SSC patterns were established upon taking into account the localisation of the residual T lymphocytes in the FSC/SSC dot plot as an internal biological standard. One hundred and seventy one newly diagnosed AML patients were analysed and five different FSC/SSC patterns were established. These five patterns could be grouped into two major categories taking into account the FSC/SSC distribution of normal cells in a bone marrow aspirate: immature patterns (1 and 2) and mature patterns (3, 4, and 5). These FSC/SSC patterns were correlated with different clinical and biological characteristics of AML patients. RESULTS: No significant associations were detected in relation to the clinical and haematological disease characteristics and the prognosis of these patients. By contrast there was a significant correlation between the FSC/SSC pattern of the AML blast cells and the FAB classification. An increased reactivity for the antigens associated with myeloid differentiation such as CD13, CD33, CD11b, CD15, CD14, CD4, CD56, and/or CD16 was detected among cases showing a mature FSC/SSC pattern (3, 4, and 5), both in the whole series and even within each of the FAB AML subtypes. By contrast, the reactivity for the CD34 precursor cell associated antigen was higher among those cases displaying an immature FSC/SSC pattern, this being observed even within each FAB subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The FSC/SSC pattern distribution of AML blast cells not only provides an additional objective and reproductible system for the classification of these leukaemias but it may also represent a connection between the FAB morphological groups and the immunophenotypic classification of AML patients.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Hyperleukocytosis is usually defined as leukocyte count >100 × 10(9)  L(-1) and can be seen in newly diagnosed leukaemias. Hyperleukocytic leukaemia is associated with a risk of organ failure and early death secondary to leukostasis. Mechanical removal of leukocytes by the apheresis technique, leukocytapheresis, is a therapeutic option in these patients. METHODS: During a 16-year period, 16 patients were treated with leukocytapheresis (35 apheresis procedures) for hyperleukocytosis/leukostasis. We present our experience, and in addition we review previous studies of hyperleukocytosis/leukocytapheresis in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). RESULTS: We used a highly standardised approach for leukocytapheresis in leukaemia patients with hyperleukocytosis. The average leukocytapheresis number for each patient was 2·2 (range 1-6). Median leukocyte count before apheresis was 309 × 10(9)  L(-1) (range 104-935); the mean leukocyte count reduction was 71%, corresponding to a mean absolute reduction of 219 × 10(9)  L(-1). No serious side effects were seen during or immediately after apheresis. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that our standardised technique for leukocytapheresis effectively reduced the peripheral blood leukaemia cell counts. Previous studies in AML also support the conclusion that this is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of a potentially life-threatening complication, but apheresis should always be combined with early chemotherapy.\n",
      "We have prospectively analysed and correlated the gene expression profiles of children presenting with acute leukaemia to the Royal London and Great Ormond Street Hospitals with morphological diagnosis, immunophenotype and karyotype. Total RNA extracted from freshly sorted blast cells was obtained from 84 lymphoblastic [acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)], 20 myeloid [acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)] and three unclassified acute leukaemias and hybridised to the high density Affymetrix U133A oligonucleotide array. Analysis of variance and significance analysis of microarrays was used to identify discriminatory genes. A novel 50-gene set accurately identified all patients with ALL and AML and predicted for a diagnosis of AML in three patients with unclassified acute leukaemia. A unique gene set was derived for each of eight subtypes of acute leukaemia within our data set. A common profile for children with ALL with an ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, amplification or deletion of ETV6, amplification of RUNX1 or hyperdiploidy with an additional chromosome 21 was identified. This suggests that these rearrangements share a commonality in biological pathways that maintains the leukaemic state. The gene TERF2 was most highly expressed in this group of patients. Our analyses demonstrate that not only is microarray analysis the single most effective tool for the diagnosis of acute leukaemias of childhood but it has the ability to identify unique biological pathways. To further evaluate its prognostic value it needs to be incorporated into the routine diagnostic analysis for large-scale clinical trials in childhood acute leukaemias.\n",
      "Recent progress in immunophenotyping includes the availability of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), knowledge of specificity and reactivity patterns of these reagents, and the technical improvements and standardization of immunofluorescence and immunocytology staining procedures, including flow cytometry. These advances have contributed significantly to the establishment of immunophenotyping as an essential diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis of types of acute leukaemia. Immunophenotyping allows for the objective and reproducible distinction of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) from acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and of T-lineage from B-lineage ALL. Immunologically defined ALL and AML subtypes have been found to convey prognostic significance. Using cell lineage-specific and differentiation stage-specific MAbs, cases of T- and B-lineage ALL and of AML can be further classified into a number of different subtypes. Routine immunophenotyping concentrates on the diagnostic enquiry into a few major, clinically relevant subtypes; only a limited number of crucial reagents are employed that are commercially available. The simplification and standardization of discriminatory immunomarker panels make immunophenotyping a reliable diagnostic instrument for the provision of critical data to make a differential diagnosis. An effort to identify the nature and origin of the blast cells precisely, immunological typing definitely plays an important part in the multiple-marker analysis of acute leukaemia (morphology, cytochemistry, karyotyping, genotyping) for applied diagnostic and fundamental research purposes.\n",
      "We have studied the immunological and cytogenetic features of 26 patients with acute leukaemia classified as biphenotypic according to a scoring system based on the number and lineage specificity of antigens expressed on the blast cells. The series included 19 adults (age >15 years) and seven children. The cases were distributed in four immunophenotypic groups: (1)coexpression of myeloid and B antigens, 18 cases (69 percent);(2)myeloid and T cell antigens, six (23 percent); (3) one case with trilineage differentiation; and (4) one case with coexpression of both B and T cell antigens. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal karyotype in four cases (15 percent) and abnormal clones in 22 (85 percent). Eight patients had the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11), (31 percent), three cases had structural aberrations of 6q and two had 11q23 rearrangements, one with t(11;19) and a second with t(4;11); the other eight cases had different alterations including t(9;12)(q1;q1), t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(2;7) (p1?3;q3?4), t(7;12)(q11;p11), hyperdiploidy and other structural abnormalities. The chromosomal rearrangements in children were characterised by abnormalities of 11q23 in two cases and the Ph translocation in three. Our data indicate that biphenotypic features are common in cases presenting with t(9;22) as the eight cases included here represent 47 percent of all cases of Ph+ve acute leukaemia studied in our Institution. Biphenotypic acute leukaemias comprise a heterogeneous group of leukaemias involving pluripotent stem cells. Cytogenetic studies are essential in characterising these cases as they will disclose several poor prognosis chromosome aberrations of which the Ph chromosome is the most frequent.\n",
      "In acute leukaemias there was a stable plateau in the survival curve at 45% after two years if grafted in first complete remission (n = 20) but only 13% of the patients are disease-free alive if grafted in a more advanced stage of the disease (n = 8). In 16 patients transplanted for chronic myeloid leukaemia the overall survival is 40%, in cases with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention by cyclosporine survival rate could be improved. Only 8 patients with severe aplastic anaemia, partially in low performance status were able to be transplanted; three died of infections, another by acute GVHD. The fatal complications in our study characterize the international well-known major problems in BMT: GVHD, interstitial pneumonitis, infections, graft failure in aplastic anaemia and recurrence of leukaemia, especially in more advanced leukaemia stage.\n",
      "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Firstly, to identify spatially close pairs and triplets of childhood leukaemias and cancers in Britain. Secondly, to compare pair frequencies with random expectations, identify excesses, and measure the diameters of any clusters. Thirdly, to infer possible causes. DESIGN AND SETTING: Stratified Poisson analyses of two comprehensive sets of childhood leukaemia and cancer data in Great Britain: seeking home address pairs within particular census enumeration districts (EDs) or postcodes (PCs). Numbers of pairs/triplets of leukaemia registrations sharing single or adjacent EDs were compared with Poisson, expectations in national ED strata with different numbers of households (HHs). Pairs/triplets of leukaemia/cancer deaths (and births) sharing a single PC were compared with Poisson expectations in national PC strata with different numbers of postal delivery points (DPs). Same and adjacent house pairs were identified individually among the same PC death pairs. Areal case densities were estimated around a sample of index cases, using their own PC grid coordinates, and those recorded in the central PC directory. PARTICIPANTS: These comprised, firstly, all cases of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma registered between 1966 and 1983 in England and Wales (ED analysis) and, secondly, all childhood leukaemia and cancer deaths between 1953 and 1980, in England, Wales, and Scotland (PC analyses at birth and at death). MAIN RESULTS: Short range spatial clustering was demonstrated (a) for leukaemia at place of registration, and (b) for leukaemia and cancer (separately and jointly) at both birth and death addresses. There was evidence of additional case pairing in adjacent PCs. Both data sets showed a relative local pair excess of about 1.5, within diameters of 300 metres. Secondary case densities, measured within 600 metres of a sample of unpaired index cases, were raised by the same ratio. The raised risk then tapered with increasing distance to about 3 km. Forty-four non-twin pairs had died at exactly the same address, far in excess of random expectation. This same house excess was due entirely to 31 sibling pairs. They also showed a relative excess of central nervous system and other solid tumours; but without the exact tumour type sibling concordances sometimes seen in MZ twins. The sibling pairs were only a small part of the overall excess of same PC pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Short range geographical clustering probably reflects two separate causes of childhood cancer, namely (a) an uncommon familial susceptibility to solid cancers, probably inherited, and (b) a group of long standing focal environmental hazards, most effective within a few hundred metres of the source, but detectable as far as 3 km.\n",
      "In order to test the hypothesis that glutathione (GSH) is an important determinant of treatment response in childhood acute leukaemia, blast cell GSH levels were studied in a cohort of children with acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and acute myeloid (AML) leukaemia. In both ALL and AML, several indicators of poor prognosis are well established but the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to resistant disease are still poorly understood. GSH is an intracellular thiol implicated in the development of cytotoxic drug resistance and appears to be involved in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, total GSH was measured in cryopreserved blasts from 62 childhood ALL and 13 AML patients. In ALL, high GSH levels were associated with a relatively poor prognosis. A positive correlation was demonstrated between the GSH level and presenting white cell count (WCC). GSH levels were significantly higher in T lineage ALL compared with B lineage and in AML blasts compared with ALL. These results are supportive of GSH as prognostic indicator in childhood leukaemia and may suggest one mechanism of treatment failure. They imply that it may be possible to improve chemosensitivity by the use of known modulators of GSH synthesis.\n",
      "Numerous immunophenotypic features have been examined for their potential prognostic significance in predicting treatment outcome in leukaemias. These include the immunophenotypic subgroups of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, only a few examples exist in developing Asian countries of the value of determining the immunologic characteristics of patients with ALL. The purpose of this study is to summarize the subtypes of ALL according to immunophenotypes recorded in previous reports in Thailand.A total of 263 documented cases were reviewed. Of these, 70, 42, 51, 10 and 90 patients had the phenotypes:- common, B, T, Null and Pre-B, respectively. The summative percentages for common, B, T, Null and Pre-B phenotypes are 26.6, 15.9, 19.4, 3.8 and 34.2%, respectively. According to this study, the three common phenotypes in general Thai ALL patients are Pre-B (34.2%), common (26.6%) and T (19.4%) phenotypes. After performing subtype analysis, the most common phenotypes among both adult and pediatric group is still Pre-B phenotype.\n",
      "The bone marrow (BM) is a complex organ located within the cavities of bones. The main function of the BM is to produce all the blood cells required for a normal healthy blood system. As with any major organ, many diseases can arise from errors in bone marrow function, including non-malignant disorders such as anaemia and malignant disorders such as leukaemias. This article will explore the role of the bone marrow, in normal and diseased haematopoiesis, with an emphasis on the requirement for intercellular mitochondrial transfer in leukaemia.\n",
      "In this study, blood samples were taken from 200 patients with childhood acute leukaemias, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and from 100 healthy volunteers (controls). The frequency of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1*04 allele was significantly higher, and the frequencies of the HLA-A23 and HLA-B7 antigens were significantly lower, in patients with ALL compared with controls. Among patients with AML, the frequency of the HLA-B49 antigen and the HLA-DRB1*15 allele were significantly higher, whereas the frequencies of the HLA-A11 and HLA-B38 antigens were significantly lower compared with controls. The frequency of the HLA-DRB1*04 allele was also significantly higher in male patients with ALL and AML, whereas the HLA-DRB1*13 allele was found significantly less frequently in male AML and female ALL patients than in controls. To date, this is the only study to evaluate the associations between HLA molecules and leukaemia in a Turkish population with acute childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "The demonstration of a statistical association between paternal preconceptional irradiation and childhood leukaemia appeared to provide a satisfactory explanation for the excess of cases in the village of Seascale, close to the Sellafield nuclear installation, and became the basis of two legal claims for compensation. In the ensuing scientific debate the biological plausibility of a causal interpretation of this association focused on the heritability of leukaemia and a comparison of the genetic risks implied by this finding with current information on the induction of genetic damage by irradiation. After a wide ranging review of the mechanistic issues it is concluded that there is no genetic basis for a causal relationship and this, together with recent appraisals of epidemiological studies, suggests that the association between childhood leukaemia and paternal preconceptional irradiation exposure is most likely to be a chance finding.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: Established risk factors for leukaemia do not explain the majority of leukaemia cases. Previous studies have suggested the importance of occupation and related exposures in leukaemogenesis. We evaluated possible associations between job title and selected hazardous agents and leukaemia in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. METHODS: The mean follow-up time for 241 465 subjects was 11.20 years (SD 2.42 years). During the follow-up period, 477 incident cases of myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia occurred. Data on 52 occupations considered a priori to be at high risk of developing cancer were collected through standardised questionnaires. Occupational exposures were estimated by linking the reported occupations to a job exposure matrix. Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the association between occupation and related exposures and risk of leukaemia. RESULTS: The risk of lymphoid leukaemia significantly increased for working in chemical laboratories (HR 8.35, 95% CI 1.58 to 44.24), while the risk of myeloid leukaemia increased for working in the shoe or other leather goods industry (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.28 to 5.06). Exposure-specific analyses showed a non-significant increased risk of myeloid leukaemias for exposure to benzene (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.40; HR=1.60, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.69 for the low and high exposure categories, respectively). This association was present both for acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia at high exposure levels. However, numbers were too small to reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a possible role of occupational exposures in the development of both lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia. Exposure to benzene seemed to be associated with both acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "Lack of sufficient cellular activity of asparagine synthetase (AS) in blast cells compared with normal tissue is thought to be the basis of the antileukaemic effect of L-asparaginase in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Although L-asparaginase is routinely used in ALL, its role and value in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) is still being discussed. To evaluate the pharmacological basis for L-asparaginase treatment, we established pretreatment monitoring of the intracellular AS activity in blast cells of patients with AML and ALL. There was no general difference in AS activity between ALL and AML samples. Significantly lower AS activity, however, was found in the B-lineage ALL subgroups as well as AML-M5.\n",
      "The aim of this work was to examine whether the risk of death i.a. due to haemorrhage into the central nervous system (CNS) is higher during some phases of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and the blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (BP) when two important risk factors that worsen the prognosis are simultaneously present: low thrombocytopenia and hyperleukocytosis. Clinical and post-mortem neuropathological examination was performed in 143 patients, aged 17-76 years, who died from AML (80 cases), BP (38), and ALL (25). Periods with co-existence of thrombocytopenia below 25 x 10(9) per l and hyperleukocytosis above 100 x 10(9) per l were identified after plotting the results and were termed the 'critical period' (CP). The study showed that the risk of death was disproportionately high during the CP. This finding was obtained in all patient groups, although it involved mainly patients with AML and BP, i.e. leukaemias with the highest frequency of hyperleukocytosis in peripheral blood. It is suggested that the risk of death during the CP is so high because leukaemic cells are a potent synergistic factor to thrombocytopenia in causing CNS haemorrhage. When a CP is detected, hyperleukocytosis and thrombocytopenia should be controlled and treated aggressively: leukapheresis and platelet concentrates should be administered. Patients with CP should not be given packed red blood cells, in order to avoid a further increase in blood viscosity, which is already high due to hyperleukocytosis. In fact, anaemia during the CP should be regarded as a potentially life-saving factor.\n",
      "Here we report 3 cases of trisomy 11 observed in 1 patient with secondary acute myeloblastic leukaemia and in 2 patients with spontaneous acute myeloblastic leukaemia. In all 3 patients, the picture of overt acute leukaemia arose following a clinically established myelodysplastic syndrome. These findings, together with the previously reported occurrence of trisomy 11 in myelodysplastic syndrome and in acute myeloblastic leukaemia, suggest that this abnormality can be considered specifically associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and with the subsequent and related acute myeloblastic leukaemia.\n",
      "Using an ultrastructural immunogold method, we performed a quantitative study on cellular lysozyme (LZ) content in young normal bone marrow cells and in 14 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) of the M2, M3, M4 and M5 types. In five cases of M2 we found significantly lower LZ content than in normal promyelocytes and than in nine cases of M3, M4 and M5. In M3, M4 and M5 cells a very high LZ content was observed whereas the serum LZ activity was high in M4 and M5 and normal in M3. The intragranular LZ content was especially high in M5 and in most granules of M4 cells. The immunogold reaction (IGR) for LZ was also performed in cells previously reacted for myeloperoxidase (MPO). In M2 the granules showed definite positive MPO reactivity and low LZ density (granulocytic pattern), whereas in M5 we found high granular LZ content and weak or almost negative MPO activity (monocytic pattern). In M4 we found 'granulocytic' and 'monocytic' type of granules in the same cell. The IGR for LZ performed in post-embedded M5 cells which were previously subjected to phagocytosis of latex particles, showed granules that had moved toward the phagosome, releasing LZ without degranulation. The above findings and those showing normal serum LZ in M3 despite their high cellular LZ content, definitely indicate that only leukaemic M4 and M5 cells secrete LZ into their environment, explaining the high serum LZ observed in those leukaemias.\n",
      "A 68-year-old Caucasian male presented with a 5-week history of a widespread pruritic papular eruption. Histology from a papule on the left shoulder showed a dense dermal infiltrate of large mononuclear cells which were positive for leucocyte common antigen, KP1 and PGM1, with an MIB-1 proliferating fraction of 40%, diagnostic of acute monocytic (M5) leukaemia cutis. Full blood count revealed pancytopaenia but no blasts. Bone marrow aspirate showed reduced red cell precursors and 10% blasts, consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anaemia with excess blasts). The patient was managed with a 3 unit transfusion of packed red cells, after which his skin eruption resolved within 6 weeks and his peripheral blood counts returned to normal. No chemotherapy was administered. In conclusion, leukaemia can present in the skin, the eruption may be nonspecific and it may precede systemic involvement by either myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukaemia.\n",
      "Allogeneic BMT is treatment of choice for acute leukaemias(AL) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL). In the period form 1989 till 1997 36 allogeneic BMT have been performed for patients with AML, ALL and CGL using HLA matched related donors in University Medical Centre Ljubljana. The procedure was successful in 80% of patients with CGL and in 50% of patients with AL. The most frequent cause of death in CGL patients was CMV pneumonitis, relapse in patients transplanted for ALL, while in patients transplanted for AML beside relapse we observed four deaths due to complications of BMT ( acute GVHD, VOD, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, liver failure due to hepatitis).\n",
      "Acute leukemia is the most common type of childhood and adolescence cancer, characterized by clonal proliferation of variably differentiated myeloid or lymphoid precursors. Recent insights into the molecular pathogenesis of leukemia have shown that epigenetic modifications, such as deacetylation of histones and DNA methylation, play crucial roles in leukemogenesis, by transcriptional silencing of critical genes. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are potential targets in the treatment of leukaemia, and, as a consequence, inhibitors of HDACs (HDIs) are being studied for therapeutic purposes. HDIs promote or enhance several different anticancer mechanisms, such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and cellular differentiation and, therefore, are in evidence as promising treatment for children and adolescents with acute leukemia, in monotherapy or in association with other anticancer drugs. Here we review the main preclinical and clinical studies regarding the use of HDIs in treating childhood and adolescence leukemia.\n",
      "In most cases, childhood leukaemia has a fetal origin, but multiple molecular events are required after birth for pre-leukaemic cells to progress to leukaemia. Cure rates for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) now approach 80%. A high level of minimal residual disease detected by polymerase chain reaction in patients with ALL in remission has profound prognostic importance and is the focus of a major Australian study attempting to prevent relapse in these children. Greater awareness of the late effects of chemotherapy has led to changes in the treatment protocols for ALL, with improvement in neurocognitive outcomes and reduced rates of second malignancies. Pharmacogenetics is a new field of research that aims to enhance treatment efficacy by assessing the individual metabolism of and response to chemotherapeutic agents. Targeted therapies currently being developed show some promise of being able to further improve cure rates. Adolescents with ALL have a better prognosis if treated with paediatric rather than adult protocols.\n",
      "Mitozantrone (MTZ; Novantrone), 1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis-[(2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethyl]amino)-9,10- anthracenedione dihydrochloride (NSC 302739), is a synthetic anthracenedione with intercalating properties. Activity has been shown in preclinical studies in mice bearing intraperitoneal P388 and L1210 leukaemias and a variety of solid tumours. Three sequential studies to examine the activity, toxicity and scheduling of MTZ in acute leukaemia or chronic granulocytic leukaemia in myeloid transformation were undertaken in relapsed and/or refractory disease in patients up to the age of 70. Single-dose treatment up to 32 mg/m2 showed little activity but in a 5-day schedule (10 mg/m2/day) MTZ gave a 24% complete remission rate in relapsed and/or resistant acute leukaemia. In a phase III study in which MTZ was given in a similar schedule combined with a 7-day infusion of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C; 100 mg/m2/day), 68% of patients were rendered leukaemia-free. In studies from other centres, similar very encouraging results have been obtained where MTZ has been combined with high-dose Ara-C or VP16/213.\n",
      "The very rapid development of techniques based on use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for characterizing molecular lesions in leukaemia and lymphoma mow offers the opportunity for monitoring residual disease at a sensitivity of one malignant cell in 10(5) or 10(6) normal cells. Maximal specificity is achieved when the DNA sequences amplified are truly leukaemia-specific (i.e. BCR/ABL in CML, PML/RAR-alfa in APL, AML1/ETO in t(8; 21) AML and CBFB/MYH1 in inv(16) AML). A good level of sensitivity may also be achieved by using immunoglobin heavy chain (IGH) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements if a clonospecific probe can be generated. For clinical purposes the crucial issues are the following: can PCR techniques be used for confirmation of diagnosis and evaluation of extent of disease? Can PCR data obtained be developed to quantitate the PCR product and thereby increase its predictive value? These and other issues are still a matter of debate and several studies are presently in progress to address these points.\n",
      "A case control study of Scottish children aimed to identify risk factors for leukaemia and other cancers operating in the prenatal environment, during delivery and neonatally. Cases (0-14 years) were age-and sex- matched to two population-based controls and details abstracted from the mother hospital obstetric notes. Analyses of 144 leukaemias (124 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL)), 45 lymphomas, 75 central nervous system (CNS) tumours and 126 'other solid tumours' were conducted using conditional logistic regression. The presence of a neonatal infection significantly reduced the risk of ALL (odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-0.95), particularly in 0- to 4-year-olds. Positive swab tests confirmed 47% of ALL cases with any infection and 46% of controls. This is consistent with the hypothesis that early exposure to infections may reduce the risk of childhood ALL. Asphyxia at birth significantly increased the risk of leukaemia, which was accounted for by ALL. For the 'other solid tumours' higher levels of maternal education were inversely associated with risk (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.94) but positively associated with antibiotics (OR 2.16 95% CI 1.10-4.25) and respiratory tract infections (OR 14.1, 95% CI 1.76-113.7) in pregnancy. No obvious plausible patterns of risk were detected either within or across disease subgroups.\n",
      "The valuability of immunophenotyping of acute myeloid and lymphoid leukaemias in comparison to morphological and cytochemical classification were approached in 56 cases. In the case of acute myeloid leukaemias the immunophenotyping by monoclonal antibodies CD14, CD13, CD33 was less informative concerning the subtypes of the disease. The clinical diagnosis can be achieved on the basis of cytochemical investigation alone. In contrast, the diagnosis of lymphoid leukaemias requires all information obtained by immunophenotyping by a series of monoclonal antibodies CD3, CD2, CD4, CD8, CD1, CD19, CD20, CD21 and CD10. On the other hand, the monoclonal antibodies are essential in differentiation of the very immature myeloid and lymphoid leukaemias. This is of great importance from the clinical point of view for determining the therapy. Molecular genetic studies based on the characterisation of the state of gene rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor beta chains have basic importance in the confirmation of the result of immunophenotyping and in the determination of leukaemias of unknown origin.\n",
      "A 49-year-old woman presented with a 1-year-history of a widespread eruption which proved to be due to leukaemia cutis. Subsequently, she developed pancytopaenia and a bone marrow biopsy revealed refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) with a high monoblastic component. This transformed into acute myeloid leukaemia. Leukaemia cutis in this context is well described but in this patient it became manifest 1 year prior to referral to the dermatologist. When occurring with a myelodysplastic syndrome, leukaemia cutis often heralds malignant transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia. Prompt diagnosis in this situation may identify a group of high-risk patients with myelodysplastic syndrome for whom chemotherapy and allogenic bone marrow transplantation, rather than the more conventional approach of supportive treatment, could be a more appropriate management strategy.\n",
      "We describe a case of neonatal mixed lineage leukaemia which presented with a dominant B progenitor lymphoblast population plus a minor monocytic component. Treatment of the patient with corticosteroid and Ara-C resulted in loss of lymphoblasts and a rapid (within 7 days) increase and dominance of the monocytic component. The common clonal origin of the two cell types was evident from the identical rearrangement in the MLL gene and a shared rearrangement of one IGH allele. In common with other neonatal or infant ALL with MLL gene rearrangements, this leukaemia may have originated in a common B-monocytic lineage stem cell during foetal haemopoiesis. The observations further suggest that the therapeutic impact of the MLL gene rearrangement is to some extent dependent on the cellular context in which it is expressed.\n",
      "Increased incidences of childhood acute leukaemia were noted among survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In Western societies, Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia has a distinct epidemiology peaking at 3 years old. Exposure to ionising radiation is an established hazard but it is difficult to gauge the precise risk of less than 100 mSv. Since 1983 significant leukaemia incidences have been reported among families residing near nuclear installations. The target cells (naïve neonatal lymphocytes) get exposed to multiple xenobiotic challenges and undergo extraordinary proliferation and physiological somatic genetic change. Population movements and ionising radiation are considered taking account of updated understanding of radiation biology, cancer cytogenetics and immunological diversity. Double Strand Breaks in DNA arise through metabolic generation of Reactive Oxygen Species, and nearly always are repaired; but mis-repairs can be oncogenic. Recombinant Activating Gene enzymes in rapidly dividing perinatal pre-B lymphocytes being primed for antibody diversity are targeted to Signal Sequences in the Immunoglobulin genes. off target pseudo-sequences may allow RAG enzymes to create autosomal DSBs which, when mis-repaired, become translocated oncogenes. Immunogens acting by chance at crucial stages may facilitate this. In such circumstances, oncogenic DSBs from ionising radiation are less likely to be significant.\n",
      "The proliferation of mammalian cells requires nucleosides which are provided either by de novo synthesis or by influx of nucleosides via membrane transporters with subsequent metabolic trapping. In this study the density of nucleoside transporters in freshly-isolated blast cells from patients with leukaemias and lymphomas was quantitated by equilibrium binding of 3H-nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR). In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) the density of NBMPR binding sites on blast cells ranged from 3800 to 24,200 sites/cell and this value correlated with the 3H-thymidine labelling index (1-20%) which was used to measure proliferative rate (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001). Cells from patients with Burkitt lymphoma, other B-cell lymphomas, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma and large cell lymphoma gave a 20-fold range of NBMPR site densities (from 3700 to 75,300 sites/cell) and site numbers correlated closely with the labelling index (r = 0.87, P less than 0.001). Non-proliferating cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia expressed the lowest density of NBMPR binding sites (850-2900 sites/cell). Comparison of bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts confirmed the positive correlation between NBMPR binding sites and labelling index for four individual patients. In contrast, the density of NBMPR binding sites on lymphoblasts from non-T acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was low (2300-7400 sites/cell) and showed little dependence on proliferation over a wide range of labelling indices (1-20%). No correlation was observed between NBMPR site density and cell size measured by the intracellular water space. Thus an increased proliferative rate of AML or lymphoma is associated with higher numbers of nucleoside transporters in the cell membrane.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The use of tissue microarrays (TMAs) is now a generally accepted method for the investigation of solid tumours. However, little is known about the applicability of the TMA technique for analysis of patients with acute leukaemia. A bone marrow (BM)-TMA analysis with 15 different immunohistochemical markers was performed. The TMA was validated by comparison with the corresponding full tissue sections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A BM-TMA comprising 148 cases of acute leukaemia, including 115 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 33 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases, was constructed. Expression of CD3, CD10, CD15, CD20, CD34, CD61, CD68, CD79a, CD99, CD117, CD138, myeloperoxidase, haemoglobin A1, glycophorin and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was immunohistochemically analysed. 50 cases of the TMA were directly compared with the corresponding full tissue section to validate the results. RESULTS: Morphologically and immunohistochemically, 6 (4%) of 148 cases and 765 (11%) cores of 6912 individual analyses were not evaluable. A direct comparison of TMA cases with conventional full sections showed a concordance of the results of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The small size of bone-marrow biopsies and the presence of bony trabeculae do not preclude construction and analysis of acute leukaemia TMAs. Acute leukaemia cases on TMA displayed the characteristic phenotypic profiles expected in different AML and ALL subtypes. Therefore, the TMA technique is also a promising method for high-throughput analysis of combined marker expression and clinicopathological correlations in patients with leukaemia.\n",
      "One hundred and ninety well-characterized acute and chronic leukaemias were studied for the expression of CD1a antigen by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). CD1a was detected on 28 per cent of mature B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, 26 per cent of acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemias (ANLL), 21 per cent of chronic granulocytic leukaemias in blast crisis (CML-BC), 53 percent of T acute lymphocytic leukaemias (T-ALL) and in only one out of 35 common acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (c-ALL). In some cases the expression of the CD1a antigen on the surface of leukaemic cells showed a spontaneous fluctuation after a short period of incubation in vitro. CD1b and CD1c molecules were also detected on B cells and acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemias. The presence of CD1 antigens was confirmed using a dot blot assay (DBA) on the lysate of leukaemic cells.\n",
      "Familial myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has been claimed to account for as many as one third of children with MDS, especially among those showing monosomy 7. The present study is the first to provide population-based estimates of the risk of haematological and other malignancies in relatives of children with MDS. The study was extended to include children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The index group consisted of 46 children with MDS, 62 with AML, and eight with CML, which is thought to represent all myeloid leukaemias in Danish children, 1980-91. By linkage to the Central Population Register we identified parents (230), siblings (231), grandparents (151), aunts and uncles (132) and cousins (140). Information on the cancer incidence was obtained from the Danish Cancer Registry. 27 cancers were observed versus 26.7 expected (relative risk 1.0). Leukaemia in relatives was observed in only one family. None of 11 children with MDS and monosomy 7 had family members affected by leukaemia. We found no evidence of an increased overall risk of cancer in the relatives. The risk of familial MDS may be considerably lower than previously estimated.\n",
      "The Wilms' tumour gene (WT1) has been suggested as a powerful parameter for molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in leukaemias. However, molecular monitoring via WT1 RNA levels is far from being routinely performed, which is possibly owing to the complex and inaccurate quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedures. Using a newly-developed quantitative real time RT-PCR, we measured WT1 transcripts in peripheral blood leucocytes of patients with acute myeloid (AML), acute lymphoid (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). While healthy blood donors did not show measurable amounts of WT1 transcripts, WT1 RNA levels were detectable in all types of leukaemia. Furthermore, intraindividual WT1 transcript kinetics were exclusively dependent on disease progression, treatment and subsequent disease outcome. Using this approach, we could distinguish between treatment response and failure within the first days of therapeutic intervention. Moreover, gradually rising WT1 levels over a period of weeks and months paralleled long-term disease progression and appeared to be a prognostic indicator for subsequent clinical relapse. A linear correlation between quantities of WT1 and bcr/abl fusion transcripts could be seen in CML. We conclude that quantitative assessment of WT1 transcripts using real-time PCR is an appropriate method for molecular monitoring of AML, ALL and CML, and can be used independently for both short- and long-term monitoring of leukaemia patients.\n",
      "Mortality from leukaemia under age 25 was studied in British New Towns to test the hypothesis that leukaemia represents a rare response to a much commoner (but unrecognised) infection, the transmission of which is facilitated when large numbers of people come together. The density of children was higher in the rural, but lower in the overspill, New Towns than in the areas from which their incomers originated. Residents of the rural New Towns had greater diversity of origin than those of the overspill towns of London and Glasgow. These two factors would encourage a greater rise in the postulated underlying infection in the rural towns, and in these a significant excess of leukaemia at ages 0-4 was found in 1946-65. In both sets of towns there was a significant deficit in other age groups consistent with immunising effects of the relevant infection. There are parallels with feline leukaemia virus infection, in which contrasting leukaemogenic and immunising effects occur in different social settings owing mainly to differences in intensity of viral exposure.\n",
      "Using Northern-blot analysis we have studied the expression of T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha, beta and gamma chain genes in primary cells obtained from 36 leukaemic patients. Fifteen patients had myeloid leukaemias, two had T-cell leukaemias, and 19 leukaemias corresponding to various stages of B-lymphocyte differentiation. We observed that truncated TCR beta mRNAs were produced in B-cells at relatively high levels even in the absence of detectable gene rearrangements. Ti alpha mRNAs of abnormal size were also frequently found. Such transcripts were not detectable in total RNA extracted from leukaemic myeloid cells. Factors allowing Ti alpha and beta gene transcription must be active in leukaemic pre-B and B cells but not in myeloid cells. Neither B-lineage nor myeloid leukaemias expressed TCR gamma gene at detectable levels.\n",
      "Since leukaemia-specific leucocyte antigen has not been identified to date, the immunological diagnosis of leukaemia is achieved through the application of a wide set of monoclonal antibodies specific for surface markers on leukaemic cells. Thus, the interpretation of leukaemia immunophenotype seems to be a mathematically determined comparison of 'what we found' and 'what we know' about it. The objective of this study was to establish an algorithm for transformation of empirical rules into mathematical values to achieve proper decisions. Recognition of leukaemia phenotype was performed by comparison of phenotyping data with reference data, followed by scoring of such comparisons. Systematic scoring resulted in the formation of new numerical variables allocated to each state, whereas a most significant variable was described as a complex measure of compatibility. A system of recognized states was described by mathematical variables measuring the confidence of information systems, i.e. maximal, total and relative entropy. The entire algorithm was derived by matrix algebra and coded in a high-level program language. The list of the states recognized appeared to be especially helpful in differential diagnosis, occasionally pointing to states that had not been in the scientist mind at the start of the analysis.\n",
      "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single-stranded RNAs that have a potentially important role in gene regulation. Using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay specific to the mature miRNA, the expression level of a selected group of haematopoietic tissue-specific miRNAs was measured across a set of 30 primary adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with a normal karyotype. The expression levels of each miRNA were correlated with the genome-wide mRNA expression profiles in the same leukaemias. This revealed that miR-181a correlated strongly with the AML morphological sub-type and with the expression of genes previously identified through sequence analysis as potential interaction targets. Three other miRNAs, miR-10a, miR-10b and miR-196a-1, showed a clear correlation with HOX gene expression.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of leukaemias and lymphomas in children according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer third edition (ICCC-3) in the population covered by the Girona, Valencia, and Zaragoza population-based cancer registries and compare it with the incidence rates in other European countries. All haematological malignancies (HMs) registered between 1993 and 2002 in children below 15 years of age were included in the study. Pathological and haematological diagnoses were reviewed, recoded according to International Classification of Diseases for Oncology-3 and reclassified on the basis of ICCC-3. Sex and age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated, using the world population as standard. Five hundred and seventy-one HMs were registered in the Girona, Valencia and Zaragoza Cancer Registries during the study period. According to ICCC-3, precursor cell leukaemias were the most frequent HMs in children and constituted 60% of all HMs (an age-adjusted incidence rate of 42.7 per million children-years). The second most frequent childhood HM was Hodgkin lymphoma (11.2% of all HMs), yielding an age-adjusted standardized incidence rate of 6.3 per million children-years. With regard to myeloid lineage, acute myeloid leukaemias were the most frequent with a rate of 7.9 per million children-years. The standardized incidence rates for lymphoid leukaemia (1.19) and Burkitt lymphoma (3.94) were statistically higher than the rates observed in Europe. Compared with European data, Spain has a high incidence of lymphoid leukaemias and lymphomas. In particular, a high incidence of Burkitt lymphoma was observed. The causes of this geographical variation are still unknown.\n",
      "Thirty four out of 750 patients entered into the Medical Research Council (MRC) 9th Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Trial had more than 1% basophils (range 1-27%) often with bizarre granulation and primitive forms, a rare finding in this disease. Both normal and abnormal karyotypes were present including abnormalities of 6p, 12p, and the Philadelphia chromosome. Basophilia was found in both \"monolineage\" and \"multilineage\" leukaemias and the commonest French-American-British (FAB) classification group was M2, followed by M4. Basophilia did not seem to be associated with a worse prognosis, although cases with abnormalities of 6p died of disease that was resistant to first line conventional chemotherapy.\n",
      "Sera from an epidemiological case-control study of leukaemias and lymphomas conducted between 1980 and 1986 were examined for reactivity to human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Statistical analyses of the data revealed higher HHV-6 seroprevalence and antibody titres in the cases, particularly evident in the disease subtypes acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin disease (HD), and low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Within the control group alone, HHV-6 seroprevalence was placed at 55% at a serum dilution of 1:40. The controls also displayed higher seropositivity in females as compared with males. Further analyses suggest an association of increased HHV-6 seropositivity and geometric mean titre ratio with HD among young adults lacking social contact in the family group. This finding might indicate late exposure to HHV-6 in such persons and could possibly signify late exposure to a number of viruses, including those hypothesized as playing a role in the aetiology of HD. Previous reports have nominated Epstein-Barr virus as a possible candidate. Our results suggest that HHV-6 should be included in further investigations of the aetiology of HD.\n",
      "Mature T-cell malignancies of extracutaneous origin are rare disorders. T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is the most common form of all mature T-cell leukaemias in adults. Secondary skill involvement by T-PLL has been reported in 25% of patients. A case of T-PLL which presented with cutaneous infiltration mimicking a cellulitis-like lesion resistant to antibiotic therapy is described. The diagnosis of T-PLL was subsequently fully supported by the clinical, laboratory and cytological findings, as well as by the immunophenotypic study of the skin biopsy. The present case stresses the importance of accurate evaluation of skin lesions in the diagnosis of some haematological conditions and gives additional information about T-PLL such as a previously non-reported cytogenetic abnormality [t(6;6)] and lack of cutaneous lymphocytic-associated antigen expression.\n",
      "Bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) is the etiological agent of chronic lymphatic leukaemia/lymphoma in cows, sheep and goats. Infection without neoplastic transformation was also obtained in pigs, rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, rabbits and observed in capybaras and water-buffaloes. Structurally and functionally, BLV is a relative of human T lymphotropic viruses 1 and 2 (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) In humans, HTLV-I induces a T-cell leukaemia and its type 2 counterpart has been found in dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, hairy T-cell leukaemia and prolymphocytic leukaemia cases. At variance with HTLV-I, BLV has not been associated with neurological diseases of the degenerative type. Bovine leukaemia virus, HTLV-I and HTLV-II show clearcut sequence homologies. The pathology of the BLV-induced disease, most notably the absence of chronic viraemia, a long latency period and lack of preferred proviral integration sites in tumours, is similar to that of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma induced by HTLV-I. The most striking feature of these three naturally transmitted leukaemia viruses is the X region located between the env gene and the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence. The X region contains several overlapping long open reading frames. One of them, designated XBL-I, encodes a trans-activator function capable of increasing the level of gene expression directed by BLV-LTR and most probably is involved in \"genetic instability\" of BLV-infected cells of the B cell lineage. The \"genetic instability\" renders the infected cell susceptible to move, along a number of stages, towards full malignancy. Little is known about these events and their causes; we present some theoretical possibilities. Bovine leukaemia virus infection has a worldwide distribution. In temperate climates, the virus spreads mostly via iatrogenic transfer of infected lymphocytes. In warm climates and in areas heavily populated by haematophagous insects, there are indications of insect-borne propagation of the virus.\n",
      "Whereas individual cost-effectiveness analyses of new agents for acute leukaemia should be performed in target populations, any meaningful pharmacoeconomic evaluation of treatment options for this condition should include the many types of costs and outcomes in unselected, representative groups of patients. Both direct costs (e.g. costs for medication and hospitalisation) and indirect costs (e.g. lost productivity costs and reduced quality of life) are important parameters to assess, as are the costs of chronic adverse effects, research and development costs for new agents, and costs of procedure-related deaths. Complete remission, cure and survival are the uccess' response criteria for acute leukaemia treatments, in addition to prolonged life with acceptable quality of life for patients with incurable acute leukaemia. Death is 'failure', caused either by resistant disease (relapse and progressive disease) inspite of optimal chemotherapy or, sometimes, by insufficient treatment. All of these parameters should be taken into account when a pharmacoeconomic evaluation is performed (either for administrative or scientific purposes) in order to ensure a comprehensive and reliable background for the evaluation in question. Treatment of acute leukaemia is expensive with a total cost of about $US3000 per patient per day during the induction. Although 80% of children with acute leukaemia are cured, only less than 50% of adults are cured. Thus, a great cost is associated with death during treatment and only optimal medical treatment with full-scale combination chemotherapy and full supportive treatment can keep the number of deaths to a minimum.\n",
      "The demonstration of the BCR-ABL fusion gene in patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia and t(9;22)(q34;q11) represents the first recognition, in a human neoplasm, of a translocation leading to formation of an oncogenic fusion gene. Since this initial observation, this leukaemogenic mechanism has been increasingly recognized in chronic myeloid leukaemias. The fusion gene has often incorporated part of a gene encoding a receptor or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, particularly ABL, PDGFRB and FGFR1. This contrasts with the frequent involvement of genes encoding transcription factors or other nuclear proteins in acute myeloid leukaemia. Nevertheless, genes encoding tyrosine kinases have also been implicated in some cases of acute leukaemia. With the exception of the BCR-ABL fusion gene in chronic granulocytic leukaemia, all these fusion genes are uncommon or rare among cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia. The molecular mechanisms underlying the great majority of cases of Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloid leukaemia remain to be discovered.\n",
      "Dynamic interactions between leukaemic cells and cells of the bone marrow are a feature of haematological malignancies. Two distinct microenvironmental niches in the bone marrow, the 'osteoblastic (endosteal)' and 'vascular' niches, provide a sanctuary for subpopulations of leukaemic cells to evade chemotherapy-induced death and allow acquisition of drug resistance. Key components of the bone marrow microenvironment as a home for normal haematopoietic stem cells and the leukaemia stem cell niches, and the molecular pathways critical for microenvironment/leukaemia interactions via cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules as well as hypoxic conditions, are described in this review. Finally, the genetic abnormalities of leukaemia-associated stroma are discussed. Further understanding of the contribution of the bone marrow niche to the process of leukaemogenesis may provide new targets that allow destruction of leukaemia stem cells without adversely affecting normal stem cell self-renewal.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a life-threatening haematopoietic disease that is characterized by clonal growth and the accumulation of myelopoietic progenitor cells. Although AML cells only have a limited potential to undergo differentiation and maturation, each AML clone is organized in a hierarchical manner similar to normal haematopoiesis. Recent data have shown that each AML clone consists of leukaemic stem cells and their progeny, and that AML stem cells differ from more mature cells in several aspects, including survival and target antigen profiles. Most importantly, AML stem cells, but not their progeny, have the capacity to repopulate haematopoietic tissues with leukaemias in NOD/SCID mice. Furthermore, AML stem cells are thought to be responsible for the infinite growth of leukaemias in patients with AML. The phenotypic properties of AML stem cells have also been described. In most cases, these cells are detectable within the CD34+, CD38-, Lin-, CD123+ subpopulation of AML cells. Because of their AML-initiating and -renewing capacity and their unique phenotype, which includes several molecular targets of drug therapy, AML stem cells have recently been proposed as novel important target cell populations in the context of curative therapies. The present article gives an overview of our knowledge about AML stem cells, their phenotype, and their role as a 'therapy-target' in new concepts to treat and to cure patients with AML.\n",
      "We reviewed Dutch patients and those described in the literature with congenital leukaemia in the past 25 years, with the intention to obtain an overview of the characteristics of this rare disease. Among the 117 patients reviewed, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was more frequent (64%) than acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, 21%). Most patients had a high leukaemic cell load with hepatosplenomegaly, leukaemia cutis and hyperleucocytosis. Cytogenetic abnormalities were found in the majority of the patients tested (72%); 11q23 abnormalities were found in less than half of them (42%). The probability of overall survival at 24 months was only 23%. When congenital AML and ALL were compared, clinical characteristics and overall survival were not significantly different. However, in patients at risk, the probability of event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were significantly higher in AML than in ALL, 43% versus 13% and 68% versus 0% respectively. Among the congenital AML cases, six spontaneous remissions have been described. In conclusion, the clinical characteristics of congenital leukaemia differ from those of leukaemia in older children and prognosis is generally poor. Once complete remission is achieved, patients with AML fare better than those with ALL. Chemotherapy for congenital leukaemia needs improvement to increase the sustained remission rate.\n",
      "Rarer chronic lymphoid leukaemias represent a challenge to the clinicians due to the limited information on their pathogenesis, difficulties on setting up prospective clinical trials and to their refractoriness to drugs used in the most common form of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In this review all these issues are addressed in three B-cell leukaemias: B-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-PLL), hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and HCL-variant and three T-cell leukaemias: T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia (T-cell LGLL) and adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma (ATLL). Data will be presented on the natural history, current therapies and emerging drugs potentially useful in the treatment of patients with these leukaemias. Emphasis is made on: 1- the novel agents targeting a variety of B and T-cell antigens expressed on the surface of the leukaemic cells; these are either unconjugated monoclonal antibodies (McAb) such as Rituximab (anti-CD20), the second and third generation of anti-CD20 McAbs, Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52), Siplizumab (anti-CD2), Daclizumab (anti-CD25) and KW-0761, an anti-chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) or McAbs conjugated to toxins such as CD22 linked to the pseudomonas exotoxin or radiolabelled McAb; 2- the use of new purine nucleosides such as nelarabine and 3- agents targeting deregulated genes in the leukaemic cells from these diseases such as the Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) Olarapib in T-PLL with deregulation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. Data of phase I and II clinical studies with these agents as well as the potential and current use of other drugs are outlined.\n",
      "B-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (BPLL) is a haematological malignancy defined as lymphocytosis and splenomegaly with >55% circulating cells being clonal prolymphocytes of B-cell origin. The evolution of this disease is more aggressive than chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We reported a case of a 62-year-old man with BPLL who, on treatment, attained cytological, immunophenotypic and complete cytogenetic remission. He subsequently developed an asymmetric sensorimotor neurological disorder, suggestive of lymphomatous infiltration (neurolymphocytosis). Repetition of the MRI and the electromyography was essential for diagnosis. Progressive mononeuritis multiplex in B-cell leukaemias/lymphomas is rare and may be the only presenting symptom of relapsed or progressive disease. Repeat imaging studies based on judicious evaluation of the clinical scenario for exclusion of other causes of neurological symptoms is necessary. This can be challenging in patients with long-standing malignancies who have received multiple courses of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.\n",
      "Four patients with acute myeloid leukaemia relapsed within 6 months of allogeneic BMT. Three patients were treated with cytosine arabinoside and amsacrine while the fourth received no chemotherapy. All patients received infusions of leucocytes obtained by repeated leukapheresis from the original bone marrow donor. Three patients developed GVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy. One of these achieved a complete remission which has been sustained for more than 1 year with 100% donor haematopoiesis. The other patients died with persistent leukaemia 45-134 days after the infusions of donor cells. We conclude that the addition of marrow donor leucocytes to salvage chemotherapy may produce durable remissions in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia relapsing after BMT and that this may be due to a graft-versus-leukaemia effect.\n",
      "Despite their common origin from the B-cell mature lymphoid system, small B-cell lymphomas/leukaemias represent in fact an heterogeneous group of diseases. Recent advances in immunohistochemistry and molecular techniques have improved our knowledge of the immune system and lymphoid neoplasms. An international consensus has been recently reached among pathologists and clinicians, that recognises clinico-pathological entities which are defined by a combination of morphological, immunophenotypical, genetic and clinical features. In each entity, a range of histological grade and clinical aggressiveness can be encountered. Recognition of these entities, combined with clinical prognostic factors has clinical implications in terms of response to treatment and prognosis. The purpose of this paper is to focus on a practical approach, either clinical or pathological, of the diagnosis of small B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia.\n",
      "The expression of two myeloid antigens identified by the monoclonal antibodies (McAb) MCS2 (CD13) and MY9 (CD33) was investigated in 136 cases of leukaemia. MCS2 was positive in blast cells of 78 of 88 (88.5%) and MY9 in 51 of 81 (64%) cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia in myeloid blast crisis. One or other McAb, or both, were positive in all but 2 (2.3%) of these cases. MCS2 was more sensitive than MY9 to detect blasts of the myeloid lineage due to its most frequent reactivity in the cytoplasm of fixed cells by the immunoperoxidase (IP) technique compared with its membrane expression on cell suspensions by immunofluorescence (IF). MY9 was not suitable for tests on fixed cells. MCS2 was positive by IP but not by IF in 24% of AML, but the reverse was not observed. This suggests that the antigen detected by MCS2 is expressed in myeloblasts first in the cytoplasm and later on the cell membrane, pattern which is similar to that of the early antigens CD3 and CD22 in T and B lineage lymphoblasts, respectively. MCS2 was always positive in FAB types of AML-involving myeloblasts (M1-M4), including cases of undifferentiated morphology (M0), whilst MY9 was more frequently positive in monocytic leukaemia (M5). On the other hand, MCS2 was positive in 4 of 33 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and MY9 in 1. We conclude that both McAb, particularly MCS2, contribute to the better characterisation of myeloid leukaemias but that other tests are required to clarify the nature of the blasts when unexpected reactivities are observed.\n",
      "Hairy-cell leukaemia may be difficult to diagnose in bone marrow biopsies, especially in the early stages or in its residum after complete clinical remission. To consider the impact of published data on immunophenotyping hairy-cell leukaemias, a total of 50 diagnostic biopsies were systematically analysed with a panel of eight antibodies and compared with cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL), 20 follicular centre lymphomas, 20 lympho-plasmacytoid immunocytomas, 10 small-cell T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 20 cases of benign nodular lymphatic hyperplasia. The panel of eight antibodies comprised DBA44, CD45, CD20, CD45R, CD45RO, CD43 and the CD68 antibodies KP1 and Ki-M1P. The hairy-cell leukaemias were staged histologically into four categories of bone marrow infiltration. DBA44 reacted positively in 47/50 cases. CD45 and the B-cell markers CD20 and CD45R reacted in 49/50 and 43/50 cases, respectively. One CD68 marker, KP1, was positive in 38/50 cases but the other-Ki-M1P-only in 1/50 cases. Chronic lymphatic leukaemia cases, the other B-cell NHLs and lymphatic hyperplasias showed strong positivity for CD20 and CD45R, but only the immunocytomas reacted with DBA44 in 7/20 cases. The T-cell NHLs and hyperplasias showed a strong positivity for the T-cell markers CD45RO and CD43. The CD68-marker Ki-M1P revealed a high specificity since it was negative in all NHLs and positive only in one hairy-cell leukaemia. Methyl-methacrylate embedding of bone marrow biopsies under cold polymerization produces a high quality of histo- and cytomorphology, resulting in greater diagnostic reliability and the detection of low-stage infiltration of hairy-cell leukaemia. DBA44 appears as a highly specific antibody to mark hairy-cells since only immunocytomas reacted positively in a few cases. A small panel of antibodies including DBA44. CD20, CD45R and Ki-M1P may serve to distinguish small-cell. NHL from hairy-cell leukaemia even at an early stage or when there are minimal residual tumour cells.\n",
      "The objective of this paper is to report a method for estimating the cost of treating acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML). It is based on individual data from 54 patients treated with aggressive induction courses of chemotherapy. The study records the cost of the entire survival period for 40 patients and of at least 16 months' survival for the remaining 14 patients. All treatment activities were registered from the patient records and the price of each activity was estimated. As far as possible the principle of opportunity cost was used. The median survival time was 50 weeks and the average cost per patient was c. 300,000 SEK (= c. USD 50,000) in 1988 prices. A young man who achieved three remissions and lived for five years had the highest cost, c. 1 million SEK (= USD 155,000). The costs for AML treatment was higher in the 1980s than in the 1970s but led to longer survival for patients who survived the initial period.\n",
      "Leukemias are the commonest childhood malignancy in West Bengal. This study was undertaken on 75 children at NRS Medical College, West Bengal to determine the distribution of signs and symptoms of leukemia and to identify unusual clinical features. After obtaining clinical history, physical examination, hematological and radiological investigations were performed. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, 72%) was the commonest followed by acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, 18.7%). Common symptoms and signs were fever (85.3%), pallor (64%), hepatomegaly (72%), splenomegaly (60%) and lymphadenopathy (50.7%). The uncommon signs and symptoms were abdominal pain (9.3%), joint pain (9.3%), hematemesis and malena (8%), diarrhea (5.3%), proptosis (2 cases), dysphagia, mediastinal mass and parotid swelling (1 case each). Uncommon clinical presentations lead to delay in diagnosis in some cases. Awareness of uncommon signs and symptoms of childhood leukemia together with laboratory tests may help in earlier diagnosis and proper management of the patients.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: We have analysed incidence and survival trends of children and adolescents with leukaemia registered in Spanish population-based cancer registries during the period 1983-2007. METHODS: Childhood and adolescent leukaemia cases were drawn from the 11 Spanish population-based cancer registries. For survival, registries with data for the period 1991-2005 and follow-up until 31-12-2010 were included. Overall incidence trends were evaluated using joinpoint analysis. Observed survival rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier, and trends were tested using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Based on 2606 cases (2274 children and 332 adolescents), the overall age-adjusted incidence rate (ASRw) of leukaemia was 47.9 cases per million child-years in children and 23.8 in adolescents. The ASRw of leukaemia increased with an annual percentage change of 9.6 % (95 % CI: 2.2-17.6) until 1990 followed by a stabilisation of rates. In adolescents, incidence did not increase. Five-year survival increased from 66 % in 1991-1995 to 76 % in 2001-2005. By age, survival was dramatically lower in infants (0) and adolescents (15-19) than in the other age groups and no improvement was observed. In both children and adolescents, differences in 5-year survival rates among major subgroups of leukaemias were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing incidence trends observed in childhood leukaemias during the study period were confined to the beginning of the period. Remarkable improvements in survival have been observed in Spanish children with leukaemias. However, this improvement was not observed in infants and adolescents.\n",
      "The graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect is a central component of the stem cell allograft ability to cure haematological malignancies. The GVL effect is mediated by donor-derived natural killer cells and T lymphocytes, which have distinct mechanisms of recognizing and targeting the recipient malignant cells. After transplantation the cytokine milieu is favourable to the early establishment of a GVL effect, but the need to prevent graft-versus-host disease limits the full potential of this process. Clinical studies have identified some critical components of the transplant preparation, donor selection, stem cell source (peripheral blood versus bone marrow) and post-transplant management that can be manipulated to optimize the GVL effect. However, further developments focusing on the selective depletion of unwanted alloreactivity with preservation of GVL effects, and the use of vaccines or the adoptive transfer of leukaemia-specific lymphocytes, will be required to enhance the GVL effect to reliably eradicate more resistant leukaemias.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Ponatinib is effective in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukaemias, but scant data are available regarding the use of this tyrosine kinase inhibitor in children. AIMS: The aim of this study isto describe the tolerance and efficacy of compassionate use of ponatinib in a paediatric cohort of patients with Ph+ leukaemias. METHODS: Data from 11 children with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) registered to the international registry of childhood chronic myeloid leukaemia and from 3 children with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) treated with ponatinib were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: In 11 girls and 3 boys (median age 14 years), ponatinib was used as a second- to eighth-line treatment. Ponatinib was administered as single therapy (9 patients) or in combination with chemotherapy (8 patients). The status of the disease when ponatinib was started was as follows: CML in advanced phases (n = 8), CML in chronic phase without achievement of molecular response (n = 2) or presence of T315I mutation (n = 1) and Ph + ALL in molecular (n = 1) or marrow (n = 2) relapses. The median dose administered was 21.4 mg/m2 and median duration of ponatinib was 2.5 months. Ponatinib alone or in combination with chemotherapy administered on 16 occasions led to achievement of major molecular response in 50% of cases. Ponatinib was used as a bridge to transplant in 4 cases. Among the 9 patients treated with ponatinib alone, toxicity grade III-IV (2 patients) was exclusively haematologic. No vascular events related to ponatinib were observed. CONCLUSION: Ponatinib may be a reasonable additional treatment option for children with Ph+ leukaemias who have failed several lines of therapy.\n",
      "AIM: We aimed to describe and contrast the epidemiology of haematological malignancies among 0-14 and 15-24-year-olds in northern England from 1990 to 2002 and compare clinical trial entry by age group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Incidence rates were examined by age, sex and period of diagnosis and differences were tested using Poisson regression. Differences and trends in survival were assessed using Cox regression. RESULTS: 1680 subjects were included comprising 948 leukaemias and 732 lymphomas. Incidence rates for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were significantly higher for 0-14 compared to 15-24-year-olds, whilst Hodgkin lymphoma showed the reverse. No significant changes in incidence were observed. 60% of leukaemia patients aged 15-24 years entered trials compared to 92% of 0-14-year-olds. Survival rates were significantly lower and improved less markedly over time for 15-24 compared to 0-14-year-olds, particularly for leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Trial accrual rates need to be improved amongst 15-24-year-olds and a more structured follow-up approach adopted for this unique population.\n",
      "The past 20 years of curative therapeutics of childhood acute leukaemia has been largely a period of consolidation of gains, refinement of techniques and dissemination of expertise and technology. However, certain lessons have been learned. First, cure can be permanent but the complexity and cost of curative treatment currently restricts its accessibility; prevention or simple curative treatment is needed. Secondly, cure of the child demands that the risk of adverse sequelae of treatments be carefully balanced with known therapeutic benefits. Thirdly, preventive meningeal irradiation is no longer required. Fourth, treatment intensification is self-limiting. Adverse reactions can cancel out or exceed therapeutic benefits, resulting in a lower cure rate or a similar cure rate with lower quality of cure. Finally, morphology, immunophenotype and genotype of acute leukaemia are important criteria for selecting and scheduling drug therapy. Genotype may be the most important since leukaemia is a genetic disorder for which morphology and immunophenotype are mere reflections. However, none of these features, individually or together, are sufficient to explain all the difference in outcome among children on a given treatment plan or to completely fulfill the need of criteria for selection of treatment. Acute leukaemia remains an unsolved problem demanding considerably more basic and clinical research to meet the need for prevention and simple dependable curative treatment.\n",
      "Elucidation of the molecular genetic basis of leukaemias has relied on the cloning and characterization of recurring chromosomal translocations. A common theme in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) associated with balanced reciprocal translocations is the involvement of transcription factors as one or both of the fusion partners. Transcription factors commonly involved in chromosomal translocations include core binding factor (CBF), retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), ETS family of transcription factors and homeobox gene (HOX) family members. In addition, the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors by these transcription factors suggests that these proteins also may play a critical role in leukaemogenesis. In support of this hypothesis' at least three fusions associated with leukaemias and involving transcriptional co-activators CBP and p300 have been recently cloned. However expression of transcription factor fusion proteins is not sufficient to induce a leukaemic phenotype, as evidenced in part by the long latencies required for disease development in the murine models of the disease. An emerging paradigm is the co-operation between constitutively activated tyrosine kinase molecules, such as FLT3, and transcription factor fusions in the pathogenesis of AML. In such a model, the activated tyrosine kinase confers proliferation and/or anti-apoptotic activity to the hematopoietic cells, while the transcription factor fusion impairs normal differentiation pathways with limited effect on cellular proliferation.\n",
      "We describe a form of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), designated AML-MO, with minimal myeloid differentiation, not included previously in the FAB classification. AML-MO cannot be diagnosed on morphological grounds alone as the blast cells are large and agranular, sometimes resembling L2 or, rarely, L1 lymphoblasts, and should be identified by the following features: negative myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Sudan Black B reaction (or positive in less than 3% of blasts), negative B and T lineage markers and expression of myeloid antigens recognized by at least one monoclonal antibody, CD13 or CD33. Other myeloid markers are also often positive and these include CD11b and the enzyme MPO demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and/or electron microscopy analysis. The findings in a group of 10 cases satisfying the criteria for AML-MO are described. AML-MO represents 2-3% of all cases of AML and 1-1.5% of all acute leukaemias. Its clinical and biological significance is not yet apparent but its identification in a larger number of cases may achieve this aim.\n",
      "Thirty-six cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were tested with a large battery of monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) detecting surface markers normally expressed by myelomonocytic, T and B lymphoid, megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages. Differences in antigenic expression were observed among the various FAB subgroups: HLA-class II molecules were found in almost all AML cases but not in the promyelocytic subgroup (M3); CD14 and CD36 antigens were detected in monocytic leukaemias (M4 and M5); the CD34 moAb (MY10) recognizing an epitope described on myeloid stem cells was positive in 88% of the M1 and 80% of the M3 cases. By a multivariate analysis, only the CD14b (MY4) discriminated significantly between M1-M2 and M4-M5 subgroups. Using Cox model to assess the prognostic importance of variables including immunophenotyping on survival, we undertook a one by one analysis and found that the presence of CD17 antigen predicted for a shorter survival (P = 0.03). In addition this marker appeared more significant than other clinical and biological parameters.\n",
      "An unusual case of CD4+ helper T-cell lymphocytic leukaemia is reported in a 67-year-old Japanese woman. CD4+ cells showed convoluted nuclei and dense cytoplasmic granules, features usually present in CD8+ large granular lymphocytes and disorders of this particular cell type. Serum did not show antibodies to HTLV-I and HTLV-I proviral DNA integration was not evident by Southern blot analysis or after PCR. A monoclonal rearrangement of the TCR-beta chain gene was evident when hybridization methods were used. The patient died 11 months after diagnosis. No skin involvement, or splenomegaly was evident. Serum LDH levels were markedly elevated but serum calcium levels were within normal limits. The case is discussed and compared to other T-cell lymphoid leukaemias. The heterogeneity in the morphology of CD4+ T cell leukaemias is stressed.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) are aggressive haematopoietic neoplasms that, if untreated, can lead to death within days. Up to 40% of presenting patients show evidence of extramedullary involvement (EMI) at diagnosis. EMI is reportedly most prevalent in myelo-monoblastic and monoblastic subtypes of AML (M4 and M5 according to FAB classification) and can present as leukaemic infiltrates in many sites including gingival enlargement and mucosal and skin nodules. We report a case of a patient who presented with gingival enlargement secondary to leukaemic infiltration. This case shows the importance of awareness of leukaemic infiltration as a cause for gingival enlargement.\n",
      "Children with constitutional trisomy 21 (cT21, Down Syndrome, DS) are at a higher risk for both myeloid and B-lymphoid leukaemias. The myeloid leukaemias are often preceded by a transient neonatal pre-leukaemic syndrome, Transient Abnormal Myelopoiesis (TAM). TAM is caused by cooperation between cT21 and acquired somatic N-terminal truncating mutations in the key haematopoietic transcription factor GATA1. These mutations, which are not leukaemogenic in the absence of cT21, are found in almost one-third of neonates with DS. Analysis of primary human fetal liver haematopoietic cells and of human embryonic stem cells demonstrates that cT21 itself substantially alters human fetal haematopoietic development. Consequently, many haematopoietic developmental defects are observed in neonates with DS even in the absence of TAM. Although studies in mouse models have suggested a pathogenic role of deregulated expression of several chromosome 21-encoded genes, their role in human leukaemogenesis remains unclear. As cT21 exists in all embryonic cells, the molecular basis of cT21-associated leukaemias probably reflects a complex interaction between deregulated gene expression in haematopoietic cells and the fetal haematopoietic microenvironment in DS.\n",
      "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess spatial clustering of childhood leukaemias and lymphomas in New Zealand, using a national dataset from a country with no nuclear installations. DESIGN: New Zealand Map Grid coordinates, derived from the birth addresses of cases and controls were used in clustering analyses that applied Cuzick and Edwards' method. SETTING: The whole of New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: The cases were ascertained from the New Zealand Cancer Registry. They were diagnosed with leukaemia or lymphoma at ages 0-14 years during the period 1976 to 1987. For Hodgkin disease, the age range was extended to include those aged from 0-24 years. The cancer registrations were linked with national birth records, to obtain the birth addresses of the cases. The controls were selected at random from birth records, with matching to cases (1:1) on age and sex. The analyses included 600 cases and 600 controls. MAIN RESULTS: There was no statistically significant spatial clustering for any tumour group overall, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia, other leukaemias, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Hodgkin disease, and all these combined. Significant clustering was found in a sub-analysis for one of three age specific subgroups of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ages 10-14 years, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The subgroup finding may have been real or a chance association, as several comparisons were made. This study found little evidence for spatial clustering of leukaemias or lymphomas in a population with no nuclear installations.\n",
      "Eighty-two consecutive cases of acute leukaemias in adult Ethiopians were admitted to the Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion) Hospital, a teaching and referral hospital in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, from January 1982 to December 1992. These cases were studied to describe the clinical and haematological findings, response to therapy and prognosis. The age range was 13-78 (mean 29.6) years. The male to female ratio was 1.6:1. Acute myeloblastic (AML) and acute lymphoblastic (ALL) leukaemias occurred in 53.7% and 46.3%, respectively. The commonest symptoms were anaemia, fever and bleeding tendencies. The commonest signs were pallor, fever, sternal tenderness and purpura. Splenomegaly was more commonly seen in ALL patients. The haematological findings were anaemia (mean Hgb 6.35 g%), leucocytosis (mean WBC count 88,507/mm3) and thrombocytopenia (mean platelet count 31,700/mm3). Of the patients eligible for evaluation treated with chemotherapeutic agents, only 38.4% of ALL and 6.2% of AML achieved complete remission. Twenty-seven patients with ALL died from one day to 84 (median 1.0) months after diagnosis. Ten are lost to follow-up from two weeks to 36 (median 2.5) months, one is still alive 40 months after diagnosis. Thirty-nine of the AML patients died from one day to nine (median 0.3) months after diagnosis. Five are lost to follow-up from two weeks to two and a half (median 2.0) months. The causes of death were sepsis and bleeding, separately or in combination. Increasing numbers of acute leukaemia patients are being referred to this centre. Therefore, attempts should be made to equip it for the treatment of such cases.\n",
      "Monoblasts from 7 patients with acute monoblastic leukaemia produced significantly less procoagulant activity (PCA) in response to endotoxin (mean 0.7 U/10(6) monocytes, range 0.4-1.4) than monocytes from 6 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (mean 6.0 U/10(6) monocytes, range 1.25-10.7) and 15 normal subjects (mean 8.9 U/10(6) monocytes, range 3.1-21.2). However, when expressed as the quantity of monocyte-related PCA generated per millilitre of blood, there was no significant difference between patients with acute monoblastic or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemias, though both types of patients generated significantly higher amounts of PCA than normal subjects or patients in haematological remission. The relationship of these findings to the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation is discussed.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is present in azurophilic granules which appear in the promyelocyte stage of differentiation and is expressed in granulomonocytic cells. MPO is usually detected by cytochemistry. The demonstration of peroxidase in at least 3% of bone marrow blasts defines an acute leukaemia as acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). MPO is important in distinguishing acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). It is difficult to diagnose AML with minimal evidence of myeloid differentiation (AML- M0) by conventional light microscopy. However, these AML-M0 blasts can be detected by monoclonal antibodies. Anti-MPO recognizes the enzymatically inactive precursor forms of MPO. There are a few commercially available monoclonal antibodies against MPO. In this study, we evaluated two monoclonal antibodies against MPO from different commercial sources. METHODS: Anti-MPO were purchased from Dako (Denmark) and Becton Dickinson, BD (California, USA). MPO detection was done using the permeabilisation-staining technique, followed by analysis with flow cytometer (FASCalibur, California, USA). RESULTS: 63 cases of acute leukaemias (38 ALL and 25 AML) were studied. Anti-MPO by Dako showed that 12/38 (31.6%) of ALL cases were positive, but all these cases were clear-cut negative for anti-MPO from BD. 24/38 (63.2%) of these ALL cases were associated with aberrant expression of myeloid antigens. However, only 8/24 (33.3%) cases with aberrant myeloid antigen expression showed positive reaction to anti-MPO (Dako). 23/25 (92%) of AML showed concordance results for both anti-MPO by Dako and BD. CONCLUSION: Anti-MPO is a useful and reliable marker for the diagnosis of AML. However, this study had demonstrated that results vary with the monoclonal antibody used in ALL cases. Anti-MPO (Dako) had shown false positive result in 31.6% of ALL cases whereas anti-MPO (BD) had shown consistent negative result in ALL cases.\n",
      "Leukaemia is the most common cancer in children. The presenting manifestations can be wide-ranging, from a relatively well child to life-threatening complications. Symptoms can be manifested in any of the bodily systems. Undertaking a thorough clinical assessment of the child, in addition to recognising and addressing parental concerns, is vital. Furthermore, recognising that children can commonly present with musculoskeletal or abdominal symptoms increases the diagnostic yield, thereby preventing missed or late diagnoses. Childhood cancer has a huge impact on the child and their family, both at diagnosis and in the long term; providing advice and signposting families to appropriate support groups is an important aspect of their management. Nurses play a vital role in managing children with cancers, starting from raising suspicion and identifying the child with leukaemia, ensuring that high-quality care is delivered throughout their treatment, managing complications, and providing support and information to children and their families. An illustrative case study is included to highlight some of the challenges that health professionals may encounter in their clinical practice.\n",
      "The associations between retinal findings and haematological parameters in acute leukaemia are controversial. Sixty-three newly-diagnosed acute leukaemia patients, aged 12-77 years, were studied prospectively for the presence of intra-retinal haemorrhages (IRH), white-centred haemorrhages (WCH), cotton wool spots (CWS) and macular haemorrhages (MH), Thirty-three patients (52.4%) showed at least one retinal abnormality. The prevalence of individual findings was: IRH (30 cases), WCH (20 cases), CWS (5 cases), MH (11 cases). In contrast to previous studies, there was no association between any of these retinal findings and the haemoglobin level or the platelet count. There was a higher median WBC in patients with IRH (68 x 10(9)/l) than in those without IRH (15.4 x 10(9)/l), P = 0.037. When the acute myeloblastic leukaemia cases were considered separately, an association was also found between higher WBC and the presence of WCH and CWS. There was no association between retinal findings and FAB type in the AML cases. We conclude that a high WBC may be at least as important as anaemia and thrombocytopenia in the pathogenesis of the retinopathy of acute leukaemia.\n",
      "To define more precisely the immunophenotype of lymphoid blast cells, a new flow cytometric technique for the simultaneous detection of surface antigens and nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was established. After staining for the cell surface marker, mononuclear cells were treated with paraformaldehyde (1%) and methanol to permeabilize the cell membrane. Then the cells were stained by indirect immunofluorescence using a rabbit anti-human TdT antibody. Dilution experiments were performed to reveal the sensitivity of the described flow cytometric assay: 0.02% leukaemic cells could reliably be detected above background level among normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is concluded that the double-staining procedure described here is a sensitive tool that contributes to the detection of minimal residual disease in a substantial proportion of acute leukaemias.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Presenting features, biology and outcome for childhood leukaemia are known to vary by ethnic origin, geographic location and socioeconomic group. This study aimed to compare presentation patterns, follow-up and clinical outcomes in Indigenous and non-Indigenous children with acute leukaemia in Australia, and to assess the impact of remoteness and area-based socioeconomic disadvantage on outcome. METHODS: A retrospective review of children aged between 1 day and 18 years who were diagnosed with acute leukaemia in South Australia (SA), Northern Territory (NT) and Western Australia (WA) between 2009 and 2018 was performed. Data were collected from children treated at the Women and Children Hospital, Adelaide and Perth Children Hospital. RESULTS: Analysis of 455 children treated for acute leukaemia showed that children from remote/very remote localities had inferior overall survival (p = .004). Five-year overall survival was 91.7% (95% CI: 87.9-94.3%) for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 69.8% (56.7-79.5%) for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). A larger proportion of Indigenous children from SA/NT were diagnosed with AML compared to non-Indigenous children (60.0% vs. 14.4%, p = .001). Indigenous children were less likely to be enrolled on clinical trials (34.5% vs. 53.1%, p = .03) and more likely to be lost to follow-up (26.1% vs. 9.2%, p = .009). CONCLUSION: Geographic remoteness of residence is associated with inferior overall survival for Australian children with leukaemia. Indigenous children with acute leukaemia suffer from disparities in outcomes. These findings provide evidence to guide national policy in supporting appropriate resource allocation to overcome the challenges faced by children within these groups.\n",
      "Seven cases of swine myeloid leukaemias were investigated by light and electron microscopy. All animals were adult sows. Morphologically these cases were classified as myeloblastic leukaemia with maturation (Cases 1 to 6) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (Case 7). The neoplastic cells were composed of immature promyelocytoid cells in Case 1. In Cases 2, 3, 4 and 5 there were immature or mature promyelocytoid cells containing peroxidase-positive granules. In Case 6, the neoplastic cells consisted of promyelocytoid cells and myelocytoid cells. The latter predominated and contained not only peroxidase-positive granules but also peroxidase-negative ones. The neoplastic cells in Case 7 showed various stages of cell maturation. The morphological characteristics in our cases resembled those in human myeloid leukaemias.\n",
      "A dose related risk of acute leukaemia, myelodysplasia and other cancers is seen in patients treated with certain drugs, particularly alkylating agents, and radiotherapy either alone or in combination. Treatment associated acute myeloid leukaemia (tAML) and myelodysplasia have biological and clinical features in common and are distinct from the corresponding de-novo disorders. tAML generally occurs between 2-11 years from administration of chemo/radiotherapy with few cases thereafter. Patients may present with myelodysplasia and severe cytopenia with abnormalities in all cell lines or as an acute leukaemia which may be difficult to classify because of multi-lineage involvement. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities usually including either loss or interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosomes 5 or 7 are frequently identified. Critical regions deleted in all patients with these lesions have been localised at 5q23-32 and 7q22-31; regions carrying the genes for several haemopoietic growth factors, receptors and oncogenes. The prognosis of patients with tAML is poor with low remission rates and a median survival of 6 months. Complex karyotypes or lesions of chromosomes 5 or 7 seen in the majority of cases are associated with a particularly poor outlook. The risks of this most serious complication of therapy should be weighed carefully against possible benefits.\n",
      "TCR delta gene recombination patterns were analysed by Southern blot, polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing in acute myeloid leukaemias, with coexpression of lymphoid antigens (Ly+ AML, n=10) as well as in early T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias with (My+ T-ALL, n=10) and without coexpression of myeloid antigens (My(-) T-ALL, n=9). These 29 acute leukaemias exhibiting TCR delta gene rearrangements were selected from 66 Ly+ AML, 14 My+ T-ALL and 12 My(-) T-ALL cases. Similar recombination patterns, namely D delta 2J delta1 and V delta 1J delta1 gene rearrangements, were observed in Ly+ AML and My+T-ALL. In contrast to V delta2 D delta3 rearrangements in B-cell precursor ALL, these rearrangements require activation of a T-cell-specific TCR delta enhancer. Comparison of My+ T-ALL and Ly+ AML with My(-) T-ALL exhibited a higher incidence of incomplete D delta 2J delta1 rearrangements in My+ T-ALL and Ly+ AML. Since a D delta 2J delta1 rearrangement is an early event in TCR delta recombination, these leukaemias seem to be arrested at an earlier stage of differentiation. Similar patterns of TCR delta rearrangements in My+ T-ALL and Ly+ AML suggest existence of a common myeloid/T-lymphoid progenitor cell. Although weak or missing expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (T delta T) was found in 7/10 Ly+ AML cases, no difference was observed in numbers of N-nucleotides inserted in junctional regions when comparing with 3/10 cases exhibiting TdT expression. Since TdT activity is necessary for N-nucleotide addition, this finding suggests down-regulation of T delta T expression after rearrangement took place in these Ly+ AML cases.\n",
      "We performed an epidemiological study on 1,471 ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with repeated intravenous injections of the short lived alpha-emitter (224)Ra (excluding radiation therapy with X-rays) between 1948 and 1975. These patients have been followed together with a control group of 1,324 ankylosing spondylitis patients treated neither with radioactive drugs nor with X-rays. The mean follow-up time was 26.3 years in the exposed and 24.6 years in the control group. To date, causes of death have been ascertained for 1,006 exposed patients and 1,072 controls. Special emphasis was placed on the reporting of malignant diseases. Expected numbers of cases were computed for the age, sex and calendar year distribution of both groups using cancer registry incidence rates. In the exposed group 18 cases of kidney cancer (vs. 9.1 cases expected, P < 0.01) and 4 malignant thyroid tumours (vs. 1.2 cases expected, P = 0.03) were observed. In the control group the observed cases for these tumours were not significantly elevated. The most striking observation, however, were the 21 cases of leukaemia in the exposed group (vs. 6.8 cases expected, P < 0.001) compared to 12 cases of leukaemia in the control group (vs. 7.5 cases expected). Further sub-classification of the leukaemias demonstrated a high increase of myeloid leukaemia in the exposed group (12 cases observed vs. 2.9 cases expected, P < 0.001), and out of these, especially a high excess of acute myeloid leukaemias (7 cases observed vs. 1.8 expected, P = 0.003). In the controls the observed cases are within the expected range (4 myeloid leukaemias vs. 3.1 cases). This increase in total leukaemias as well as particularly in myeloid leukaemias is significant in direct comparison between the exposed and control groups too (P < 0.05). The enhanced leukaemia incidence in the exposed group is in line with the observation of increased leukaemia incidence in mice injected with (224)Ra.\n",
      "Immunoglobulin kappa (Igkappa) gene recombinations can be used - similarly to IgH rearrangements - as clonal markers in B-lineage leukaemias. Based on the extensive junctional diversity, these rearrangements represent valuable targets for the analysis of minimal residual disease (MRD). In order to provide a simple method for the rapid detection of leukaemia clone-specific kappa deleting element (Kde) mediated rearrangements, we developed a multiplex PCR reaction that is able to amplify the five most frequent rearrangements in one tube. Position of the amplimers were chosen to enable identification of the involved segments according to the size of the PCR product. This method was tested on 101 B-lineage leukaemias (71 childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (BCP ALL) and 30 chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLL)). 39 and 22 Kde rearrangements could be readily detected in 30 (44%) BCP ALL and 22 (56%) CLL, respectively. 36% of the Kde rearrangements in BCP ALL and 45% in CLL were intron recombination signal sequence (RSS)-Kde rearrangements. The other Kde rearrangements involved the Vkappa families: VkappaI in 36% and 50%, VkappaII in 32% and 16.7%, VkappaIII in 24% and 25%, and VkappaIV in 8% and 8.3% in BCP ALL and CLL, respectively. The sensitivity of the multiplex system was 10-2-10-3. We compared this multiplex PCR assay with multiple single PCR reactions using different sets of primer combinations. Thereby the number and types of rearrangements were confirmed in all cases. Clonality of rearrangements was proven by sequence analysis. Our data show that by this method clonal Kde rearrangements were rapidly detected and precisely identified.\n",
      "Leukaemia is a malignant neoplasm of the haematopoietic system. Cutaneous manifestations of leukaemia are called leukaemia cutis, and are regarded as a sign of poorer prognosis and shorter survival time. A single-institution retrospective review was performed of medical records of patients diagnosed with leukaemia cutis in the dermatology department of Seoul St Mary Hospital between January 2012 and April 2021. Fifty-six cases with cutaneous leukaemic involvement and underlying haematological malignancy were included (40 acute myelogenous leukaemia, 8 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 3 chronic myeloid leukaemia, 2 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and 3 myelodysplastic syndrome). Male-female ratio 1.9:1, mean age at diagnosis 45.8 years. Plaques (28%) and papules (27%) were the most common skin lesions, followed by patches (18%) and nodules (16%). Mean time from diagnosis of leukaemia to development of leukaemia cutis was 12.3 months. Forty-six patients (84%) died during the 7-year follow-up; mean time from diagnosis of leukaemia cutis to death was 5.4 months. The results suggest that leukaemia cutis is associated with poor outcomes in patients with leukaemia. Comprehensive skin examination of these patients may help diagnose leukaemia cutis early, enabling prompt treatment.\n",
      "Previous studies have shown that patients diagnosed with some autoimmune (AI) diseases are at an increased risk of leukaemia but limited data are available on survival. We systematically analysed the risks (standardized incidence ratio, SIR) and survival (hazard ratio, HR) in nine types of leukaemia among 402 462 patients hospitalized for any of 33 AI diseases and compared to persons not hospitalized for AI diseases. Risk for all leukaemia was increased after 13 AI diseases and survival was decreased after six AI diseases. SIRs were increased after all AI diseases for seven types of leukaemia, including SIR 1·69 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1·29-2·19) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 1·85 (95% CI: 1·65-2·07) for acute myeloid leukaemia, 1·68 (95% CI: 1·37-2·04) for chronic myeloid leukaemia, 2·20 (95% CI: 1·69-2·81) for 'other myeloid leukaemia', 2·45 (95% 1·99-2·98) for 'other and unspecified leukaemia', 1·81 (95% CI: 1·11-2·81) for monocytic leukaemia, and 1·36 (95% CI: 1·08-1·69) for myelofibrosis. The HRs were increased for four types of leukaemia, most for myelofibrosis (1·74, 95% CI: 1·33-2·29) and ALL (1·42, 95% CI: 1·03-1·95). Some AI diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, were associated with increased SIRs and HRs in many types of leukaemia. The present data showed increases in risk and decreases in survival for many types of leukaemia after various AI diseases. Leukaemia is a rare complication in AI disease but findings about this comorbidity at the time of leukaemia diagnosis may help to optimize the treatment and improve survival.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease. Prognosis of AML is influenced both by patient-specific as well as disease-specific factors. Age is the most prominent patient-specific risk factor, while chromosomal aberrations are the strongest disease-specific risk factors. For patients with cytogenetically normal AML, prognosis can be specified by mutational status of the genes NPM1, FLT3 and CEBPA. A growing number of recurrent mutations in additional genes have recently been identified, for which the prognostic effect yet has to be determined. Performance status, geriatric assessment, secondary leukaemia following myelodysplastic syndrome or cytotoxic treatment, common laboratory parameters, leukaemic stem cell frequency, bone marrow microenvironment, gene expression levels, epigenetic changes, micro-RNA as well as kinetics and depth of response to treatment influence prognosis of AML patients. Despite the high number of established risk factors, only few predictive markers exist which can truly aid therapy decisions in patients with AML.\n",
      "The purpose of the study was assessment of the effectiveness of treatment applied in nine proliferative diseases of the haemopoietic system (PDHS) in the years 1951-1980. The effectiveness was determined comparing the mean survival time in each of these diseases in three 10-year-time periods characterised by essential changes in their treatment. Moreover, other factors were studied which may influence the survival time in these diseases. A continuing increase in the survival time correlated with advances in therapy was observed in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), Hodgkin disease (HD) and multiple myeloma (MM). An indicator of the advances in the treatment of acute leukaemias was also an over fourfold rise in the likelihood of achieving complete remission in the decade 1971-1980 in relation to two preceding decades. On the other hand, no improvement of the effectiveness of treatment was noted in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), polycythaemia vera (PV), myelofibrosis (MF) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The length of the survival time was influenced also considerably by patient age (survival lower in old age), sex (better results in women) and place of residence of the patient (worse results in patients living in rural areas).\n",
      "Internationally there is a 4-fold variation in age-adjusted incidence rates for childhood leukaemia (all types combined), with only slightly greater worldwide differences specifically for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and for acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). Total leukaemia rates are highest among Hispanic populations in Costa Rica and Los Angeles (males), due primarily to elevated ALL incidence, while low rates occur among US blacks, Kuwaitis, Israeli non-Jews, and Bombay Indians. In most populations the patterns for ALL are similar to those for total leukaema, with peak incidence at ages 1-4 and a decline thereafter. Lower and more uniform rates are generally observed at all ages for ANLL. Age-adjusted rates for ANLL appear to vary substantially among some populations with uniform ALL incidence rates (e.g., among Asians) and yet appear to be similar in other populations with variation in ALL rates (e.g., whites and blacks in the US). Possible variation among registries in completeness of childhood leukaemia ascertainment and accuracy of diagnosis by cell type should be assessed, while case-control investigations among populations with very high and very low rates may provide useful information about the cell-type specific determinants of childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "Haematological malignancies associated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) are often acute myeloid leukaemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) has been reported rarely in these situations. Cytogenetics of CRT-associated CML is not different from de novo CML, and there are not enough data about its prognosis. We report two patients who had CRT because of lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, who subsequently developed CML.\n",
      "The outcome for adults with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) leukaemias (chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)) has been dramatically improved with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but progression and/or relapse are still present in the majority of patients. We reviewed recent findings obtained from analysis of BCR-ABL point mutations, gene expression profiling (GEP) analysis single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and characterised by the identification of multiple novel genetic alterations targeting key cellular pathways, including lymphoid differentiation, cell cycle, tumour suppression, apoptosis and drug responsiveness. By GEP analysis, several down/up-expressed genes have been identified. Furthermore, by SNP array analysis, deletions of genes such as IKAROS, PAX5 and CDKN2A-CDKN2B were frequently identified. New therapeutic approaches with novel TKIs are now available. Dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib are now in clinical development. Some emerging aurora kinase inhibitors, such as VX-680, PHA-739358, MK-0457 and AS703569, and Smo1 and Hedgehog (Hh) inhibitors promise clinical efficacy against the Bcr-Ab T315I mutant form and leukaemia stem cells, respectively. In this review, we highlight the most promising drugs for the treatment of adult BCR-ABL-positive leukaemias.\n",
      "Biphenotypic acute leukaemia (BAL) patients represented 8% of the 287 de novo consecutive adult acute leukaemias (23 BAL, 230 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 34 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)) referred to our department during the last 4-year period. Of these 23 BAL patients, 14 patients showed myeloid morphology and nine cases lymphoid morphology according to FAB criteria. There were no differences between lymphoid and myeloid BAL according to clinical and biological presentation and treatment outcome. We confirm the poor prognosis of BAL when compared to AML or ALL seen during the same period of time, in terms of complete remission (47%, 62% and 82% respectively, BAL v AML, NS and BAL v ALL, P = 0.006) and 4-year overall survival (8.1%, 25.8% and 23.8% respectively, BAL v AML, P = 0.05 and BAL v ALL, P = 0.003). Comparing adult BAL patients with AML patients, we found an increase in poor prognostic factors: CD34+ phenotype (82% v 60% respectively, P = 0.03), unfavourable karyotype (60% v 20%, P < 0.0001) and Pgp over-expression by RT-PCR (0.705 v 0.107, P < 0.0001) and flow cytometry (0.824 v 0.391, P = 0.0001). MRP and LRP were not found to be poor prognostic factors. Comparing BAL patients with ALL patients, we found also an increase in poor prognostic factors: age (51 v 39, P = 0.003) and CD34+ phenotype (82% v 50%, P = 0.02). We conclude that BAL patients need a more aggressive treatment procedure, including high-dose AraC or the use of Pgp modulators for first-line therapy.\n",
      "The expression and function of the Fas-receptor (Fas-R) were examined in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), hairy cell leukaemia-variant (HCL-v) and adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL). The expression of Fas-R in freshly isolated leukaemic cells was qualitatively and quantitatively different between each disease; faint in B-CLL, moderate in HCL-v and strong in ATL. Both full-length and alternatively spliced truncated forms of Fas mRNA were detected even in CLL B cells with faint to negative Fas-R, and Fas mRNA was also shown to be capable of increasing in vitro expression, i.e. the message was functional. In contrast, Fas-R expression on ATL cells was heterogenous and usually intense with a mean density approximately 3-fold higher than that of normal T cells. Fas-R was confirmed to have the potential function for anti-Fas monoclonal antibody-mediated cell death in vitro in Fas-R+ ATL cells. The expression level of Fas-R on the cells was higher in chronic than acute ATL (10,360 v 6260 antibody-binding capacity per cell, mFasABC; P<0.05) and was inversely correlated with serum LDH activity, suggesting that the strong Fas-R accounts for the slow progression of chronic ATL and the negative Fas-R protects from Fas-mediated cell death. These results show that Fas-R expression on leukaemic cells is valuable in their characterization and perhaps their function, and may contribute to the progression and immune evasion of malignant clones.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This was to describe and analyse incidence and survival data on childhood leukaemias. SAMPLE: Incident leukaemia cases aged 0-19 from the cancer registry holdings of the province of Saskatchewan for the 60-year period 1932-1991 are the subject of this descriptive report. METHODS: Age-adjusted, age-specific, histologic-type specific, sex-specific, and cohort-specific incidence trends were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses explored the effects of time period, age at diagnosis, gender, and histologic type. RESULTS: Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) occurred more commonly in males and before the age of five; the 1982-1991 age-adjusted incidence is 3.1/100,000. Increasing incidence has been consistently noted, but has attenuated since 1971. The relative risk of developing ALL in the first 9 years of life, using children born from 1944 to 1948 as baseline, increased with each successive 5-year birth cohort until 1969-1973; since then the risk has been stable. Other histologic types were rare; over 60 years there were only 85 cases that could be grouped as acute non-lymphocytic leukaemias (ANLL); the 1982-1991 age-adjusted ANLL incidence is 0.6/100,000. A dramatic improvement in survival was seen over the last six decades, primarily for ALL. In ALL, children under five have better survival than older children and adolescents; the reverse is true for ANLL. CONCLUSIONS: ALL and ANLL are distinctive diseases clinically and the epidemiological findings are likewise distinctive. Our current ALL patterns are consonant with a number of other published reports. However, our small numbers of ANLL limit inferences.\n",
      "Comprehensive cataloguing of the acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) genome has revealed a high frequency of mutations and deletions in epigenetic factors that are frequently linked to treatment resistance and poor patient outcome. In this review, we discuss how the epigenetic mechanisms that underpin normal haematopoiesis are subverted in AML, and in particular how these processes are altered in childhood and adolescent leukaemias. We also provide a brief summary of the burgeoning field of epigenetic-based therapies, and how AML treatment might be improved through provision of better conceptual frameworks for understanding the pleiotropic molecular effects of epigenetic disruption.\n",
      "Patients with acute leukaemia have normal or near normal numbers of haemopoietic stem cells in their marrow at diagnosis. Remission is achieved when the administration of cytotoxic drugs eradicates the bulk of the leukaemic population while sparing normal haemopoiesis. The mechanism by which chemotherapy seems to act in this selective manner is essentially unknown. Nevertheless, remission rates of 80-95% can be achieved in children and in 50-80% of adults with acute leukaemia. Attempts to cure patients in remission may entail either \"continuing curative chemotherapy\" or \"supralethal\" doses of chemoradiotherapy followed by autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The relative merits of these different methods remain highly controversial but chemotherapy is usually the preferred method of continuing treatment for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in first remission; and allogeneic transplantation is recommended for younger adults with acute myeloid leukaemia who have suitable HLA-identical sibling donors. The role of autografting is still experimental. Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia can achieve long term remission and probably cure following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation but the resultant risks of mortality are still appreciable. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia currently remains incurable.\n",
      "Despite lack of cross-resistance with vincristine and a somewhat different toxicity spectrum, the semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid, vindesine, has not yet achieved its expected potential in the treatment of acute leukaemias. The ability of vindesine to induce remissions in vincristine-resistant and relapsed ALL is of particular interest for the development of potentially curative second-line regimens. Vindesine may also have a role in consolidation strategies for de novo ALL, although it will be difficult to demonstrate specific advantages for this agent as part of a multidrug treatment approach. In myeloid leukaemias, while vindesine appears to have a limited role in ANLL, it may be useful for the palliative treatment of CML blast crisis. In the future, new synergistic combinations, incorporating vindesine with for example, methotrexate or edatrexate, may be developed.\n",
      "Childhood leukaemias and lymphomas have been associated with exposure to environmental factors, including infections, which show geographical variation. This study examined the geographical distribution of the incidence of acute leukaemia and lymphoma using Manchester Children Tumour Registry (MCTR) data 1976-2000. A total of 910 children were included, all of whom had histologically and/or cytologically verified leukaemia or lymphoma. At the time of their diagnoses, all the children were aged 0-14 years and were resident in the counties of Greater Manchester or Lancashire. Standardized morbidity ratios were calculated. Poisson regression was used to examine the relationship between incidence rates and small-area (census ward) population density, ethnic composition and deprivation index. There was a monotonic relationship between acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) incidence and population density (P = 0.05). Higher rates were seen in more densely populated areas. There was evidence for a monotonic relationship between the incidence of the mixed cellularity subtype of Hodgkin disease (HD) and the Townsend deprivation score (P = 0.001). Markedly higher incidence was associated with greater levels of unemployment and household overcrowding. The results for ALL and mixed cellularity HD support the involvement of environmental factors, such as infections, in disease aetiology.\n",
      "Predictions arising out of a mathematical model that describes the expansion of leukaemia from a diffusion-orientated perspective are critiqued and validated by employing available real time data. Based on agreements found between model predictions and the data, but mindful of the limitations it presents, it is concluded that the model could be used to describe the dynamics of normal and abnormal cells in leukaemia. It is suggested that further studies of the behaviour of certain normal cell types in contrast to abnormal cells during leukaemic development could engender additional insights into leukaemia and its treatment.\n",
      "A better understanding of the biology of malignant cells and of the host immune system together with dramatic advances in technology have led to the design of innovative immune-mediated approaches to control neoplastic clones, including various haematological malignancies. One of the major problems with conventional cancer therapies is their inability to eradicate residual cancer cells that are resistant to therapy, hence immune intervention might improve the clinical outcome of patients. This mini-review will focus mainly on immunological approaches to the therapy of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), a subset of a much larger family of leukaemias. Immune-mediated approaches ranging from allogeneic lymphocyte transplants to cytokine therapy, immune-gene therapy and vaccination by dendritic-cell-based vaccines will be discussed.\n",
      "One hundred and eighteen patients with chronic leukaemias were seen at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, between 1964 and 1982. There were 75 patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) and 43 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Although most of them presented with the familiar features of chronic leukaemias, a few features were remarkably different from those reported in some of the Caucasian series. CLL is less common than CGL in contrast to their relative incidence in Caucasians. Our patients generally presented with more massive splenomegaly and more severe anaemia, which could be attributed to late presentation, endemic malaria and possibly increased hypersplenism. The peak-age incidence in our patients with CGL was found in a younger age group (20-40 yr) than in the Caucasian series. When compared with a Caucasian series, our CGL patients on presentation had a significantly higher proportion of immature cells (blasts and promyelocytes) (P less than 0.05), probably reflecting their more delayed presentation. Follow up was generally poor as a result of a high default rate. Survival duration of both leukaemias was generally lower than in Caucasian series and for CGL patients there was a significant negative correlation between survival and spleen size at presentation, while for CLL patients there was a significant association between poor survival duration and high white cell count at presentation.\n",
      "Leukaemias are often characterised by nonrandom chromosomal translocations that, at the molecular level, induce the activation of specific oncogenes or create novel chimeric genes. They have frequently been regarded as optimal targets for gene silencing approaches, as these single abnormalities may directly initiate or maintain the malignant process. Since the ground-breaking discovery that double-stranded RNA molecules 21 - 23 nucleotides in length, named small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are able to elicit gene-specific inhibition also in mammalian cells, the interest of the scientific community has rapidly been drawn to the potential of these siRNAs for targeting oncogenic fusion genes in leukaemic cells. There has been a flurry of reports describing overexpressed or mutated genes that may also serve as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention by RNA silencing methods. Although this approach seems to be relatively straightforward, many problems remain to be solved before siRNAs may become clinically implemented as 'leukaemia drugs'. Difficulties in delivering siRNAs into the leukaemic cell, inefficient target mRNA cleavage, prolonged protein half-life in cancer cells, nonspecific side effects caused by targeting other genes than those originally thought, immunological reactions of the host organism against the siRNAs, such as interferon responses, or even acquired resistance mechanisms, such as escape mutants, should be overcome. This paper reviews the current knowledge regarding the use of siRNAs, either chemically synthesised or intracellular-generated via specialised expression constructs, in order to suppress the falsely activated oncogenes in haematopoietic malignancies.\n",
      "The prognostic significance of immunophenotypical properties of leukaemic cells is well known. However, the biological and clinical significance of CD7 and CD56 antigen expression in acute leukaemias are not clearly established. In patients with acute leukaemias, we identified CD7 and CD56 expression and analysed their associations with markers expressed early in haemopoietic ontogeny and clinical parameters. Among 22 patients with acute leukaemia [12 acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), 10 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)], we found CD7 positivity in 15 of 22 patients (68%) and CD56 positivity in four patients (18%). CD7 positivity was observed in seven patients (58%) with AML and in eight patients (80%) with ALL. CD56 positivity was observed in three patients (25%) with AML and one patient (10%) with ALL. Lymphadenopathy was present in five patients and associated with hepatosplenomegaly in three patients with ALL. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were present in three patients with AML. Central nervous system involvement was seen in one patient with ALL. Complete remission was achieved in nine patients (41%) (five ALL and four AML). Our data showed that CD7 and CD56 positivity at diagnosis associated with low remission rate and biological aggressiveness in a significant proportion of patients. We suggest the evaluation of CD7 and CD56 in all patients with acute leukaemias at the time of diagnosis in view of poor clinical outcome.\n",
      "Light scattering properties and antigen distribution of lymphocytes labeled with the monoclonal antibodies CD 5 and CD 20 were determined for 19 patients with a chronic B-cell derived leukaemia. The density of the antigen detected by the monoclonal antibody CD 5 appeared to be considerably lower on malignant B-lymphocytes of the patients as compared with T lymphocytes. A large variation was observed in the amount of receptors for the monoclonal antibodies CD 5 and CD 20 on the malignant cells of the different patients. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) patients were clearly distinguishable from leukaemic follicular non Hodgkin lymphoma patients (LF-NHL, formerly lymphosarcoma cell leukaemia) and from a patient with a prolymphocytoid transformation (PLT) of the B-CLL according to the amount of the antigens for CD 5 and CD 20. Within the B-CLL patient population, no relation of progression of the disease with distribution of these antigens could be observed. In one patient the extraordinary phenotype CD 20+, CD 11+, leu 8+, CD 5- of the malignant lymphocytes was observed. An experimentally simple method to differentiate between the various chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLL) appeared to be the determination of orthogonal light scattering properties of lymphocytes. In healthy donors one can always distinguish two populations of lymphocytes in the orthogonal light scatter histograms. Lymphocytes of B-CLL patients show one uniform population with a relatively small orthogonal light scattering signal, lymphocytes of our patients with PLT of B-CLL or with LF-NHL show one uniform population with a relatively large orthogonal light scattering signal.\n",
      "The diagnosis of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) is based on cell morphology, cytogenetic and molecular changes, cell markers and clinical data. Our aim was to establish whether morphology and cell markers are comparable in the evaluation of AML. Bone marrow smears were analysed, and flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies were used to determine cell type and maturity. Morphology and cell markers correlated differently in different AML subtypes.\n",
      "Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a frequent complication of acute leukaemia, in particular acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Although procoagulant substances released from leukaemic blast cells may induce DIC by activating conventional coagulation pathways, there is increasing evidence to suggest that direct activation of fibrinogen by proteases released from blast cells may be the predominant mechanism by which DIC is initiated. Primary fibrinolysis has also been proposed as the cause of the haemorrhagic diathesis in some cases of acute leukaemia. Although plasminogen activators have been demonstrated in leukaemic blast cells supporting this view, cases of primary fibrinolysis would appear to be rare. A bleeding tendency attributed to primary fibrinolysis may more often be the result of an exaggerated fibrinolytic response secondary to DIC. The main strategies of treatment for leukaemia associated DIC are rapid initiation of chemotherapy and vigorous blood product support until the DIC resolves once the blast cells have been eradicated. The role of heparin in the management of leukaemia associated DIC remains controversial. There is recent evidence to suggest that heparin therapy does reduce the incidence of haemorrhagic death although it has been recommended that relatively low intravenous doses should be administered initially to reduce the risk of heparin induced haemorrhage.\n",
      "This study examined the ability of the semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid, Vinorelbine/Navelbine, to cause apoptotic death in freshly obtained primary leukaemia cells from 53 patients with haematological malignancies, including 22 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 24 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), three patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) and four patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Vinorelbine caused apoptosis in primary leukaemia cells from 42 (79%) of these leukaemia patients. Objective responses, including complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete haematological recovery, were achieved in 12 of 17 (71%) patients with aggressive and therapy-refractory leukaemias, including five of nine patients with relapsed ALL, three of three patients with CML-BC and four of five patients with rapidly progressive CLL, who were treated with a vinorelbine-based salvage chemotherapy regimen. Drug sensitivity profiling of multidrug-resistant primary cancer cells using apoptosis assays revealed a significant association between Vinorelbine sensitivity in vitro and the likelihood of an objective clinical response to Vinorelbine-based chemotherapy. Vinorelbine-sensitivity testing of primary leukaemia cells might help tailor Vinorelbine-based salvage regimens to those patients who are most likely to respond.\n",
      "Acute leukaemia represents a diverse group of blood cancers that affect both children and adults. Treatment schedules for these haematology cancers are often prolonged, with many associated side effects and complications. Nurses caring for patients with acute leukaemia require an anticipatory approach, where care is aimed at minimizing the side effects of treatment and being constantly vigilant for any impending adverse effects. Moreover, patients require support for the psychosocial issues that can arise for patients during their illness. This article provides an overview of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia. Nursing considerations in the care of patients being treated for acute leukaemia are also explored.\n",
      "We have studied the arrangement of the alpha, beta and gamma T cell receptor (TCR) genes in 27 patients with T cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Nine patients had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), nine patients had prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL), six patients presented with a T-CLL/T-lymphocytosis syndrome, two patients had Sezary syndrome (SS) and one patient had HTLV-I positive T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL). alpha TCR gene rearrangement could be demonstrated by the use of three available probes in only one case. By contrast, both beta and gamma TCR gene rearrangement could be demonstrated by Southern blot analysis of DNA samples digested with appropriate restriction enzymes in the majority of cases. In general, when rearrangements were present they involved both alleles. The proportion of rearranged chromosomes was lower in T-ALL than in other forms of T-cell leukaemia and it was lower in cases with the CD4-/CD8+ phenotype than in those with a CD4+/CD8- phenotype. In three out of 34 cases of B-cell leukaemia the TCR beta-gene but not the TCR gamma-gene was rearranged, just as in two out of 26 cases of T-cell leukaemia the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain but not the light chain genes were rearranged. These data suggest that development of the machinery required for gene rearrangement may precede commitment to B or T cell lineage. The use of this technique is especially useful for the classification of cases of ALL in which the cells are negative with respect to most current phenotypic markers and in cases of T cell lymphocytosis in which the finding of a gene rearrangement identifies a monoclonal cell population.\n",
      "A case-control study has been performed for occupational risk factors of acute leukaemia, based on 185 cases more than 30 years old and 513 matched controls. There was a significant excess of polyvalent farming and electronic engineers among professions of cases, and, in addition of metal workers when considering the professions pursued for more than 5 years. The corresponding exposures were analysed through a detailed questionnaire, and assessed by an industrial hygienist after blinding the case-control status. The odds ratios (OR) were computed after adjustment on matching variables and prior chemo- or radiotherapy treatment, and after stratification for the level and total duration of exposure. There was no excess of professional exposure to ionizing radiation among cases. A significant relationship was observed between acute leukaemia and high or medium exposure to benzene, as well as over 10 years high or medium exposure to exhaust gas. In addition a significant relationship was observed with exposure to pesticides--insecticides and/or weed killers--and to electric and magnetic fields (EMF). The relationship with pesticides was significant when considering high or medium exposure to weed killers and more than 10 years exposure to both subtypes of pesticides. The relationship with pesticides and EMF remained significant when confounding factors were taken into consideration and after adjustment on co-exposure to benzene. The cytological studies showed that acute leukaemias following exposure to benzene (high or medium) and to EMF were only of myelogenous subtypes, whereas those following exposure to pesticides were divided between lymphoblastic and myeloblastic subtypes. Cytogenetic studies failed to show increased frequency of chromosomal abnormalities, as described in acute leukaemias secondary to anti-cancer treatments. Our study adds credence to the hypothesis that pesticides and EMF are leukaemogenic agents, together with benzene.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In 2018, leukaemia accounted for 2.6% of all new cancers, it being the 13th most common cause of cancer and the 10th most common cause of cancer death. Glucocorticoids are commonly used in lymphoid leukaemia treatment, where they are cytotoxic. The aim of this review is to highlight ongoing research of steroid use in myeloid leukaemias. MAIN TEXT: Glucocorticoids increase infection risks in acute myeloid leukaemia, but with adequate antifungal cover, they can help in hyperleucocytic disease. They also show some benefits in sensitising multidrug-resistant AML cell lines to cytotoxic agents, induce differentiation marker expression and can also induce CD38 expression, making AML cells possible targets of daratumumab. Cardiotonic steroids, like digitalis, are being recognised as sensitising AML cells to the chemotherapeutic effects of many cytotoxic agents, primarily by inhibiting efflux pumps, thus minimising AML resistance. Ecdysteroids enhance sensitivity in multidrug-resistant AML, but also in non-resistant AML cell lines, through pathways including the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis. Their anti-apoptotic effects on non-malignant cell lines help their target specificity. Sensitisation is chemotherapy-specific, enhancing the effects of doxorubicin and tubulin inhibitors but increasing resistance to cisplatinum. SHORT CONCLUSION: Cardiotonic steroids and ecdysteroids both show chemosensitisation to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy on AML cell lines. It is likely time to consider clinical trials to assess whether these, as well as traditional glucocorticoids, can contribute to the AML armamentarium, particularly in chemo-resistant disease.\n",
      "While deletion or mutation of the p53 gene is one of the most common molecular alterations detected in a wide variety of tumours, it has been shown to occur in only a relatively small percentage of the leukaemia cases examined. However, it may be that other components of the p53 pathway are involved. Amplification of the MDM2 gene has recently been demonstrated in human sarcomas resulting in an increase in MDM2 protein levels. This protein can bind to p53 preventing the transactivation of p53 responsive genes, thus mimicking mutation or deletion of p53. We have investigated the prevalence of MDM2 amplification in human leukaemias. 101 leukaemia or lymphoma samples and nine cell lines were studied using Southern blotting. In no case was MDM2 amplification present. We conclude that MDM2 amplification is not a common event in human leukaemias.\n",
      "Inactivation of the retinoblastoma growth suppressor gene (RB) is responsible for the development of retinoblastomas and occurs frequently in osteosarcomas and small cell lung carcinoma. Knowledge about the involvement of RB in the pathogenesis of myeloid leukaemias is still scarce. In this study we looked at the expression of the retinoblastoma gene product (p105) in 20 primary myelomonocytic and monoblastic leukaemias by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry using the anti-p105-monoclonal antibody PMG3-245. We found absence of or barely detectable levels of p105 in 11 patients (55%). Absence of or low levels of p105 were correlated with a higher leucocyte count at presentation (133 x 10(9)/l v 83 x 10(9)/l) and with the occurrence of extramedullary leukaemia (8/10 v 2/10). We conclude that abnormal expression of RB with absence of p105 or strongly reduced p105 levels occurs frequently in myelomonocytic and monoblastic leukaemias and that this may be correlated with a more malignant course of the disease.\n",
      "AIMS: To investigate whether leukaemia risks are related to occupational exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields. METHODS: Leukaemia risks experienced by 73 051 employees of the former Central Electricity Generating Board of England and Wales were investigated for the period 1973-2010. All employees were hired in the period 1952-82 and were employed for at least 6 months with some employment in the period 1973-82. Detailed calculations had been performed by others to enable an assessment to be made of exposures to magnetic fields. Poisson regression was used to calculate relative risks (rate ratios) of developing leukaemia or leukaemia subtypes for categories of lifetime, distant (lagged) and recent (lugged) exposure. RESULTS: Findings for all leukaemias combined were unexceptional; risks were close to unity for all exposure categories and there was no suggestion of risks increasing with cumulative (or recent or distant) magnetic field exposures. There were no statistically significant dose-response effects shown for acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. There was a significant positive trend for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), but this was based, in the main, on unusually low risks in the lowest exposure category. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no convincing evidence to support the hypothesis that exposure to magnetic fields is a risk factor for leukaemia, and the findings are consistent with the hypotheses that both distant and recent magnetic field exposures are not causally related to the generality of leukaemia. The limited positive findings for ALL may well be chance findings.\n",
      "Selected dietary risk factors and other environmental factors were studied in 119 adult patients (60 males and 59 females of the Cracow region) with acute leukaemia (91 acute myeloid leukaemia and 28 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia), by a case-control study method and logistic regression modelling of the risk of leukaemia. It was shown that the diet of patients with acute leukaemias before the onset of the disease differed qualitatively and quantitatively from that of healthy subjects of control groups. The risk of acute leukaemia was elevated in the subjects characterized by rare consumption of raw vegetables, frequent drinking of milk, frequent consumption of poultry, and drinking of soft water. Other environmental conditions connected with the dietary risk were: frequent viral infections, vaccination with the vaccinia virus, frequent use of aminophenazone, presence of fungi in the house, drinking of milk supplied from own own cows, and frequent deaths of reared poultry.\n",
      "Our understanding of cancer biology has been radically transformed over recent years with a more realistic grasp of its multilayered cellular and genetic complexity. These advances are being translated into more selective and effective treatment of cancers and, although there are still considerable challenges, particularly with drug resistance and metastatic disease, many patients with otherwise lethal malignancies now enjoy protracted remissions or cure. One largely unheralded theme of this story is the extent to which new biological insights and novel clinical applications have their origins with leukaemia and related blood cell cancers, including lymphoma. In this Timeline article, I review the remarkable and ground-breaking role that studies in leukaemia have had at the forefront of this progress.\n",
      "In the present work the incidence and survival of acute de novo leukaemias in two neighbouring countries, were studied retrospectively over three 5-year periods, 1982-1996. The aim was to compare the above variables, particularly with respect to political/socio-economic and environmental factors, in a well defined area of Sweden, the so-called Western Swedish Health Care Region, with Estonia. Population-wise the Western Swedish Region and Estonia are very similar; area-wise they are also well comparable. The present report covers only patients diagnosed between the ages of 16-64 years. The number of acute de novo leukaemias in the two regions was quite similar (Western Sweden n = 282 and Estonia n = 237). The age standardized incidence rate regarding total acute de novo leukaemias was slightly lower in Estonia than in Western Sweden (1.49/100,000 inhabitants/year for Estonia and 1.76 for Sweden, respectively), the difference being not statistically significant. However, the survival data for the two countries were highly different (P < 0.001). Thus, the relative survival for the total group of patients aged 16-64 years in Estonia at 1 year was 20.7% and at 5 years 3.6%, respectively. The corresponding figures for the Swedish patients were considerably higher, 65.2 and 29.4%, respectively. Further, the 5 year survival significantly (P < 0.05) increased for the Swedish patients over the 3 consecutive 5-year periods. No such improvement was recorded for the Estonian patients.\n",
      "This study was designed to investigate leukaemia mortality in the population under the age of 25 residing around the 13 French nuclear sites operating in 1985. In four geographical zones defined according to the distance from the site, 503 exposed communes were identified and followed up between 1968 and 1989. A total of 4,132,000 person-years of observation were accumulated. The number of leukaemia deaths observed (69) did not differ from the expected number (86.15) estimated according to national mortality statistics. There was no difference in the risks of leukaemia mortality according to sex, age, type of installation and no trend with an increasing distance from installations.\n",
      "Nonspecific cutaneous xanthomas have been reported in a variety of lymphocytic neoplastic processes, but to date only three cases of xanthomatous lesions associated with monocytic leukaemias have been described. We now report a patient with a chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) associated with these lesions. The clinical and immunohistochemical features do not correspond to any entity previously described and suggest that xanthomas is are a cutaneous expression of the CMML.\n"

      "Haemorrhagic diathesis is the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality in acute leukaemias (AL). It is most commonly due to thrombocytopenia resulting from bone marrow failure. However, in a significant number of cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) plays an important part. Previously it was thought that this mechanism was mainly confined to acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), but recently it has also been reported to occur in other subtypes of acute leukaemia. We report the results of a study carried out to find the incidence of DIC in various types of AL at the time of first diagnosis and in the absence of other recognisable causes. DIC was observed in 14(13.4%) cases out of 104 cases of AL studied. Nine out of 49(18.4%) cases of AML and 5 out of 55(9.1%) cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) showed coagulation abnormalities consistent with DIC. Out of the 9 cases of AML showing DIC, 63 (66.67%) belonged to APL (FAB ME) subtype. Three (60%) out of 5 cases of ALL with DIC had T-cell immunophenotype. The results indicate that DIC may also occur in types of AL other than APL, particularly in T-ALL, and should be looked for.\n",
      "It is apparent that treatment of Hodgkin disease can be complicated by the development of secondary leukaemia. Most such leukaemias are of the non-lymphocytic type. We describe here a patient treated for Hodgkin disease with chemo- and radiotherapy who developed secondary acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with a non-random chromosomal abnormality t(4;11). The frequency of such cases is assessed by a literature review and evidence for their pluripotent cell origin is discussed.\n",
      "The refusal of Jehovah Witnesses with leukaemia to accept transfusion provides a major clinical challenge because of the myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy. Experience in treating five such patients is described. Two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) achieved remission following chemotherapy, the first without transfusion support, the second, a minor, receiving transfusion under a court order: the first patient remains in remission 5 years later, whereas the second subsequently relapsed and died. Of three patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), two received chemotherapy: one died of anaemia during induction chemotherapy whereas the second eventually consented to transfusion but died of refractory leukaemia. The third patient died of anaemia despite erythropoietin. We feel Jehovah Witnesses should not be denied antileukaemic therapy if they fully understand the risks involved. Minimizing phlebotomy, use of antifibrinolytic agents and growth factors may make chemotherapy feasible, especially in ALL where remission may be induced with less myelosuppressive agents. The outlook for those with AML treated with conventional chemotherapy appears poor; alternative approaches to treatment should be considered in these patients.\n",
      "Of 535 consecutive cases of acute leukaemia diagnosed in the Cape Province between 1978 and 1985, demographic data are incomplete in 75 black patients and they have had to be excluded from the spatial analysis. Of the remaining 460 cases, 223 (48.5%) occurred in white patients and 237 (51.5%) in those of mixed ancestry, classified as coloureds according to the Population Registration Act No. 30 of 1950. The average incidence was 2.12, 1.37 and 0.58/100,000 for whites, coloureds and blacks respectively. There was no temporal trend in the incidence of acute leukaemia between the three race groups. The median age for whites was 30 years and for the coloureds was 15 years, which is comparable to the 16 years for the black patients. The two-peak age distribution for leukaemia was seen in the white group, but was absent in the other two groups. This is accounted for by a different distribution in non-lymphoblastic as opposed to lymphoblastic subtypes. Furthermore, there was a disproportionately high frequency of acute progranulocytic leukaemia in the black patients, whereas the white and coloured groups were similar. There was a single, clearly defined macro-scale cluster restricted to white patients in Statistical Region 17 (SR-17). This exploratory study provides the first epidemiologic data for acute leukaemia in the Cape Province. It needs to be extended in order to verify these observations under more controlled circumstances and to seek evidence for some environmental factors that may account for the geographical cluster.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986 released large quantities of radioactive material causing widespread contamination. In the Ukraine alone, more than 4 million people were exposed to radiation. The exact health consequences of this exposure are still being assessed. METHODS: To ascertain the effect of in utero radiation exposure and the development of leukaemia, a review was undertaken of leukaemia sub-types occurring among children born in the year of the accident (1986) and followed 10 years post-exposure. A comparison was made of leukaemia cumulative incidence rates among children from both an exposed and unexposed oblast. RESULTS: Rate ratios (RR) for the all cell types grouping of leukaemia revealed that rates in the exposed Oblast were significantly elevated for females, males and both genders combined. Rates of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were dramatically elevated for males and to a lesser extent for females. For both genders combined, the RR for ALL was more than three times greater in the exposed compared to the unexposed region. CONCLUSION: Study results suggest that the increased risk of leukaemia and acute leukaemia among those children born in 1986 and resident in radioactively contaminated territories may be associated with exposure to radiation resulting from the Chernobyl accident.\n",
      "The effect of retinoic acid (RA) alone and in combination with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) on differentiation of fresh human myeloid leukaemic cells from patients with AML was studied. Cells from six patients: three with acute myelomonocytic leukaemia AMMoL and three with acute monoblastic leukaemia AMoL with a percentage of blasts greater than 70, were treated in an in vitro primary suspension culture with retinoic acid (10(-7) M), cytosine arabinoside (100 ng/ml) or both in combination. Non-adherent mononuclear cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 x 10(5) cells/ml in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 20 per cent fetal bovine serum and 10 per cent (PHA-LCM) phytohaemagglutinin leucocyte conditioned medium and incubated for 6 days at 37 degrees C in a humidified incubator containing 5 per cent CO2 in air. Morphological and functional differentiation into terminal mature elements was induced in all leukaemia cells of the six patients following exposure to the combination of both agents. These results suggest the potential usefulness of the combination of a differentiating agent (retinoic acid) and an antileukaemic drug (cytosine arabinoside) in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemias: AMMoL and AMoL. This combination warrants a clinical trial.\n",
      "Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillary blood vessels, is a central regulator of cancer growth, and a validated target for cancer therapy. The antiangiogenic agents in clinical use target one or more cellular pathways involved in the cascade of vascular growth. In haematological malignancies, angiogenesis occurs within a bone marrow ecosystem comprised of closely apposed malignant cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, endothelial progenitor cells, dendritic cells, and extracellular matrix. Inhibition of angiogenesis therefore blocks not only the delivery of oxygen and micronutrients to cancer cells, but also disrupts the interdependency of these cellular players and the paracrine effects they exert to maintain the malignant phenotype. Agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and bevacizumab, have demonstrated clinical activity in myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and leukaemias. In leukaemia, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is emerging as a compelling biological target for therapy, as well as a potential predictive marker for disease relapse. Initial clinical studies suggest that the anti-VEGF strategies may advance the primary, sequential or adjunctive treatment for leukaemia, and establish the basis for other potential antiangiogenic strategies in haematological malignancies.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Whilst Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is considered a rare disease, to our knowledge, the current prevalence of CLL within the European Union (EU) member states is not published. Understanding the number of individuals with CLL is vital to assess disease burden within the wider population. METHODS: Using 2002 data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, we estimated the number of individuals with CLL (ICD-10 C91.1) from those reported for all leukaemias (C91-95) and extrapolated the figures by the population increase within the EU between 2002 and 2006, the last year with fully updated community population estimates. One- and 5-yr partial prevalence estimates are reported (i.e. the number of individuals still living 1-5 yr post-diagnosis). We then applied proportional estimates from the literature to assess those requiring immediate treatment, those under observation and their likely progression rates. RESULTS: We found that within the 27 EU states plus Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein, 1- and 5-yr CLL partial prevalence estimates totalled approximately 13,952 and 46,633 individuals respectively in 2006. By applying Binet staging to the 1-yr estimate, 40% of patients will be stage B/C and require immediate treatment. Thus, 5581 individuals may be treated within the first year of diagnosis. Of the 60% (8371) under observation, by 5 yr up to 33% (2763) may have more advanced disease with increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: Whilst CLL is a rare disease, the number of individuals burdened by the disease within the EU is considerable and thousands of patients require treatment and physician care, which has cost implications for member states.\n",
      "Mature (post-thymic) T-cell malignancies comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases with distinct clinical, morphological and immunophenotypic features. As some of these features overlap in the various disorders, it is essential to use a number of diagnostic criteria to define the clinicopathological entities, namely: membrane markers, morphology by light and electron microscopy, clinical features, seroepidemiology of HTLV-I, histopathology, cytogenetic studies and DNA analysis. The latter, which is necessary to document clonality and confirm T-lineage, examines the rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta, gamma and delta genes. By means of this multiparameter approach, it is possible to distinguish within the post-thymic leukaemias 4 disease entities: T-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or large granular lymphocyte leukaemia, T-prolymphocytic leukaemia, adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma and Sézary syndrome.\n",
      "The authors refer about an unusual localization of haemorrhage to the adrenal glands, observed in two patients with acute leukaemia similar to the picture of Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. This complication causing serious and dramatic effects should be taken into differential diagnostic consideration. Literature data and own results are given in order to review the general characteristics of bleeding in acute leukaemia.\n",
      "Pooled analyses have consistently displayed an association of childhood leukaemia with residential magnetic fields, even after attempting to account for study problems. In light of the serious possibility that the link is indeed causal, a study of possible joint effects (interactions) of magnetic fields and genetic cofactors on childhood leukaemia may be justifiable. Such a study would face serious obstacles of limited numbers for subgroup analysis. To address these obstacles, we describe a design and analysis strategy that combines multiphase (multistage) sampling, measurement error modelling, and Bayesian methods for subgroup analysis that incorporate information from earlier pooled analyses. Special attention is given to prior specification, which would be the potentially controversial element. The approach could be pilot tested on data from the Danish National Birth Cohort, but an informative study would require augmenting these data with case-control sampling. We conclude that the approach outlined may be of value not only for this topic but also in other studies of effects of rare exposures and genetic factors on rare outcomes.\n",
      "Chromosome translocations are often early or initiating events in leukaemogenesis, occurring prenatally in most cases of childhood leukaemia. Although these genetic changes are necessary, they are usually not sufficient to cause leukaemia. How, when and where do translocations arise? And can these insights aid our understanding of the natural history, pathogenesis and causes of leukaemia?\n",
      "The analysis was performed on bone marrow cells derived from 96 patients with acute leukaemia (AL): 76 with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and 20 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Aberrations of chromosome 7 were revealed in 20 (21%) of 96 analysed cases: in 14 (18%) with AML and in six (30%) with ALL. Structural aberrations, present in 13 patients (eight with AML and five with ALL), were unbalanced and led to partial monosomy (12 cases) or trisomy (four cases) of chromosome 7. Twelve (86%) out of 14 AML and all the ALL patients with chromosome 7 aberrations had complex karyotypes in their bone marrow cells. Monosomy 7 and 7q losses were frequently observed in the AML group, whereas, in the ALL group, gains in 7q and losses in the short arms constituted most chromosome 7 aberrations. The occurrence of monosomy, or of losses in 7q, results in a worse response to induction therapy in AML patients. The complete remission (CR) rate was significantly lower in this group in comparison to the group of AML patients with a normal karyotype (p = 0.01) in bone marrow cells.\n",
      "Interferon-alpha is an effective agent in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia and hairy cell leukaemia. Because interferon-alpha does not inhibit DNA synthesis, we have used it to treat these diseases during pregnancy. We report here two patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia and two patients with hairy cell leukaemia managed with interferon-alpha during pregnancy. Interferon-alpha was well tolerated, and the pregnancies proceeded without complications. All four infants were apparently normal at birth, and all four have enjoyed normal growth and development. Interferon-alpha may represent relatively safe therapy during pregnancy, because of its lack of inhibition of DNA synthesis. Nevertheless, recommendations regarding the use of interferon-alpha to treat chronic leukaemias during pregnancy must await further experience with this agent in this setting.\n",
      "Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia. We report a patient with acute basophilic leukaemia with 47, XXY karyotype in both the tumour and constitutional cells. Acute basophilic leukaemia is very rare disease comprising less than 1% of all acute myeloid leukaemias. Morphological characteristic of leukaemic blast cells is moderately basophilic cytoplasm containing a variable number of coarse basophilic granules. The most characteristic cytochemical reaction is metachromatic positivity with toluidine blue. Blast are myeloperoxidase negative. Also leukemic blasts express myeloid and monocyte markers. There is no consistent chromosomal abnormality identified in this leukaemia. This is the first reported case of acute basophilic leukaemia in patient with Klinefelter syndrome. In this article the medical history of the patient is given and the possible connection between Klinefelter syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia is discussed.\n",
      "Chemotherapy resistance from imbalanced apoptosis regulation may contribute to poor outcome in leukaemias with t(4;11). Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 expression and target modulation were characterized in cell lines with t(4;11) and BCL-2 expression was examined in MLL and non-MLL infant/paediatric leukaemia cases by Western blot analysis and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cytotoxicity of Genasensetrade mark (Oblimersen Sodium, G3139) alone or combined with cytotoxic drugs was assessed by MTT [(3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assays of the cell lines, applying pharmacostatistical response surface modelling of drug interactions. Apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry in RS4:11 cells. Primary leukaemias and cell lines with t(4;11) expressed abundant BCL2 mRNA and protein. Variable, sometimes substantial BCL2 mRNA was detected in other leukaemia subtypes. G3139 reduced BCL2 mRNA and protein in RS4:11 cells. The most sensitive cell line to single-agent G3139 was RS4:11. Low G3139 concentrations sensitized RS4:11 and MV4-11 cells to select anti-leukaemia cytotoxic drugs. In RS4:11 cells, combining G3139 with doxorubicin (ADR) increased active caspase 3 and TUNEL staining compared to ADR alone, indicating greater apoptosis, and G3139 increased S-phase progression. The abundant BCL-2 affords a molecular target in leukaemias with t(4;11). G3139 exhibits preclinical activity and synergy with select cytotoxic agents in RS4:11 and MV4-11 cells, and these effects occur through apoptosis.\n",
      "The pattern of immune system gene rearrangements in acute leukaemias of childhood is heterogeneous. The biological significance of this heterogeneity in childhood acute leukaemia is still poorly understood. In this study, we analysed 49 children with acute leukaemia (29 B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 5 relapsed cALL, 6 T-ALL, 7 acute non-lymphocytic (ANLL) and 2 mixed lineage leukaemias), for the presence of different immune system gene rearrangements (Ig JH, C kappa, C lambda, TCR J gamma, C beta, J delta and J alpha) by Southern blot hybridisation. The most prominent heterogeneity of immune system gene rearrangements was observed in the group of B-precursor ALL. The results from our study suggest that the heterogeneity of immune system gene rearrangement reflects clonal diversity in approximately one-third of patients with B-precursor ALL at presentation and in most patients in relapse. The observed association of clonal diversity with high white blood cell count, pre-B immunophenotype and age under 1 year in B-precursor ALL may have clinical significance. There was a significantly shorter disease-free survival in the group of B-precursor ALL patients with clonal diversity compared with those without clonal diversity. Clonal diversity may, therefore, be a mechanism of disease progression common to different types of aggressive B-precursor ALL.\n",
      "Proteinase 3 (P3) is a serine proteinase present in the primary granules of neutrophils. We have investigated the expression of this protein in samples of bone marrow from healthy individuals and patients with different types of leukaemias by using immunocytochemical staining and flow cytometric quantitation. In normal bone marrow the enzyme was found in promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band forms and polymorphonuclear neutrophils, correlating with the synthesis of neutrophil serine proteinases during myeloid maturation. No staining was found within the lymphoid, erythroid and megakaryocytic lineage. In the leukaemic samples, only those of acute myeloid and chronic myeloid leukaemia patients were labelled with the antiproteinase 3 antibody. Cases of acute lymphoblastic and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, as well as other malignant lymphomas, were consistently negative, indicating that P3 may be used as a specific marker for the discrimination between myeloid and lymphoid leukaemias. In addition, immunoreactivity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was investigated and the expression of P3 and MPO correlated with the French-American-British (FAB) classification. P3 was not detected in minimally differentiated M0 and M1 cases but was in predominantly labelled cells of M2 and M3 subtypes plus half of the M4 and one out of six M5 cases but not those of M6. These findings correspond to the differentiation stage in which P3 is expressed and stored in the primary granules. Therefore the enzyme may also be used as an adjunct to the classic morphological and cytochemical methods to elucidate further the stage at which the differentiation arrest of the leukaemic clone has occurred.\n",
      "The European Bone Marrow Transplant Leukaemia Registry has collected data from 52 European centers between 1979 and 1986. More than 2,000 transplants performed for a haematological malignancy were reported. The present analysis shows that the most important factor influencing leukaemia free survival, transplant related mortality and relapse incidence is the stage of the disease at the time of the transplant. Outcome is highly better when the transplant is performed for acute myeloid and acute lymphocytic leukaemia in first complete remission and for chronic myelocytic leukaemia in first chronic phase. Additional prognostic factors are age, the method for graft-versus-host disease prevention and the donor recipient sex combination. Results are better for younger patients, for patients given cyclosporine for prevention of graft-versus-host disease and are worse for male patients receiving a female donor bone marrow. The results are not influenced by the year of the transplant per se and by the center size.\n",
      "Two patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) relapsed 1.5 and 5 years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Although the leukaemias were of recipient origin, t(9;22) could no longer be detected using conventional cytogenetics/fluorescence in situ hybridization or molecularly. Both patients responded to immunotherapy with donor lymphocytes/peripheral blood stem cells, although one patient ultimately relapsed again. These patients were similar to the occurrence of Ph(-) leukaemias previously described in Ph(+) CML after treatment with interferon or autologous BMT, and might be relevant in the pathogenesis and monitoring of treatment after BMT in CML.\n",
      "Arbitrarily primed-PCR analysis of DNA from male CBA/H radiation-induced leukaemic spleens revealed the loss of an approximately 350-bp sequence in several leukaemias. We have isolated a lambda EMBL3 C57BL/6 genomic subclone (pJB1) which hybridizes to the AP-PCR probe and is located on the Y chromosome. Southern blot analyses using the pJB1 probe indicate that the genomic sequence was deleted in five of 14 leukaemias. Cytogenetic analyses of 31 X-ray induced leukaemias in male CBA/H mice revealed, in addition to the characteristic partial deletion of chromosome 2 (28/31 leukaemias), a high incidence (16/31) of the loss of an intact Y chromosome. Comparison of the Southern blot and cytogenetic analyses of the leukaemias demonstrate a significant lack of correspondence between the loss of an intact Y chromosome and Y chromosome-specific DNA sequences, suggesting that Y chromosome aberrations are complex. Whereas partial deletion of chromosome 2 can be detected in 6% of bone marrow cells within 6-11 days of irradiation, no Y chromosome involvement was detected, indicating that Y chromosome aberrations are a late event in radiation-induced leukaemogenesis. These findings are comparable to the loss of sex chromosomes in human t(8;21) AML.\n",
      "The expression of the P-glycoprotein which is associated with the development of multidrug resistance in various cell lines was investigated in 87 fresh acute leukaemia and multiple myeloma samples using the specific mouse monoclonal antibody MRK16 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Considering a 10% positive cell cut-off value, a heterogeneous expression of P-glycoprotein was observed in 5/22 (22.7%) de novo acute leukaemias, 7/22 (31.8%) relapse or secondary acute leukaemias, 14/27 (51.8%) acute transformation of myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndromes and 5/16 (31.2%) multiple myelomas. This expression was not associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, especially alterations of chromosome 7q. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, has been demonstrated to circumvent the multidrug resistance in cell lines, possibly by interfering with P-glycoprotein function. Using the microculture tetrazolium assay, verapamil was demonstrated to increase the sensitivity of fresh leukaemic or myeloma cells to doxorubicin in 19/43 (43.1%) samples. The doxorubicin IC50 level and the capacity of verapamil to increase the sensitivity of blast cells to doxorubicin in vitro did not correlate with the expression of P-glycoprotein. We conclude that high non-cytotoxic concentrations of verapamil were able to increase the in vitro doxorubicin sensitivity of fresh acute leukaemia and myeloma cells without detectable expression of the P-glycoprotein.\n",
      "The biosynthesis of neolacto glycosphingolipids is thought to proceed via reactions catalysed by the two enzymes beta 1-3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (beta 1,3GlcNAcT) and beta 1-4 galactosyltransferase (beta 1,4GalT). In general, only the products of the latter enzyme have been isolated from tissues and structurally characterized. Among the GlcNAc beta 1-3-R glycosphingolipids, only lactotrioasylceramide (Lc3Cer, the initial product in the biosynthesis of neolacto glycosphingolipids) has been isolated and structurally characterized. Longer-chain glycosphingolipids with a terminal GlcNAc-beta 1-3-R structure are considered to be intermediates in the synthesis of complex neolacto glycosphingolipids. We have detected a series of GlcNAc beta 1-3-R glycosphingolipids in extracts obtained from human leukocytes isolated from patients with leukaemia using a monoclonal antibody (TE5) which specifically recognizes these compounds. The structures of three of these compounds purified from chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) cells have been determined using a combination of enzymatic, immunostaining and chemical methods. The compounds were found to have the following structures: GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer (Lc3Cer) GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer (nLc5Cer) GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer (nLc7Cer) A longer-chain compound, apparently nLc9Cer, was also detected. TLC immunostaining analysis of glycosphingolipids isolated from cells obtained from patients with various leukaemias demonstrated that GlcNAc beta 1-3-R glycosphingolipids have a distribution that depends on the stage of differentiation and lineage of the cell population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were to determine the spectrum of the clinical and pathological findings, the management and prognosis of patients of transient myeloproliferative syndrome (TMS) and congenital leukaemia. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The study was conducted over a period of 8 years, from January 2000 to December 2007, at the Children Hospital and the Institute of Child Health, Lahore. METHODOLOGY: Suspected patients presenting with fever, pallor, bruises and hepatosplenomegaly and diagnosed as either transient myeloproliferative disorder or congenital leukaemia were studied. The complete blood count, reticulocyte count, leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score, liver function tests, karyotyping studies and bone marrow aspiration biopsy were performed in all of those patients. Management and out come was noted. Results were described as frequency percentages. RESULTS: Out of 10,000 patients presenting during this period, 24 patients were diagnosed as either of transient myeloproliferative syndrome or congenital leukaemia. Fifteen of these were diagnosed as patients of TMS and 9 as patients of congenital leukaemia. Down syndrome (DS) was diagnosed in 75% of these patients. TMS patients were put on supportive treatment and recovered spontaneously. One DS patient with congenital leukaemia went into spontaneous remission and 2 of DS patients with congenital leukaemia responded to chemotherapy while rest of them either died or lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: TMS and congenital leukaemia were not very uncommon in the studied population. Majority had Down syndrome. It is important to differentiate their clinical and pathological presentations for proper management. TMS may resolve with supportive treatment while congenital leukaemia is a fatal condition requiring chemotherapy.\n",
      "Aneuploidy is considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of malignancies. We were interested whether abnormalities of the sister-chromatid separation regulator and proto-oncogene hSecurin occurred in myeloid leukaemias, and whether such abnormalities correlated with aneuploidy. The expression of hSecurin was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR in samples from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n=70), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP, n=20) or blast phase (BP, n=12), and granulocytes as well as mononuclear cells (MNCs) from healthy donors (n=21). Median hSecurin expression in AML with normal karyotypes was not significantly different from AML showing aneuploidy, CML BP or cells from healthy donors. However, hSecurin expression in CML CP was significantly increased compared to AML with normal karyotypes (1.82-fold; P<0.001), CML BP (3.18-fold; P<0.001), MNCs (3.17-fold; P<0.001) and granulocytes (2.69 fold; P<0.001) from healthy donors. Mutations in the coding region of hSecurin were not detected. These results do not support a major role of hSecurin in the development of aneuploidy in myeloid leukaemias. However, high expression of hSecurin may be of pathogenetic relevance in a subset of patients with regard to its potential to stimulate angiogenesis and to interact with the DNA-damage response pathway.\n",
      "Both ionizing radiation and alkylating chemicals are used to treat cancer, and both are themselves carcinogenic. Epidemiological methods of study have provided a substantial amount of information on the long-term risks of the two types of treatment. Radiotherapy appears to increase the risk of a wide range of cancers, but the size of the increase is not substantial. Chemotherapy, in contrast, produces a very large increase in the risk of acute leukaemia, and does not generally appear to produce other types of cancer. Leukaemias following both treatment modalities appear rapidly, while the risk of solid tumours induced by radiotherapy is not manifested until a decade or more has elapsed. There does not seem to be synergy between the two types of therapy in their carcinogenic action. Continued use of the epidemiological approach is essential in risk-benefit evaluation of cancer therapy.\n",
      "The MLL gene from human chromosome 11q23 is involved in >30 different chromosomal translocations resulting in a plethora of different MLL fusion proteins. Each of these tends to associate with a specific leukaemia type, for example, MLL-AF9 is found mainly in acute myeloid leukaemia. We have studied the role of the Mll-AF9 gene fusion made in mouse embryonic stem cells by an homologous recombination knock-in. Acute leukaemias developed in heterozygous mice carrying this fusion as well as in chimeric mice. As with human chromosomal translocation t(9;11), the majority of cases were acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) involving immature myeloblasts, but a minority were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The AMLs were preceded by effects on haematopoietic differentiation involving a myeloproliferation resulting in accumulation of Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positive mature myeloid cells in bone marrow as early as 6 days after birth. Therefore, non-malignant expansion of myeloid precursors is the first stage of Mll-AF9-mediated leukaemia followed by accumulation of malignant cells in bone marrow and other tissues. Thus, the late onset of overt tumours suggests that secondary tumorigenic mutations are necessary for malignancy associated with MLL-AF9 gene fusion and that myeloproliferation provides the pool of cells in which such events can occur.\n",
      "We have studied the expression of antigens characterizing functional T-cell subsets in 32 CD4+ mature T-cell leukaemias. In this analysis we used two monoclonal antibodies (McAb) of the CD45R group (2H4 and GRT22) which have been shown to identify the 'native/virgin' T-cell population that functions as uppressor-inducer' cells in vitro, and two McAb, CD29 (4B4) and CD45RO (UCHL1), which characterize non-identical 'memory' cells that proliferate in response to soluble recall antigens and provide help in antigen-specific IgG synthesis. Four groups of CD4+ cases were identified according to this reactivity: (a) 15 CD45R+, CD29+; (b) 13 CD45R-, CD29+; (c) three CD45R-, CD29-; and (d) one case only CD45+, CD29-. The high incidence of coexpression of CD45R and CD29 (47% of cases) is a new finding which contrasts with the mutual exclusion of these antigens on normal CD4+ T-lymphocytes. There was no correlation between subset phenotypes and pathological disease entities. None of the six cases of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL), which is known as a disorder of activated uppressor-inducer' cells, had the 'expected' CD45R+, CD29- phenotype. Reactivity with UCHL1 showed a good correlation with CD29 in the CD45R- CD29+ cases which included three with ATLL. These results may help in the further characterization of T-cell malignancies according to functional subgroups and may clarify further the role of T-differentiation antigens in health and disease.\n",
      "The provirus DNA isolated from lymphocytes of a cow infected with the bovine leukaemia virus (BLV; positive immunodiffusion test), was subjected to molecular cloning and identified by comparing with the 32P-labelled provirus cDNA isolated in Belgium. Hybridization revealed a clone containing 8.5 kb DNA fragment of the BLV provirus. The probe based on the \"Polish fragment\" of leukaemia virus was tested on 10 cows with a positive serological response. The presence of provirus DNA in the cellular genome of lymphocytes was confirmed.\n",
      "Leukaemia is the most common cancer of childhood. Most children with a new diagnosis of leukaemia are clinically stable at initial presentation. However, there are a number of life-threatening complications that have to be considered and monitored for. These complications include sepsis, tumour lysis syndrome, mediastinal masses, bleeding and pain. The aim of this article is to equip the general paediatrician with a framework for managing children with suspected leukaemia, prior to transfer to the primary treatment centre. The presentation, diagnosis and definitive treatment of acute leukaemia is not in the remit of this article.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease(SCD) is a disorder of red cells resulting from the co-inheritance of haemoglobin S (HbS) with another abnormal haemoglobin. The diagnosis of acute leukaemia is uncommon in our patients with sickle cell disease more so the patients have high morbidity and mortality due to the sickling process. Acute leukemia is a malignant clonal disorder of haemopoietic precursor cells resulting in accumulation of immature blood cells in the bone marrow and blood. The objective of the case series was to highlight the challenges of diagnosis and management of SCD patients with acute leukaemia, the importance of peripheral blood film review and propound a possible risk factor. METHODS: Records of 58 patients diagnosed and managed for acute leukaemia over a 7 year period at the University College Hospital, Ibadan were reviewed. The diagnosis of acute leukaemia was based on clinical features in addition to peripheral and bone marrow smears findings. Microsoft excel version 2013 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Five (8.6%) of the patients with acute leukaemia also had sickle cell disease: 3 males and 2 females were described. Recurrent fever and anaemia were the most consistent presenting features in the patients. All the patients were not on any routine medications meant for SCD patients and had poor history of clinic attendance prior to the diagnosis of acute leukaemia. The diagnosis of acute leukaemia was not made until the patients were seen by a haematologist. The principal tool of diagnosis in all the patients was peripheral blood film review. Two patients were discharged against medical advice. The treatment period ranged between one month and one year in the remaining three patients. CONCLUSION: SCD patients are not exempted from developing acute leukaemias and the diagnoses of the two conditions overwhelms the social and economic support of patients and care givers. The study also underscores the relevance of high level of suspicion and prompt review of peripheral blood film of SCD patients particularly when patients present with unremitting symptoms associated with anaemia and fever.\n",
      "Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key enzyme involved in folate metabolism, DNA methylation and synthesis. We investigated the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and the risks of acute and chronic leukaemias. MTHFR C677T and A1298C were genotyped in 396 Korean individuals using multiplex polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment-length polymorphism. They were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, n = 89), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 55), biphenotypic acute leukaemia (n = 12), chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML, n = 40), and normal controls (n = 200). C677T genotypes were not associated with the risk of each disease. A1298C variants, however, significantly decreased the risks of ALL and CML compared with 1298AA. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of 1298AC and 1298AC + CC were 0.53 (0.31-0.93) and 0.54 (0.31-0.93) in ALL, and 0.34 (0.14-0.80) and 0.40 (0.18-0.89) in CML, respectively, compared with 1298AA. These findings demonstrate that the development of ALL and CML is more dependent on folate status, and more susceptible to DNA instability than that of AML. In addition, A1298C rather than C677T may be a more important genetic risk modifier in leukaemogenesis at least in the Korean population.\n",
      "AIMS: Pure erythroid leukaemia (PEL) is an extremely rare and aggressive subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a neoplastic proliferation of immature cells committed exclusively to the erythroid lineage, comprising >80% of bone marrow cells and not meeting the criteria of other well-defined myeloid neoplasms. The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathological features of acute leukaemias with a pure erythroid phenotype (ALPEP) irrespective of their WHO classification and to determine if ALPEP represents a distinct clinicopathological entity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified seven cases of ALPEP, in which immature cells fulfilled WHO morphological and immunophenotypical criteria for PEL. All patients except one were male, with a median age of 60 years. Three cases represented de novo PEL, three were therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and one was a blast phase of a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Extensive tumour necrosis was present in five cases (71%). Five cases with available modal karyotypes all demonstrated a complex karyotype involving the TP53 gene locus, with three cases (60%) also showing a monosomy 5 or deletion 5q and additional material on chromosome 19q13. All patients died of their disease, with a mean overall survival of 189 and 64.7 days in cases without and with necrosis on the initial biopsy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We describe previously unreported but relatively common findings of extensive tumour necrosis and recurring cytogenetic abnormalities in ALPEP. Our findings suggest strongly that ALPEP represents a distinct clinicopathological entity regardless of its WHO classification.\n",
      "The levels of several potential indicators of resistance to cytostatic drugs were measured in leukaemic cells of a total of 64 adult patients with acute or chronic leukaemias before and during treatment and at relapse or recurrence of disease and compared with those of mononuclear cells from the bone marrow of healthy donors. The resistance factors included glutathione (GSH) and its associated enzymes glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as well as O6-alkyguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase) and P-glycoprotein. Median values for most parameters were significantly higher in leukaemic cells than in those of normal donors although wide interindividual variation in the values of the various parameters, particularly GST, were seen. P-glycoprotein was measurable in 12.5% of untreated leukaemias but in none of the normal donors. The values of the parameters in untreated leukaemic patients were not statistically different from those at relapse or during disease progression. However, the median values for GSH, GST and GPx but not ATase in samples from untreated patients were significantly higher than those in samples taken during drug treatment. Patient response, disease-free survival or duration of remission did not correlate with the values of any of the parameters studied.\n",
      "A leukaemia presenting with two morphologically different blast populations failed to respond to either antimyeloid or antilymphoid treatment and showed a rapid clinical progression. Immunophenotyping provided good evidence for two blast populations, one lymphoid and the other lymphoid with granulocyte monocytic markers. Two different gene rearrangements within JH were also observed with band densities corresponding to the sizes of the two blast cell populations. A t(19; 22) translocation was observed in almost all cells at presentation one of which evolved into a subclone, becoming dominant in the terminal phase of the disease. We show here both the clonal evolution and clonal competition that occurred in this leukaemia and suggest that the potential of the tumour stem line for rapidly producing diversity was the reason for the resistance to treatment.\n",
      "By screening for immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements in bone marrow samples aspirated at different time points during the course of disease from 43 patients with acute leukaemia we have analysed the extent of clonal evolution after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) and addressed the issue of whether the Southern Blot method has the power to reveal clonal proliferations representing minimal residual disease (MRD) in the autologous bone marrow grafts. Our results show that no clonal proliferations were detectable in any of the 43 bone marrow grafts analysed, even after we analysed DNA preparations in 5 cases from cells highly enriched for cells of the original malignant immunophenotype. Moreover, as judged by the Ig- and TCR gene configurations in 11 patients, relapse arose from the original clone even though minor clonal variations did occur in about half of the relapsing patients. We conclude that while the Southern Blot method can detect gene receptor rearrangements in the majority of patients with acute leukaemias and high-grade non-Hodgkins lymphomas, it is not useful for predicting relapse after ABMT. On the other hand, it is possible-by employing it-to evaluate whether or not relapse after ABMT arises from the original malignant clone and to what extent clonal evolution has taken place.\n",
      "The cytogenetic analysis of haematological malignancies plays a major role in diagnosis. A large number of non-random chromosomal abnormalities are associated with specific types of leukaemia. Often, the cytogenetic result provides the definitive diagnosis. The recent developments in molecular cytogenetic technologies, in association with conventional cytogenetic analysis, have improved the accuracy of the results and led to the finding of new chromosomal abnormalities in leukaemia. Patients may be monitored by cytogenetics, molecular techniques and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) during the course of their management, for evidence of minimal residual disease. These techniques also provide a useful method for monitoring patients following bone marrow transplantation, particularly when the patient and the donor are of the opposite sex. The cytogenetic result is an independent prognostic indicator, with certain karyotypes associated with a good prognosis, although others indicate a poor outcome.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence and survival of acute de novo leukaemias with particular reference to political/socio-economic and environmental factors in two neighbouring countries over the three 5-year periods (1982-1996). PATIENTS: The present report covers only patients diagnosed when aged > or =65 years. SETTING: A well-defined area of Sweden, the so-called Western Swedish Health Care Region and Estonia. Population-wise, the western Swedish Region and Estonia are very similar; area-wise they are also well comparable. RESULTS: The number of acute de novo leukaemias was quite dissimilar in the two countries (Estonia, n = 137, Sweden, n = 354). The age standardized incidence rates regarding the total number of acute de novo leukaemias was 5.31 per 100,000 inhabitants/year for Estonia and 7.99 for Sweden, this difference being statistically significant. However, the difference was merely attributable to incidence rates as regards acute myeloblastic leukaemias (AML); on the contrary, differences as regards acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL) and non-classifiable, undifferentiated or biphenotypic acute leukaemias (uAL) were negligible. The relative survival for the total material of patients was significantly higher for Swedish when compared with Estonian patients (P < 0.001). Thus, the relative survival for the total material of patients aged > or =65 years in Estonia at 1 year was 8.5% and at 3 years 3.5% respectively. The corresponding figures for the Swedish patients were considerably higher, 22.7 and 7.7% respectively. This difference, however, applied only for patients with AML (P < 0.001), whereas the results for patients with ALL and uAL were equally dismal. CONCLUSION: The results clearly reflect how political and socio-economic factors may influence the survival of acute leukemia patients in two neighbouring countries.\n",
      "The use of intelligent techniques in medicine has brought a ray of hope in terms of treating leukaemia patients. Personalized treatment uses patient genetic profile to select a mode of treatment. This process makes use of molecular technology and machine learning, to determine the most suitable approach to treating a leukaemia patient. Until now, no reviews have been published from a computational perspective concerning the development of personalized medicine intelligent techniques for leukaemia patients using molecular data analysis. This review studies the published empirical research on personalized medicine in leukaemia and synthesizes findings across studies related to intelligence techniques in leukaemia, with specific attention to particular categories of these studies to help identify opportunities for further research into personalized medicine support systems in chronic myeloid leukaemia. A systematic search was carried out to identify studies using intelligence techniques in leukaemia and to categorize these studies based on leukaemia type and also the task, data source, and purpose of the studies. Most studies used molecular data analysis for personalized medicine, but future advancement for leukaemia patients requires molecular models that use advanced machine-learning methods to automate decision-making in treatment management to deliver supportive medical information to the patient in clinical practice.\n",
      "The cause of acute leukaemia is unknown. Untreated, the disease is generally fatal after a few months. The therapeutic regimen is chemotherapy, and sometimes also bone marrow transplantation, and the aim is to cure the patient. Not only does the person live under pressure from a life-threatening disease with all the physiological complications that therapy can result in, the therapeutic regimen also involves a great psychological effect. The concept of quality of life (QOL) is individual for each person, as is his/her experience of the value of the contents of life. The principal aim of the study was to describe what QOL means to adults with acute leukaemia, not to describe the degree of QOL. The second aim was to give the concept of QOL a theoretical and empirical significance relevant to nursing care. Eight adults with diagnosed acute leukaemia detected in adulthood have been interviewed about their quality of life. The concept was given one superior dimension in all the interviews; positive attitude to life. Below the superior dimension were two further dimensions; interpersonal relationships and autonomy. Different qualities were given below these dimensions, viz. security, support, respect, information and conversation.\n",
      "Infection has long been suspected as a possible factor in the aetiology of leukaemia and lymphoma. If seasonal variation in the onset of disease could be shown in any of the diagnostic subgroups of leukaemia or lymphoma, this would provide supportive evidence of an aetiology linked to exposure to infection. All cases in the Manchester Children Tumour Registry (aged 0-14 years at diagnosis) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL), Hodgkin disease (HD) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) between 1 January 1954 and 31 December 1996 were included in an analysis of seasonal variation in the month of first symptom and the month of diagnosis. Cases of common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (c-ALL) diagnosed from 1979 onwards were also analysed separately. The groups considered for analysis were: all cases of ALL (n = 1070), ALL diagnosed between 18 and 95 months of age (n = 730), ALL diagnosed over 95 months of age (n = 266), c-ALL (n = 309), ANLL (n = 244), all infant acute leukaemias (ALL and ANLL under 18 months; n = 107), HD (n = 166) and NHL (n = 189). Using the Edwards method, both c-ALL and HD demonstrated significant seasonal variation (P = 0.037 and 0.001 respectively) in date of first symptom, with peaks occurring in November and December respectively. Using this method, no indication of seasonal variation was found in the other diagnostic groups for date of first symptom or in any of the diagnostic groups for date of diagnosis. For comparison with a previous study, a further analysis based on date of diagnosis for all ALL cases, using summer-winter ratios, showed a significant summer excess. These results provide supportive evidence for an infectious aetiology for c-ALL and HD, and possibly for all ALL, which warrants further investigation.\n",
      "In order to standardize and assess the quality of immunophenotyping of leukaemias and lymphomas for diagnostic purposes, a cooperative study group in the Netherlands, SIHON, has formulated guidelines for the composition of antibody panels to be applied and guidelines for the interpretation of the marker analysis. To assess the value of these guidelines frozen cell samples of three patients with different haematological malignancies were sent to the 26 participating laboratories twice a year. Here we present the results with respect to the marker analysis and to the immunological diagnosis on 387 samples from 18 patients. A large inter-laboratory variation was seen in the percentage of positive cells for each marker, which influenced the valuation of a marker to be discordant positive in up to 23% and discordant negative in up to 40%. No single major factor could be traced to explain the large variation in the results. However, probably due to the balanced composition of the antibody panel and to the application of the guidelines for interpretation, this variation did not much influence the agreement in immunological diagnosis. In only 13/387 samples (3.3%) differences in the percentage of positive cells caused disagreement in the final diagnosis. In 23 samples (5.9%) the disagreement was due to an incorrect application of the guidelines. Quantitative data of single observations obtained from different laboratories, in which the materials and methods are not standardized, cannot be compared; but standardization of guidelines for marker sets and for interpretation contributes to a high grade of agreement in immunological diagnosis.\n",
      "The aetiology of leukaemias among children is believed to be distinct from that of adults, mainly due to the clearer role for early life exposures, including those in utero. However, few risk factors have been established, because of the challenge of studying a disease with relatively low incidence. Identified risk factors, including ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic agents and specific genetic abnormalities, explain < 10% of incidence. Although the causes for the remaining 90% are unknown, it is possible that genetic susceptibility factors, either alone or in conjunction with environmental factors, may be involved. In this paper, the authors (a) review the evidence surrounding genetic susceptibility factors, with emphasis on the genes' main effects; (b) review some recent developments in the Northern California Childhood Leukaemia Study (NCCLS) as a case study of design and practical considerations in genetic epidemiology research and (c) highlight both challenges and future directions in this exciting research area.\n",
      "Circulating immune complexes (ClC) were estimated in 78 patients of leukaemias and lymphomas by Clq deviation ELISA and PEG assay. In all leukaemias a significant elevation in ClC was seen at the time of first presentation. While in ALL a decrease occurred on therapy as partial or complete remission was achieved, no such fall was seen in AML or CML-BC when treated. ClC levels were much higher in non-Hodgkins lymphoma than in Hodgkins disease and showed a direct correlation with B symptoms and activity of the disease. The ClC levels were highest in null-ALL followed by those in common ALL and T-ALL. The mean duration of remission in patients of ALL without elevation in ClC was much longer than in those with ClC.\n",
      "Previous studies have shown that approximately 30% of adult acute myeloid leukaemias and 20% of adult acute lymphoid leukaemias contain point mutated ras oncogenes. In order to assess whether ras oncogenes are also involved in childhood leukaemias, we have used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and synthetic oligonucleotide probes to study the nature and frequency of ras gene mutations in childhood leukaemias, concentrating largely on the acute myeloid leukaemias (AML). Thirty-four childhood presentation AML DNAs were screened for mutations in and around codons 12, 61 and 117 of N-, K- and H-ras. Eight of these samples (24%) contained ras mutations. As in the adult disease, the gene predominantly involved was N-ras (6/8), with occasional activation of K-ras (2/6). The most common base change was a G----A transition at codon 12 or 13 (4/8). Of the patients with mutant ras, 4/8 were diagnosed as AML FAB subtype M5. Five of the 34 childhood AMLs analysed displayed abnormalities of chromosome 7. However, none of these cases contained a mutant ras gene. One AML patient was studied at relapse, 14 months after initial presentation. The presentation mutation (N61p3) was not detectable, although a new mutation (N13Cys) was readily identified. This observation extends our original finding with presentation and relapse samples of adult AML, in which it was uncommon for the relapse sample to contain the same ras mutation as the presentation DNA. In addition, two out of five patients diagnosed as juvenile CML, were found to harbour mutant ras.\n",
      "'Aleukaemic leukaemia cutis' or acute leukaemia confined to the skin is extremely rare, although skin involvement with underlying leukaemia is well recognized, and is associated with a poor prognosis. We report a case of isolated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in the skin. A literature review shows this to be commonly misdiagnosed. Its recognition is important, because early diagnosis should lead to more appropriate chemotherapy, and a better prognosis. These patients probably require therapy directed specifically to the skin, as well as to other extramedullary sites, such as the central nervous system, to prevent early relapse.\n",
      "Many haematologic malignancies carry characteristic chromosomal translocations, which are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of these tumours. The t(8; 14) translocation in Burkitt lymphoma was one of the first characterized at the molecular level. In this translocation the c-myc oncogene at chromosome 8q24 becomes deregulated by enhancer elements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus at chromosome 14q32 leading to a very aggressive B cell malignancy. Translocations involving an overexpressed c-myc gene are also found in AIDS-associated lymphoma or in T cell leukaemias, or they develop during tumour progression of a low grade B cell malignancy into a high grade B cell tumour in an additional cytogenetic change. A different mechanism of oncogene activation in a leukaemia specific chromosomal abnormality is found for CML, where c-abl sequences are fused into the bcr locus, or in the t(4; 11) of acute childhood leukaemia involving the recently identified ALL-1 gene at chromosome 11q23 resulting in a malfunctioning, structurally altered oncogene. Thus, in the past molecular and somatic cell genetic studies have clarified many details in aetiology and progression of leukaemias and lymphomas which are useful for applications in clinical diagnostics, and which in the future will be helpful in designing a therapy based on a molecular understanding.\n",
      "Leu-M1 is a differentiation antigen present in human myelomonocytic cells. Seventy-seven acute leukaemias were retrospectively stained with anti-Leu-M1 using the immunoperoxidase technique on Bouin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. The subjects were 44 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL) and 33 acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) previously characterized by cytochemical and immunologic (cell suspension) methods. Leu-M1 was positive in all the AML and in half of the ALL cases. These results suggest that Leu-M1 does not allow differentiation between AML and ALL. For the ALL cases Leu-M1 was positive in 15/28 B-cell types, 4/12 T-cell type and 3/4 'null'-cell type cases. Thus, this antibody is of no assistance in defining types B, T, or 'null' in ALL. Leu-M1 was also studied on paraffin sections of 34 high grade malignant lymphomas. The antibody was negative in all 13 B-cell lymphomas (lymphoblastic: 6; immunoblastic: 7) and in all 4 'null' cell lymphomas. It was positive in 4/9 peripheral T-cell type, the other T-cell lymphomas (lymphoblastic: 5; immunoblastic: 3) remaining negative. Thus, Leu-M1 may be positive in T-cell lymphomas but it is negative in B-cell lymphomas and is always negative in B or T lymphoblastic types. It seems that lymphoblasts are Leu-M1 negative in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and may be Leu-M1 positive in leukaemias.\n",
      "The study examined the qualitative, cognitive and psychosocial experiences of those living with leukaemia undergoing treatment at a teaching hospital. Twenty respondents who consented to participate were purposively selected from the cancer patients with leukaemia receiving treatment in the said teaching hospital. The in-depth interview method was used to collect data. The data was analysed using manual content analysis. Data showed that patients lack basic knowledge about leukaemia and had no beliefs regarding leukaemia. Some patients believed in God and a medical breakthrough for a cure, while for some, the hope of living was not certain. The ill-health condition had brought about financial predicament to both patients and family members and has limited their productivity in terms of income-generating activities. Good interpersonal relationships and support from their care providers aided their compliance to treatment regime and provided hope for living positively with their condition. The study concludes that there is a need to educate the patients on the causes of their condition. Financial supports should be rendered to those living with leukaemia, while health care providers should be encouraged to continue to maintain good interpersonal relationships with their patients.\n",
      "Aleukaemic leukaemia cutis is a rare condition characterized by infiltration of leukaemic cells into the skin before they appear in the peripheral blood. We report a case of an aleukaemic leukaemia cutis, which had a history of exposure to atomic bomb radiation. A 57-year-old Japanese woman initially presented with a 20-week history of multiple red papules and plaques mainly over the trunk. Histological examination revealed the infiltration of atypical monocytic cells in the dermis, but no leukaemic cells were detected in the peripheral blood. Twenty-three weeks after the appearance of the eruption, leukaemic cells were detected in the peripheral blood for the first time. The results of immunohistochemistry of the skin biopsy specimen and flow cytometry of the peripheral blood indicated the rare phenotype of myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukaemia. This is the first case report of myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukaemia presenting as aleukaemic leukaemia cutis in the English literature, and awareness of this clinical presentation may be important to reach the correct diagnosis.\n",
      "Six new analogues of nitrosoureas containing aroylhydrazine residue have been synthesized: (I) 4-(2-fluorobenzoyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosohydrazinecarboxamide++ +; (II) 4-(4-bromobenzoyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosohydrazinecarboxam ide; (III) 4-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosohydrazinecarboxamide+ ++; (IV) 4-(3-methoxybenzoyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosohydrazinecarbox amide; (V) 4-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosohydrazinecarbox amide; (VI) 4-(4-fluorophenylacetyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosohydrazineca rboxamide. All six compounds showed a dose-dependent in vivo activity against leukaemias L1210 and P388. Compounds I and III were soluble in water. The antitumour effects were highly expressed in compound III, yielding a T/C% value of 402% in leukaemia P388, and in compound VI, 356% in leukaemia L1210.\n",
      "Seventy patients with lymphomas and leukaemias were interviewed. Details of past acne vulgaris were recorded and a clinical examination performed. A history of acne was less common in the patients than in matched controls. In addition, fewer patients had received treatment prescribed by a medical practitioner for their acne than had the controls. Examination revealed fewer patients with acne. These results suggest a reduced incidence of acne or its more severe forms in patients who have developed lymphomas and leukemias, and provide some support for the hypothesis that increased exposure or response to P. acnes, as appears to occur with acne, could confer protection against malignant disease.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in children with acute leukaemia. The present study was conducted to assess the prevalence of MDR bacteria in stool cultures of patients with acute leukaemia at presentation to the hospital. The results were then correlated with blood cultures when patients developed septicaemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved analysis of case records of patients with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia less than 18 years of age treated at our centre from January 2015 to December 2015. Stool cultures were sent within 72 hr of hospital admission and blood cultures were sent when clinically indicated. MDR was defined as resistance to at least one antibiotic in three or more following antimicrobial groups: cephalosporins, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. RESULTS: The analysis included 85 patients with acute leukaemia, among whom 48 of 85 (56%) patients had positive stool cultures and 42 of 85 (50%) patients were positive for MDR bacteria. Blood cultures were positive in 13 of 48 patients (27%, seven MDR and six non-MDR) with positive stool cultures and three of 37 patients (8%, one MDR and two non-MDR) with negative stool cultures (P = 0.01). The concordance between stool and blood culture for similar organism was 61%. There were seven deaths in 48 stool culture positive patients and two deaths in 37 stool culture negative patients. CONCLUSION: This study shows the high prevalence of MDR bacteria in newly diagnosed children with acute leukaemia. Colonisation with MDR bacteria in stools is associated with increased positivity of blood cultures and mortality.\n",
      "Chromosomal aberrations and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes are frequent in acute leukaemia. To determine whether the FHIT gene is involved in the development of leukaemia, we examined the FHIT transcript in 65 leukaemia cell lines, 5 fresh acute leukaemia patients at diagnosis and in complete remission, normal peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 14 healthy volunteers and Epstein-Barr (EB) virus transformed 5 B-cell lines (EB-lines), using nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. The transcripts were classified into 4 patterns: pattern I revealed the normal transcripts only, pattern II the altered transcripts in addition to the normal transcripts, pattern III the altered transcripts without the normal transcripts and pattern IV an absence of normal and altered FHIT transcripts. Nineteen cell lines were classified as pattern I, 32 as pattern II, 2 as pattern III and 12 as pattern IV. The frequency of loss of FHIT expression (pattern III or IV) varied in each type of leukaemia cell line; the order ranked from the highest incidence was acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), B-precursor ALL, B-ALL, and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). No genomic rearrangement was found in any samples examined. All of 5 patients showed same pattern II FHIT transcripts at 2 different stages of the disease. All normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and EB-lines were classified as pattern I or II. Our results suggested that patterns III and IV of FHIT transcripts might be associated with the development of a subset of leukaemia, while pattern II which has so far been reported as an aberrant transcript in varieties of malignant tumours might not be associated with leukaemogenesis.\n",
      "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) play a coordinated role during neoplastic invasion and proliferation. VEGF and MMPs expression was investigated in canine leukaemias by immunocytochemistry (MMP-9, MMP-2, VEGF-A) and quantitative RT-PCR (MMP-2, MMP-9, MT1-MMP, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, RECK, VEGF-A, VEGF-164). Blood samples were obtained from dogs with acute leukaemia (AL; n = 11) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL; n = 12). Levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1 and VEGF-A were higher in CLL than AL and controls. Expression of TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP mRNA was significantly higher in AL than CLL. Significant positive correlations were found between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and between MMP-9 and VEGF-A in CLL. These results suggest a potential role of MMP-9, MT1-MMP, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and VEGF in tissue migration and angiogenesis in canine leukaemia.\n",
      "A number of experimental studies have shown that natural killer (NK) cells can eliminate cancer cells and the mechanisms involved in this effect have been uncovered during the last two decades. Clinical data from haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) revealed that NK cells were responsible for remarkably favourable effects in both adult and paediatric high-risk leukaemias. NK receptors specific for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, including killer immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (KIR) and CD94/NKG2A, play a major role in the anti-leukaemia effect (mediating either inhibitory or activating signals). Haplo- HSCT requires a heavy conditioning regimen for the patient and the use of large numbers of T cell-depleted HSC to be grafted. After transplantation, natural killer cells develop from HSC shortly after engraftment and may include 'alloreactive' NK cells that kill leukaemic cells and prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Alloreactive NK cells are characterized by the expression of KIR that are not engaged by any of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles expressed by the patient. Their generation is dependent upon the existence of a KIR/HLA class I mismatch between donor and recipient. Novel important information on the function and specificity of different KIR has been obtained recently by the analysis of donor-derived alloreactive NK cells in a cohort of paediatric patients given haplo-HSCT to cure acute, high-risk leukaemias.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS), the most common syndromic chromosomal abnormality is associated with a unique susceptibility to develop both acute myeloid (ML) and lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). These leukaemias differ from the non-DS-related types of leukaemia and are thought to be distinct biological entities. AIMS: To perform a retrospective review of our experience of treating DS-related leukaemia at Our Lady Children Hospital. METHODS: Data were extracted from a database established in 2000 to prospectively gather data on DS-associated leukaemias and their outcomes following polychemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with DS-ML were treated and 19 with DS-ALL. Sixteen (84%) patients with DS-ML are alive and in complete remission with a median follow-up of 7 years. All deaths in this cohort were due to treatment-related mortality (TRM). Of the DS-ALL patients, 12 (63%) remain alive with a median follow-up of 3.6 years. TRM accounted for five of the six deaths. One death was due to leukaemic relapse. CONCLUSION: High cure rates are seen in DS-ML using contemporary polychemotherapy protocols, however, there is significant TRM in this cohort. DS-ALL does not have the same high cure rate as non-DS-ALL (>90%) and again this is mainly due to an excess of TRM.\n",
      "The Gardner report, recently published in the UK, showing a correlation between incidence of childhood leukaemia and paternal exposure to ionising radiations (amongst fathers working in nuclear power plants) has added a new element to debates about both the risk factors in nuclear power plants and the relationships between ionising radiations and leukaemogenesis. The epidemiologic and genetic evidence concerning leukaemias is reviewed here and it is concluded that the leukaemogenic agent, whose existence is indicated in the Gardner report, is unlikely to be paternal radiation dose per se but rather exposure to another factor that is correlated with parternal radiation dose received.\n",
      "Reimplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue (OT) can successfully restore ovarian function in young cancer patients after gonadotoxic treatment. However, for patients with leukaemia, there is a risk of malignant cell transmission. Our objective was to evaluate minimal disseminated disease in OT from leukaemia patients and test a follicle isolation technique to obtain disease-free follicle suspensions. Cryopreserved OT from 12 leukaemia patients was thawed and analysed by histology and long-term xenografting in immunosuppressed mice. In 10 patients, follicles were isolated from OT, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on tissue, digested ovarian suspensions and isolated follicle suspensions to investigate leukaemic cell presence. Mean patient age was 17·1 years. An average of 3·2 follicles were isolated per mm² of cortex. Xenografting of OT induced leukaemic masses in 2/12 mice. PCR identified leukaemic cell presence in 66% of OT. Malignant cells were also detected in digested ovarian suspensions. However, none of the follicle samples (>2300 follicles tested) showed any malignant cell presence after washing. This study demonstrates that it is possible to recover large numbers of viable follicles from cryopreserved OT of leukaemia patients. All isolated and washed follicle suspensions tested negative for leukaemic cells, giving leukaemia patients genuine hope of fertility restoration.\n",
      "The World Health Organization 2008 Classification emphasizes myeloperoxidase (MPO) detection as sufficient for assigning a blast population to the myeloid lineage. Published MPO positivity thresholds are 10% for flow cytometry (FCM) but 3% for cytochemistry. Here we re-evaluated the FCM-MPO threshold by comparing retrospectively 128 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias and 75 acute myeloid leukaemias without maturation, all assessed by benzidine-based cytochemistry. A 13% threshold was found to be relevant using an isotype control as background-reference (sensitivity 95·1%, specificity 91·7%). Residual normal lymphocytes proved to be an advantageous alternative reference, a threshold of 28% yielding improved 97·4% sensitivity and 96·1% specificity.\n",
      "To determine if mutations of the Wilms' tumor predisposing gene (WT1) are associated with haematological malignancies, we have investigated 65 cases of acute leukaemia, including 39 patients in blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), by amplification of WT1 exons 7, 8 and 9 followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. WT1 transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in all samples. An exon 7 silent polymorphism (A-->G; Arg 313) was identified in 17 individuals, 5 of whom were homozygous, but no other lesions were found. In 1 sample from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia a smaller size transcript missing exon 9 was detected; a similar abnormality has been described previously in a patient with Wilms' tumour and the resultant protein shown to act in a dominant-negative manner. No mutations of the exon 9 donor or acceptor splice sites were found in this patient and the basis of the abnormal transcript remains obscure. We conclude that dominant-negative mutations of the zinc finger region of the WT1 gene are uncommon in CML blast crisis. Abnormalities of this gene may, however, contribute to a small proportion of cases of de novo acute leukaemia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Mortality related to induction chemotherapy during the treatment of acute leukaemias (AL) has been estimated at 5-20%, and this increases with age. Fungal infection remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality and is considered an obstacle to the successful management of acute leukaemias. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all patients treated for acute leukaemias at a single institution between July 2006 and January 2009, to assess the impact of early antifungal therapy on outcome during induction chemotherapy. There were 44 episodes of induction chemotherapy, with a median age of patients of 61 years (range 18-81), including 29 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, 9 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 6 with relapsed AL. The median age was 61 years (range 18-81), and 20 patients were over the age of 60 years. RESULTS: All patients who developed febrile neutropenia received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Early empirical antifungal treatment was commenced with voriconazole (15 patients) or caspofungin (12 patients) if the febrile neutropenia did not resolve after 72 h of antibiotic therapy, in conjunction with radiological changes consistent with possible fungal infection. None of the patients succumbed during induction chemotherapy. The 120-day mortality rate after the induction therapy was 2.2%, without any incidence of invasive fungal disease. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that early empirical treatment for fungal infection with voriconazole or caspofungin is associated with a favourable outcome of induction therapy for acute leukaemias. Further studies to confirm this finding are warranted.\n",
      "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have drawn much attention amongst stem cell researchers in the past few decades. The ability of the MSC to differentiate into cells of mesodermal and non-mesodermal origins has made them an attractive approach for cell-based therapy and regenerative medicine. The MSCs have immunosuppressive activities that may have considerable therapeutic values in autoimmune diseases. However, despite the many beneficial effects reported, there is a growing body of evidence, which suggests that MSCs could be a culprit of enhanced tumour growth, metastasis and drug resistance in leukaemia, via some modulatory effects. Many controversies regarding the interactions between MSCs and leukaemia still exist. Furthermore, the role of MSCs in leukemogenesis and its progression remain largely unknown. Hence it is important to understand how the MSCs modulate leukaemia before these cells could be safely used in the treatment of leukaemia patients.\n",
      "Recent advances have highlighted extensive phenotypic and functional similarities between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells. This raises the question of whether disease therapies can be developed that eliminate cancer stem cells without eliminating normal stem cells. Here we address this issue by conditionally deleting the Pten tumour suppressor gene in adult haematopoietic cells. This led to myeloproliferative disease within days and transplantable leukaemias within weeks. Pten deletion also promoted haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation. However, this led to HSC depletion via a cell-autonomous mechanism, preventing these cells from stably reconstituting irradiated mice. In contrast to leukaemia-initiating cells, HSCs were therefore unable to maintain themselves without Pten. These effects were mostly mediated by mTOR as they were inhibited by rapamycin. Rapamycin not only depleted leukaemia-initiating cells but also restored normal HSC function. Mechanistic differences between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells can thus be targeted to deplete cancer stem cells without damaging normal stem cells.\n",
      "A finding of cytogenetic abnormalities, even when these are clonal and even when the abnormalities are typically associated with leukaemia, is not the same as a person having leukaemia. We describe a person who had acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and achieved a complete haematological remission and who then had persistent and transient clonal cytogenetic abnormalities for 22 years but no recurrence of leukaemia. These data suggest that clones of myeloid cells with mutations and capable of expanding to levels detectable by routine cytogenetic analyses do not all eventuate in leukaemia, even after a prolonged observation interval. The possibility of incorrectly diagnosing a person as having leukaemia becomes even greater when employing more sensitive techniques to detect mutations such as by polymerase chain reaction and whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing. Caution is needed when interpreting clonal abnormalities in AML patients with normal blood and bone marrow parameters.\n",
      "We present a unique case of an infant with acute monocytic leukaemia who presented at birth with multiple rubbery, erythematous to violaceous subcutaneous nodules secondary to leukaemia cutis. As these infiltrates regressed with chemotherapy, numerous white to yellow linear confluent papules appeared in a scratch-like pattern. These lesions were widely disseminated but were concentrated across her face, trunk and extremities with relative sparing of the napkin area and back. We propose that these lesions represent a form of dystrophic calcinosis cutis that occurred secondary to koebnerization in an infant with congenital leukaemia cutis.\n",
      "Rearrangements of the ALL-1/MLL1 gene underlie the majority of infant acute leukaemias, as well as of therapy-related leukaemias developing in cancer patients treated with inhibitors of topoisomerase II, such as VP16 and doxorubicin. The rearrangements fuse ALL-1 to any of >50 partner genes or to itself. Here, we describe the unique features of ALL-1-associated leukaemias, and recent progress in understanding molecular mechanisms involved in the activity of the ALL-1 protein and of its Drosophila homologue TRITHORAX.\n",
      "The present paper describes two new MoAbs, GHI/75 and VMP55, which were raised against a glycoprotein enriched lysate of hairy cell leukaemia. These antibodies recognized a new antigen of 72 kD (unreduced) and 83 kD (reduced) molecular weight. GHI/75 and VMP55 gave very strong staining of plasma cells, moderate labelling of circulating B cells but only weak staining of monocytes, some tissue macrophages and lymphoid cells. Neither antibody reacted with neutrophils or any non-haematopoietic cells. Both antibodies, however, strongly labelled the tumour cells in hairy cell leukaemia, multiple myeloma, plasmacytoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas. No staining was seen of the neoplastic cells in Hodgkin disease, myeloid leukaemia or T cell lymphomas. The two antibodies, GHI/75 and VMP55, may be of value in the differential diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemias and plasma cell neoplasms. In addition, the ease with which their antigen can be purified provides the possibility for a detailed study of this molecule.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between the risk of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and proximity of residence to nuclear installations in England and Wales. DESIGN: Observed and expected numbers of cases were calculated and analysed by standard methods based on ratios of observed to expected counts and by a new statistical test, the linear risk score test, based on ranks and designed to be sensitive to excess incidence in close proximity to a putative source of risk. SETTING: Electoral wards within 25 km of 23 nuclear installations and six control sites that had been investigated for suitability for generating stations but never used. SUBJECTS: Children below age 15 in England and Wales, 1966-87. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Registration of any leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. RESULTS: In none of the 25 km circles around the installations was the incidence ratio significantly greater than 1.0. The only significant results for the linear risk score test were for Sellafield (P = 0.00002) and Burghfield (P = 0.031). The circles for Aldermaston and Burghfield overlap; the incidence ratio was 1.10 in each. One of the control sites gave a significant linear risk score test result (P = 0.020). All the tests carried out were one sided with P values estimated by simulation. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of a general increase of childhood leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma around nuclear installations. Apart from Sellafield, the evidence for distance related risk is very weak.\n",
      "Regulation of complement (C') dependent lysis of cells is attributed to certain membrane proteins. One of these is decay-accelerating factor (DAF), CD55, a 70kD glycosylated protein which functions to protect host cells from damage by autologous C'. We hypothesized that blockade of DAF function by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) could augment C'-dependent lysis mediated by another mAb to a cell surface antigen expressed on leukaemia cells. Thus, we tested the effects of the anti-DAF mAb 1C6 on the ability of both rabbit and human C' to lyse human leukaemia cells through activation by complement-fixing murine mAb. DAF antigen was highly expressed on most leukaemia cell lines and primary acute leukaemia blast cells tested. Murine mAb to CD15 (PM-81) and to gp 120 (AML-1-99), both IgM, also bound to the majority of myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia cells. Using human serum as a source of C', the addition of mAb 1C6 reduced by an additional 85-94% the numbers of clonogenic HL-60 (myeloid leukaemia) cells lysed by mAb PM-81 alone. Similarly, the addition of mAb 1C6 reduced by an additional 87% the numbers of HL-60 colonies eliminated by mAb AML-1-99 alone. Similar results were observed in an experimental purging model using the myeloid leukaemia cell lines HL-60, U937 or NB4 cells as targets. These results show that mAb 1C6 can effectively block the actions of DAF. In the presence of mAb 1C6, the cytotoxic activity mediated by human C' was similar to that of rabbit C'. These results show that increased tumour cell killing can be achieved through DAF blockade. This finding has relevance to clinical trials using C'-fixing mAb for purging bone marrow of occult tumour cells prior to autologous transplantation.\n",
      "Many studies suggest that killing of tumour cell by commonly used therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy) is mediated primarily by induction of apoptosis. Therefore, resistance of tumour cells to therapy can be caused by a failure in the ability to initiate apoptosis. Defects in apoptosis signalling pathways are also one of the main features of cancer, and particularly acute leukaemia. Malignant cells constantly resist the effects of cellular stress (e.g. DNA damage, oncogene activation), which would cause death of normal cells through apoptosis. Dysregulation of apoptosis has therefore give rise to tumour growth, disease progression and resistance of malignant cells to chemotherapy. Structural analysis of Bcl-2 family proteins playing a key role in regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis together with studies of their biochemical functions have outlines strategies for generation of drugs, resulting in numerous novel chemical entities with potential to reverse resistance of malignant cells to apoptosis. The use of these therapeutic approaches may in the future represent a new way in cancer therapy with high potential to improve clinical outcome and prognosis of acute leukaemia patients.\n",
      "Acute leukemia, defined as a genetic disease, is the most common cancer in children representing about one half of all cancers among persons younger than 15 years. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) each represents a heterogeneous complex of disorders, with genetic abnormalities presenting in more than 80% of ALLs and more than 90% of AMLs. The diagnostic gold standard and classification of leukaemia involves various methods including morphology, cytochemistry, cytogenetics and molecular genetics, immunophenotyping, and molecular biology. These diagnostic methods are a prerequisite for individual treatment strategies and for the evaluation of treatment response especially considering that many distinct types of acute leukemia are known to carry predictable prognoses and warrant specific therapy. The quantification of gene expression is essential in determination of tailored therapeutic decisions. Microarray technology offers the possibility of quantifying thousands of genes in a single analysis, thus potentially becoming an essential tool for molecular classification to be used in routine leukaemia diagnostics. MLL+ leukaemia is a perfect example as to the exact correspondence between gene expression and protein expression evaluated by flow cytometry. Applying computational analysis to flow cytometry results, it is possible to distinguish the MLL+ acute leukemia from MLL- acute leukemia using as the top ranked antigen some top ranked genes described in the Microarray evaluation. Key markers discriminating different leukemia phenotypes can be identified by univariate hypothesis testing from a data set of immunophenotypic markers described by two variables, one reflecting the intensity of expression (MESF) and the other the pattern of distribution (CV). A current multi center study called Microarray Innovations in Leukemia (MILE Study) uses higher density gene chips providing nearly complete coverage of the human genome. The study which has analyzed thus far 1837 retrospective cases shows that each important leukemia subtype has a specific genetic fingerprint, meaning that different combinations of genes whose expression is linked to each subtype can be identified allowing for patient tailored therapy. Moreover, the study has achieved 97% diagnostic accuracy on samples from tested patients. Statistical analysis has shown a high concordance level between standard diagnostic procedures and those of the microarray technology--globally around 95.6%. Additionally it is possible to correctly classify some subgroups incorrectly identified using gold standard methods. Thus, from a technical viewpoint, gene expression profiling in tandem with flow cytometry should be a viable alternative to standard diagnostic approaches. Whether gene expression profiling will become a practical diagnostic alternative remains to be seen.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study is to explore the recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of leukaemias with a translocation involving the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene and therapeutic implications of these discoveries. RECENT FINDINGS: The pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged leukaemias has recently been elucidated in a flurry of clinical studies that have appeared over the past 5 years. On the basis of these studies, a phase 1 clinical trial has been initiated targeting the histone methyltransferase DOT1L with interim clinical results reported at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2014. SUMMARY: Acute leukaemia, both myeloid and lymphoid, that harbours a translocation involving the MLL gene at chromosome locus 11q23 has a poor prognosis, even with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The pathogenesis of MLL translocated leukaemias has recently been linked to aberrant activity of the histone methyltransferase DOT1. Preclinical studies of DOT1L inhibition with potent, selective inhibitors have shown successful eradication of the leukaemic clone in animal models. On the basis of these studies, a phase 1, first in man, clinical trial has been initiated with a DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ-5676.\n",
      "The core idea of the proposed thermodynamic modelling of malignancy in leukaemia is entropy arising within normal haematopoiesis. Mathematically its description is supposed to be similar to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations for simplified processes of heat flow in fluids. The hypothetical model provides a description of remission and relapse in leukaemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal haematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and the spontaneous remission of leukaemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of haematopoiesis to an increase in entropy caused by leukaemia clones. The following predictions are formulated: a) the percentage of leukaemia cells in marrow as a criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but is a variable value; b) the probability of remission depends upon normal haematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) the duration of remission depends upon the eradication of leukaemia cells through induction or consolidation therapies; d) excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation may induce relapse.\n",
      "Our objective was to investigate the association of childhood leukaemia with selected maternal and birth characteristics by conducting a population-based case-control study using linked cancer registry and birth certificate records for Washington State. We compared maternal and infant characteristics of 595 Washington-born residents <20 years old with leukaemia diagnosed during 1981-2003, and 5,950 control children, using stratified analysis and logistic regression. Maternal age 35+ years (odds ratio [OR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1, 2.0), infant birthweight 4,000+ g (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 1.8), neonatal jaundice (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.1, 2.1), and Down syndrome (OR 31.3; 95% CI 6.4, 153.4) were associated with an increased risk of leukaemia. Among women with 2+ pregnancies, having at least two prior early (<20 weeks' gestation) fetal deaths was also associated with an increased risk (OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.97, 2.1). Maternal unmarried status (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6, 0.9) and African American race (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3, 0.9) were associated with a decreased risk. These results were more marked for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) than for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and for leukaemia diagnosed <5 years of age. These results may provide clues to the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. Genetic epidemiological studies are needed to expand our knowledge of inherent and possibly prenatal influences on the occurrence of this disease.\n",
      "Twenty patients with leukaemia received recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in a double blind controlled trial, with a significant promotion of granulopoiesis when compared with 20 control patients. The follow-up in survivors is now sufficiently long to assess the potential for promotion of relapse in the patients with myeloid leukaemias. Six patients with myeloid leukaemias are alive 22-38 months after transplantation. Eight other patients with myeloid leukaemias died within 12 weeks of transplantation without active active disease. None of these 14 patients with myeloid leukaemias have relapsed. This study supports the view that rhGM-CSF does not increase the probability of relapse after allogeneic BMT in patients with myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "The most striking and consistent trend in leukaemia in different countries since 1950 is the recent decline in mortality in childhood, reflecting the advent of effective methods of treatment in the 1960s. Increases at ages 75-84 in several countries since 1950 are consistent with improvements in cancer registration and in the detail of death certification. However, in the main, these have not persisted into the 1980s. Otherwise, there has been no obvious international pattern, and partly for this reason, the rates have been presented in some detail so that readers can make their own judgment.\n",
      "Terminal transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) comparable to the blast-cell transformation which is responsible for almost all deaths in the chronic myeloid leukaemias is a rare event because the majority of CLL patients die without a major or easily recognised morphological transformation of the leukaemia cells having occurred. However, a substantial proportion of these patients die with progressive treatment-resistant disease or from intractable infections resulting from CLL-related immunodeficiency. In many of these patients biological transformation of the leukaemia cells can be associated with the appearance of complex chromosomal changes not present earlier or additional to the commonly present trisomy 12(1). In a broad sense, therefore, all of these patients may be said to undergo lethal transformation of their disease in contrast to the, admittedly substantial numbers, especially of elderly males who die from causes totally unrelated to their CLL, especially cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and other malignant diseases. In the narrow sense the term 'terminal transformation' is usually restricted to those conditions in which the terminal event is the proliferation of a new population of lymphoid cells of enhanced malignancy. There are three well-known types of transformation. One, 'prolymphrocytoid' transformation is relatively low-grade, while the other two, 'Richter syndrome' and 'immunoblastic transformation' are rapidly progressive conditions. The last two account for about 5% of all deaths in CLL, but the slowly progressive prolymphocytoid transformation has been described too recently to permit reliable estimates of its frequency in unselected series to CLL. It may be of the order of 10%.\n",
      "The graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect following allogeneic stem cell transplantation is clear evidence that T lymphocytes can control and eliminate myeloid leukaemias. The successful identification of a range of leukaemia specific antigens (LSA) in recent years has stimulated efforts to induce leukaemia specific T cell responses to these antigens with peptide vaccines. An ideal LSA should be restricted in its expression to leukaemia including progenitor cells, intrinsically connected with the leukaemic phenotype, and capable of inducing strong cytotoxic T cell responses to the leukaemia. Peptides from three well-characterized LSA, the breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) fusion protein of chronic myelogenous leukaemia, proteinase-3 and Wilms tumour 1 protein, serve as the basis for several clinical trials using peptide and adjuvants to treat patients with a variety of myeloid malignancies. Preliminary results from these studies indicate that these peptides induce immune responses which can translate into clinical responses which include complete remissions from leukaemia. These promising early results point the way to optimizing the administration of peptide vaccines and suggest ways of combining vaccination with allogeneic stem cell transplantation to boost GVL effects.\n",
      "In vivo tissue characterization by measurement of T1- and T2-relaxation processes is one of the greatest potentials of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This may be especially useful in the evaluation of bone marrow disorders as the MRI-signal from bone marrow is not influenced by the overlying osseous tissue. Nine patients with acute leukaemia, one patient with myelodysplastic syndrome, and ten normal volunteers were included in the study. The T1- and T2-relaxation processes were measured in the lumbar spine bone marrow using a wholebody superconductive MR-scanner operating at 1.5 Tesla. In the patients MRI was done at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up of chemotherapy and related to bone marrow biopsies taken within three days of the MRI. At the time of diagnosis T1-relaxation time was increased two to three times in the patients (range 0.7-3.0 sec.) compared to the controls (range 0.38-0.60 sec.). No significant difference was seen in the T2-relaxation process. In relation to chemotherapy T1 decreased towards the normal range in the patients who obtained complete remission, whereas T1 remained prolonged in the patients who did not respond successfully to the treatment. The results indicate that MRI may be a non-invasive clinically useful tool in the evaluation of acute leukaemia especially as a follow-up control of chemotherapy.\n",
      "We describe the results of treatment with 2'-deoxycoformycin (DCF) in 68 patients with post-thymic (mature) T-cell malignancies. These included: prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), 31, HTLV-1 + adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL), 20, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), comprising mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, 13, and large granular lymphocytic leukaemia, four. Two-thirds of patients were refractory to previous therapy, which included four drug combinations. DCF was given intravenously at 4 mg m-2 weekly for the first 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks until maximal response. Toxicity was very low with only one death resulting from prolonged neutropenia. Overall response rates, partial (PR) and complete. (CR), were 38%, with variations according to diagnosis. Best responses, 54%, were seen in CTCL but limited to Sezary patients, one CR, six PR, whilst none of the mycosis fungoides responded. Responses in T-PLL were recorded in 48% including three CR (of 8-12 months' duration unmaintained) and 12 PR. Fifteen per cent of responses were seen in ATLL. The only ATLL responders - two CR, one PR - were those patients who received combination chemotherapy prior to DCF, with reduction of tumour bulk but short of PR. When results were analysed according to membrane phenotypes it was apparent that responses were seen mainly in cases with CD4+, CD8- T cells -22 of 47 (47%) - contrasting with only three of 19 (16%) with other T-cell phenotypes. We conclude that DCF is a useful therapy for the treatment of T-cell leukaemias, in particular Sezary syndrome and T-PLL, and should play a part in strategies to improve the natural history of this group of lymphoid malignancies.\n",
      "Progress in the management and understanding of acute leukaemia can only be obtained if these diseases are thoroughly investigated, both clinically and with a series of biological tools. This alone has made and still will make possible the identification of prognostic factors and of useful markers for the follow-up of patients in remission. Among the variety of approaches of acute leukaemia definition, immunophenotyping has taken over the past 25 years a predominant and now well-defined place, although room is left for further improvement. In this review, the current state-of-the-art of immunophenotyping of acute leukaemias will be replaced in the context of physiological leukocyte maturation. The recognized classifications and recommended immunophenotyping panels will then be discussed, and the clinical relevance of several key features will be presented. Finally, more recent openings for the use of immunophenotyping will be evoked.\n",
      "We describe a unique case of hybrid leukaemia with bilineal and biphenotypic features. The coexistence of lymphoblasts and monoblasts was determined morphologically and cytochemically. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that each blast population had both T lymphoid (CD2, cytoplasmic CD3) and myeloid (CD11, CD13, CD15) markers. Southern blot analysis of DNA extracted from the lymph node biopsy demonstrated the presence of monoclonal rearrangement of the TcR-C beta gene. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow cells showed a karyotype of 48, XY, 7q+ in all of the metaphases examined. These observations are suggestive of a monoclonal origin for these two distinct blast populations.\n",
      "An intrauterine origin of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was proven by the identical clonotypic gene rearrangement in the concordant leukaemias of monozygotic twins, arising from a single clonogenic progeny. The monozygotic twins, presented at the age of 22 months with acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AML-M7) in one and myelodysplasia transformed to AML-M7 in the other. Leukaemic cells in both twins carried trisomy 21 and additional different clonal evolution changes of del(20q) in the first twin and trisomy 8 in the second. AML-M7 of late infancy with trisomy 21 may be included in the leukaemias of intrauterine origin, possibly a result of genotoxic insult.\n",
      "The dLNGFR is a cytoplasmically deleted form of the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (LNGFR, also known as p75NTR). Recently, we observed a myeloid leukaemia in mice transplanted with dLNGFR-modified bone marrow cells. Retroviral-mediated expression of dLNGFR was suspected to contribute to the murine leukaemia. This led us to investigate the expression of p75NTR in human leukaemia. Expression of p75NTR was observed in nine of 119 (8%) adult patients with acute leukaemia by flow cytometry analysis, particularly in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (26%). These results support further detailed analyses of neurotrophin receptors and downstream signalling pathways in haematological malignancies.\n",
      "BMT has gained its place in the treatment of childhood leukaemia. Nevertheless, there are still many questions open. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia children should normally be grafted in 2nd remission (CR). Some high risk cases, however, should probably be grafted in 1st CR. It is not clear whether children with late relapses benefit more from BMT than from renewed chemotherapy. Children with a relapse during maintenance therapy, however, have a better survival rate with BMT. In acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia certain high risk patients should be grafted in 1st CR but it has still to be shown that BMT is superior to chemotherapy in such cases. It is not clear whether children with a relapse following intensive chemotherapy (such as the BFM-protocols) will benefit from BMT at all. In chronic myelocytic leukaemia, BMT in chronic phase should be performed. Thus, for the first time cure has become possible for this disease. Waiting for acceleration or even the occurrence of a blast crisis decreases the chance of survival after BMT dramatically. Since complications of BMT such as graft-versus-host reaction or severe infections are less frequent in children, relapses remain the main problem after BMT in childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "In children with acute leukaemia, measurements of minimal residual disease (MRD) provide unique information on treatment response and have become a crucial component of contemporary treatment protocols. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the most useful MRD assays are based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of antigen-receptor genes, and on flow cytometric detection of abnormal immunophenotypes. The latter is the only MRD assay available for most patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). PCR amplification of chromosomal breakpoints and fusion transcripts can also be used to track MRD in a minority of patients with ALL or AML. Because of the strong correlation between MRD levels and risk of relapse, several ongoing regimens include treatment intensification for children with higher MRD. Treatment de-intensification for patients with early MRD clearance is also being tested. In addition to their direct clinical application, MRD measurements can be used to better understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of drug resistance in vivo. The identification of new markers of leukaemia and the use of increasingly sophisticated technologies for detection of rare cells should further facilitate routine monitoring of MRD and elucidate the features of drug-resistant leukaemic cells.\n",
      "In this study we investigated the presence of structural lesions in the ALL-1, p53 and p16 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor) genes in leukaemic cells obtained from 22 patients with infant acute leukaemia (aged < 18 months). Of these, 18 cases were classified as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and four as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Tumour DNAs were analysed by a combination of Southern blot. polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and direct sequence analyses. The results showed ALL-1 gene rearrangements in 15/22 (68%) cases, p53 gene mutations in 5/22 (26%), and a homozygous deletion of p16 in a single T-ALL case. p53 and p16 alterations were all found in the group of patients with ALL-1 gene rearrangements. p53 mutations were more often associated with a myeloid phenotype (3/5). In summary, multiple molecular alterations were found in 6/15 (40%) infant acute leukaemias with ALL-1 rearrangements. As to the clinical course, patients with additional lesions had similar clinical outcome with respect to patients with ALL-1 gene rearrangement as the sole genetic aberration. This may support the hypothesis that ALL-1 alterations are genetic events per se sufficient to confer a fully malignant phenotype to the leukaemic clone.\n",
      "The effect of recombinant interleukin 2 (IL2) on the in vitro and in vivo proliferation and growth of human acute leukaemia cells of both myeloid and lymphoid origin was investigated. In none of the 25 primary samples tested could a continuously in vitro growing cell line be obtained by adding IL2 to the culture medium. Although IL2 induced a proliferative signal in three of the 31 acute leukaemias analysed, the overall 3H-thymidine uptake of the neoplastic cells was significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) in the presence of IL2. The unlikelihood of an important proliferative signal triggered by IL2 was confirmed in a semisolid clonogenic assay, which failed to document an increased colony growth in the 26 samples studied. Furthermore, using a colorimetric assay as a test for cell proliferation and survival, in seven of the 11 fresh acute leukaemia samples tested a 22-40% reduction in viability was observed in the presence of IL2, while in the remaining four, IL2 was ineffective. In order to investigate the effect of IL2 in an in vivo setting, an experimental model in heavily immunosuppressed nu/nu mice was established. In no case did IL2 promote the in vivo proliferation and growth of human myeloid and lymphoid acute leukaemia cells injected in the mice. On the contrary, with seven of the eight leukaemic cell lines which gave rise spontaneously to leukaemic masses, this could be prevented when the mice received locally 300 U of IL2 three times daily for 90 d. IL2 also blocked the growth in vivo of three fresh acute leukaemia samples (two myeloid and one lymphoid). Co-culture experiments using leukaemic cell lines and increasing numbers of normal lymphocytes suggest that the inhibitory effect of IL2 is probably exerted via an indirect mechanism. These findings, coupled to the well-documented ability of IL2 to generate lymphokine activated killer cells cytolytic against leukaemic blasts, further point to the potential role of immunotherapy with IL2 in the management of patients with haematological malignancies.\n",
      "Our objective was to investigate whether exposure to residential power-frequency (50 Hz) magnetic fields above 0.2 microT increases a child risk of leukaemia and to confirm or reject a finding from a previous German study on this topic, which reported increased leukaemia risk with exposure to stronger magnetic fields during the night. A population-based case-control study was used, covering the whole of the former West Germany. Residential magnetic fields were measured over 24 hr for 514 children with acute leukaemia identified by the German Childhood Cancer Registry and 1,301 control children taken from population registration files. Magnetic fields above 0.2 microT were relatively rare in Germany (only 1.5% of the study population). Childhood leukaemia and 24 hr median magnetic fields were only weakly related (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 0.65-3.67). A significant association was seen between childhood leukaemia and magnetic field exposure during the night (OR = 3.21, 95% CI 1.33-7.80). A dose-response-relationship was observed after combining the data of all German studies on magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia. The evidence for an association between childhood leukaemia and magnetic field exposure in our study comes from a measure of exposure during the night. Despite the large size of our study, the results are based on small numbers of exposed children. If the observed association stands, the effect on a population level in Germany would be small.\n",
      "The expression of the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), recently identified as cytokine-inducible ligand of the beta 1-integrin VLA-4, was investigated on normal and malignant haemopoietic precursors as well as on haemopoietic cell lines. VCAM-1 was demonstrated on > 20% blasts in 4/22 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 6/10 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) specimens but was absent from CD34+ normal bone marrow precursor cells. Interestingly, the VCAM-1+ AMLs classified as M1 and M5 simultaneously expressed N-CAM (CD56), a member of the immunoglobulin family. In ALL, VCAM-1 expression was restricted to Calla+ CD19+ precursors of the c-ALL subtype. VCAM-1 was also found on some cell lines, mainly of the B-lymphocytic type. Furthermore, in 13/20 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) samples > 20% of the CD19+ B-lymphocytic precursors carried VCAM-1, which seemed to correlate with more advanced disease. Therefore VCAM-1 expression appeared to characterize leukaemic cells of the B-cell lineage as well as a CD56+ subset of AML. Since its expression was clinically correlated with dermal infiltrates of leukaemic cells in AML and with advanced Rai stages in CLL, VCAM-1 may play a role in enhanced adhesion of the malignant cells to tissues and/or to each other.\n",
      "AIMS: In the absence of adequate aspirate films and touch imprints, distinction of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) from acute myeloid leukaemia with monocytic differentiation (Mo-AML) may be difficult solely on the basis of bone marrow biopsy morphological features. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a novel immunohistochemical panel for the diagnosis of acute and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemias in bone marrow biopsies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical labelling for CD14, CD123, CD33, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD68R was assessed in 49 myeloid neoplasms with monocytic differentiation (24 CMMLs and 25 Mo-AMLs) and compared with that of 15 non-monocytic acute myeloid leukaemias (NM-AMLs) and 17 non-neoplastic controls. More than 20% CD14 immunohistochemistry (IHC)+ cells were seen only in Mo-AMLs and CMMLs, although Mo-AMLs showed wide variability and overlapped with other categories. More than 20% CD68R IHC+ cells had the highest sensitivity and specificity for Mo-AML. Discrepant MPO-/CD33+ expression was specific for Mo-AML but insensitive. A subset of blasts in Mo-AMLs and NM-AMLs were weakly CD123+. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly increased number of CD14+ cells raises the possibility of a myelomonocytic neoplasm but does not distinguish between CMML and Mo-AML. Significantly increased numbers of CD68R IHC+ cells and a discrepant MPO-/CD33+ staining pattern are specific for Mo-AML but are best utilized in a comprehensive panel.\n",
      "The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is described for both children and adults for the three major immunophenotypes: null, CD10-positive (CD+) which includes both common and pre-B types, and T-cell (including pre-T variants). The data are derived from a population-based specialist registry of leukaemias and lymphomas covering approximately one-half of England and Wales. Null ALL predominates in those under 1 year old and CD10+ ALL in the 1-7 year olds. There is a male excess at all ages for T-cell disease, which is particularly prominent in adolescents and young adults. The effect of socioeconomic levels is seen most clearly for CD10+ ALL in the childhood peak, where B-cell precursor disease occurs more frequently in areas of higher socioeconomic status.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of lymphoid malignancy in Western countries, accounting for around a quarter of all leukaemias. Evidence from epidemiological and family studies have provided evidence for familial clustering of CLL compatible with inherited genetic predisposition to CLL. Direct evidence for genetic susceptibility has been provided by a recent genome wide association study of CLL which has identified common variants at 10 different loci which influence CLL risk. Here we review the current knowledge regarding the allelic architecture of susceptibility to CLL and what the currently identified risk loci are telling us regarding disease aetiology.\n",
      "A total of 219 families of patients with cystic fibrosis living in Wales were studied for the occurrence of other diseases and for cause of death, and the findings in relation to leukaemia are reported. There were eight deaths due to leukaemia, five of the myeloid type, in first and second degree relatives; this is significantly more than the expected on the basis of national age specific mortality rates. In comparison, mortality among siblings, parents, aunts and uncles, and grandparents from all causes was within the expected. Screening the five patients with myeloid leukaemia for the delta F508 mutation showed that four were carriers of this mutation. It is concluded that carriers of the delta F508 mutation may have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia. This could happen through the direct effect of the cystic fibrosis gene itself, or through its influence on another gene, such as the met oncogene, or gene(s) involved in granulocyte function on the long arm of chromosome 7.\n",
      "The pattern of occurrence of malignant disorders in people with Down syndrome (DS) is unique and may serve as a model in the search for leukaemogenic genes and tumour suppressor genes on chromosome 21, since the risk of leukaemia is higher in individuals with DS than in non-DS individuals. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in DS shares many of the clinical characteristics of the same malignancy in other patients, and with current intensive therapy the long-term survival is similar. Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia have unique clinical characteristics in these patients and are best described as a single disorder, termed myeloid leukaemia of DS. When these patients are treated intensively, they show better survival rates than patients without DS. This may be related to increased expression of genes on chromosome 21 contributing to increased chemosensitivity. Chronic myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia occur less often than expected. With the exception of an increased risk of retinoblastoma, germ-cell tumours, and perhaps lymphomas, the risk of developing solid tumours is lower in both children and adults. Breast cancer is almost absent, and the risk of a second malignant disease after treatment for leukaemia also appears to be decreased. Increased susceptibility to apoptosis in DS may result in cell death rather than malignant transformation after major cell injuries. This hypothesis would explain the decreased risk of both solid tumours and secondary cancers.\n",
      "A population-based case-control interview study of 309 childhood leukaemia cases and 618 age and sex matched controls showed a significant dose-response relation between chloramphenicol and risk of both acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL), treatment for more than 10 days being associated with risks of 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. A significant risk of ANLL was also observed with the use of syntomycin, a drug pharmacologically related to chloramphenicol. The risks remained high when analyses were limited to either first or latest use of these antibiotics more than 2 years before diagnosis. Although the association may have non-causal explanations, the results warrant cautious prescribing patterns and further investigations into the leukaemogenic potential of chloramphenicol.\n",
      "The polymerase-chain reaction was applied for detection of provirus DNA of the bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). A short fragment of 292 bp including region R and U5 LTR 5' of BLV was amplified, and the optimum parameters of amplification of this fragment were established. Electrophoresis revealed the presence of the 292 bp fragment from the leucocytes of four out of six cows showing a positive serological response to BLV antigens. Application of the polymerase-chain reaction in diagnosis of bovine leukaemia is suggested.\n",
      "Increased risks for leukaemia and lymphoma have been suggested in studies of workers exposed to styrene in the rubber and plastics industry. A historical cohort study was conducted in Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom involving 40,683 workers employed in the reinforced plastics industry, where high exposure to styrene occurs. Exposure to styrene was reconstructed through job histories, environmental and biological monitoring data and production records of the plants in the study. Cause-specific national death rates were used as the reference. Among exposed workers, no excess was observed for mortality from all causes (2195 deaths, standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 91-99), from all neoplasms, from lung cancer or from other major epithelial cancers. Mortality from neoplasms of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues was not elevated (50 deaths; SMR, 96; CI, 71-126) and was not consistently associated with length of exposure. The rate of mortality from leukaemias and lymphomas increased with time since first exposure. Among subjects who had been exposed for more than one year, a two-fold risk was observed 20 years after first exposure (eight deaths; SMR, 197; CI, 85-387). These results are inadequate to exclude the possibility that styrene causes leukaemia and lymphoma.\n",
      "Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) affects the growth of human leukaemic cells by different modes of action depending on the type of leukaemia involved. We have analysed the structure of TNF receptors on cells from different types of leukaemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) either in chronic phase (CML-CP) or blastic crisis (CML-BC). The affinity crosslinking technique showed the existence of TNF receptors on cells from all the leukaemic cases studied with similar receptor structures. The TNF receptor showed a molecular weight of 76 kD when examined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In conclusion, we provide evidence for existence of TNF receptors on several types of human leukaemia cells with an apparent molecular weight of 76 kD. Apparently, the discrepancy of TNF actions on the leukaemic growth are not related to the structure of TNF receptors.\n",
      "Following a review of central leukaemia registration data for Scottish children 1968-1981 a retrospective assessment of leukaemia type was made by inspection of bone marrow slides. Only 57% of slides were still available and in 72% of these the review panel confirmed the initial diagnosis of leukaemia and its type. In eight cases the panel disagreed with the diagnosis or the type of leukaemia designated. Central slide review at diagnosis in childhood leukaemia is essential if subsequent epidemiological studies are to be meaningful.\n",
      "AIMS: To compare the sensitivity of the ultrastructural method to detect myeloperoxidase (MPO) with light microscopy and immunocytochemistry using an anti-MPO antibody; to examine the expression of lymphoid antigens in relation to MPO activity in blast cells from cases of biphenotypic leukaemia. METHODS: Blast cells from 14 cases of biphenotypic acute leukaemia were analysed. Immunological markers were performed by single or double immunofluorescence staining on a flow cytometer. The presence of MPO was determined by light microscopy, electron microscopy on fixed and unfixed cells, and by immunoalkaline phosphatase with an anti-MPO antibody. The immunogold method was applied at the ultrastructural level to assess the expression of lymphoid and myeloid antigens at the same time as the MPO activity. RESULTS: Six of the 14 cases were initially classified as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and eight as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). MPO activity was shown at the ultrastructural level in 4-99% blasts from all cases. Six of the 14 were MPO negative by light microscopy and three of these were negative with the antibody anti-MPO. Coexpression of lymphoid antigens (CD19, CD10, or CD2) and MPO was shown by the immunogold method in four out of 11 cases; in seven cases the blasts coexpressed myeloid antigens (CD13, CD33) and MPO. CONCLUSIONS: Electron microscopy is more sensitive for showing MPO than light microscopy and immunocytochemistry; the immunogold method combined with MPO used at the ultrastructural level can help to define the cell lineage involved in biphenotypic leukaemia by highlighting the myeloid component defined by MPO.\n",
      "SOCS1 and SHP1 are negative regulators of the Jak/STAT signalling pathway that is implicated in leukaemogenesis. We studied if aberrant methylation of SOCS1 and SHP1 might be involved in the pathogenesis and prognostication of acute leukaemias by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). At diagnosis, methylation of SHP1 occurred more frequently in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n=26, 52%) than acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n=6, 24%) (p=0.02). Methylation of SOCS1 was absent in both AML and ALL patients. SHP1 methylation was not associated with specific clinicopathologic features and had no prognostic impact on AML patients. Frequent methylation of SHP1, but not SOCS1, may be important in the pathogenesis, but not prognosis, of acute leukaemias.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent work has shown that the Musashi 2 (Msi2) gene plays important roles in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Here, we give an overview on the role of Msi2 in the regulation and function of primitive hematopoietic cells as well as in leukaemic progression. We also discuss the molecular pathways in which Msi2 acts in both normal and leukaemic blood cells. RECENT FINDINGS: Msi2 gain and loss of function experiments have shown that it plays an important role in regulating the heamatopoietic stem cell pool. Msi2 has also been found to be overexpressed in human myeloid leukaemias correlating with poor prognosis, therefore Msi2 may be considered as a prognostic marker for acute myeloid leukaemia. SUMMARY: Further studies into the molecular pathways through which Msi2 modulates primitive progenitor function will provide insight into the regulation of normal haematopoiesis and a better understanding of the mechanisms governing the leukaemic transformation process. This will be crucial for the development of effective therapies.\n",
      "Although the cure of acute leukaemia has improved significantly, many patients will still relapse and die. The unraveling of the molecular pathogenesis of acute leukaemia has lead to the identification of new prognostic factors and improved the detection of minimal residual disease. The treatment of relapsed acute leukaemia with chemotherapy remains unsatisfactory. Allogeneic or autologous blood and marrow transplant (BMT) can cure a subset of patients with relapsed acute leukaemia. The identification of the graft-vs-leukaemia (GVL) effect has lead to the development of donor lymphocyte infusions to re-induce remission in patients with relapsed leukaemia after allogeneic BMT and also stimulated the development of the less toxic nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplant approach. The identification of molecular targets of therapy and the development of monoclonal antibody-directed therapy has generated optimism. It is possible that combinations of chemotherapy, molecularly directed therapy, and immunotherapy may be combined to cure an increasing proportion of patients with acute leukaemia.\n",
      "DNAs from chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) were assayed for transforming genes by transfection into NIH 3T3 cells. Foci DNA was tagged with a geneticin-resistance cosmid, then followed through a drug selection and tumorigenicity assay. Activated Ha-ras genes, with point mutations at codon 12 (glycine to valine) were subsequently detected. The mutation was detected in the original samples by either MspI/HpaII digestion or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although mutations in the ras gene family may occur frequently in leukaemias, these are the first examples of Ha-ras mutations in CGL (blast crisis) and CMML.\n",
      "Normal cell development and function is dependent upon controlled gene expression. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that can play an important role in the control of gene expression. DNA methylation at cytosine residues in gene promoter CpG sequences is known to inhibit gene transcription. Inappropriate inhibition of the transcription of tumour suppressor genes, genes that inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis and genes involved in DNA repair by uncontrolled methylation, can lead to unregulated growth and proliferation of a cell and carcinogenesis. Promoter hypermethylation affecting the p16 gene, resulting in gene silencing, has been shown to occur in many human solid tumours and a 'hypermethylation profile' in some leukaemias has been defined. The molecular mechanisms by which aberrant DNA methylation takes place during carcinogenesis are still not clear. However, the large number of target genes (involved in tumorigenesis) that are silenced by aberrant methylation suggests that inhibition of this process may have potential as cancer therapy. Decitabine (NSC-127716, Dacogen; SuperGen) is a potent and specific hypomethylating agent and an inhibitor of the DNA methyltransferase activity that mediates DNA methylation. Decitabine has been shown to have a broad range of antineoplastic activity in preclinical studies. This agent has exhibited significant activity in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia, although clinical Phase I and II studies with solid tumours have not been very promising. Phase II and III studies are currently ongoing to evaluate decitabine, both alone and in combination, in various stages of these haematological malignancies.\n",
      "The enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is the hallmark of the myeloid lineage. We have analysed the presence of MPO in blasts from 180 cases of acute leukaemia (103 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 77 acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) by means of monoclonal antibodies anti-MPO and immunocytochemistry (alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase method). The aim of the study was to investigate the specificity and sensitivity of this marker compared with MPO cytochemistry by light (LM) and electron microscopy (EM), and with the expression of myeloid antigens. Anti-MPO was positive (greater than 3% blasts) in all but one of the 90 AML positive by LM cytochemistry. Of 13 AML cases negative by MPO cytochemistry, six showed 3-10% blasts reactive with anti-MPO and were also positive with antibodies to CD13 and/or CD33. The presence of MPO was confirmed in four of these by EM. The overall positivity of anti-MPO in AML was 92%. Anti-MPO was negative in all but two ALL (6% and 8% positive blasts). The blasts in these two cases were also CD13, CD33 and MPO positive by EM; both were thus reclassified as biphenotypic. Another two ALL reinterpreted as biphenotypic were negative by MPO cytochemistry and anti-MPO but were MPO positive by EM and with CD13 and/or CD33. We conclude that anti-MPO is a sensitive and specific early marker of myeloid blasts and should be incorporated in the routine immunophenotyping of acute leukaemia.\n",
      "Survival from childhood leukaemia has increased, but the proportion of children cured is unknown. The proportion 'cured' is defined as the proportion of survivors for whom, as a group, there is no longer excess mortality compared to the general population. Average time to cure is defined as the time since diagnosis at which the excess mortality rate has declined to or below a predetermined small value. Data on children diagnosed with leukaemia during 1971-2000 in Great Britain were used to estimate trends in survival, the proportion cured and the average time to cure. Five-year survival for all types of leukaemia combined rose from 33 to 79% by 2000. The percentage cured rose from 25 to 68% by 1995; it is predicted to increase to 73% for those diagnosed more recently. Average time to cure increased from 12 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 11-14) to 19 years (95% CI: 14-26) for lymphoid leukaemia (average annual increase of 0.3 years; P<0.001), but remained at about 5 years for acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia. The proportion of children cured of leukaemia has risen dramatically, but the period of excess mortality associated with lymphoid leukaemia has also increased, possibly because of late relapse, secondary malignancy and toxicity from treatment.\n",
      "The most effective therapy to prolong remission and to increase cure rates in patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia is uncertain, and approaches vary from one course of consolidation to two years of maintenance and intensification therapy. We report the results of brief intensive therapy with daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside and thioguanine, and no maintenance therapy, in 72 patients with a minimum follow-up period of two years. The complete remission rate was 67%, the median duration of remission was 11 months, and 23% of patients whose leukaemias went into remission, have remained in remission for three years and longer. These results are equivalent to those that have been reported with long-term chemotherapy.\n",
      "In order to assess the clinical advantage of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) without ex vivo purging, the results in 26 patients (10 AML, 16 ALL) in 1. CR were analyzed retrospectively. All patients received 3 consolidation cycles \"in-vivo purging\" before marrow harvesting. Beside relapses infections and cardiac failure were the most frequent complications. After 1 to 12.5 months 11 cases relapsed with a higher probability in patients who had a longer period of induction and between CR and ABMT. 12 patients became relapse-free survivors 6 to 53 months after ABMT with a stable plateau after 12.5 months for 8 patients. In conclusion, ABMT following \"in-vivo purging\" as the strongest one-step postremission therapy in patients with acute leukaemias may be a way for better long-term results in these patients.\n",
      "Childhood cancer is rare comprising less than 1% of all malignancies diagnosed each year in developed countries. Leukaemia is the commonest form of cancer in children accounting for around a third of all childhood cancer, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) being the most prevalent. Biologically specific subtypes of ALL and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), the other major morphological type of childhood leukaemia, are characterised by chromosomal changes. Whilst over 200 genes have been associated with chromosomal translocations, to date, only MLL, TEL, and AML1 have been linked with childhood leukaemia. Interestingly, there is increasing evidence to support the theory that gene rearrangements such as these may originate in utero. As with many other human diseases, both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the aetiology of the disease. Although much has been documented with regard to diet, smoking, alcohol consumption and recreational and prescription drug use during pregnancy, there is no consistent evidence to support a link with any of these factors and childhood leukaemia. However, findings from studies investigating prenatal and early life exposures are often based on small numbers of cases as both the type of cancer and exposure are rare. Furthermore, accurate information relating to past exposures can be difficult to obtain and is often reliant on self-reporting. To further our understanding of the aetiology of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma, there are areas which clearly warrant investigation. These include collection of parental dietary folate data combined with genetic analysis of the folate related genes, in utero exposure to DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, and the possible effects of assisted reproduction technology on disease susceptibility.\n",
      "Paclitaxel (Taxol) has been shown to be clinically effective in treatment of patients with breast and ovarian cancer. It has also shown promising results in various other solid tumours. Paclitaxel has induced apoptosis in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in both HL-60 and U937 human leukaemia cells. A recent study has shown a dose-dependent cytotoxicity for both taxanes: paclitaxel (taxol) and docetaxel (Taxotere) on fresh leukaemia cells in primary culture from 16 ALL and four AML patients and proposed their use in treatment of acute leukaemia patients. AML is a heterogeneous disease in which malignant transformation and disease progression occur at the level of CD34 positive cells. Also, the multi-drug resistance gene product, P-glycoprotein is expressed only in CD34 positive AML cells. Therefore, an in vitro evaluation of the efficacy of paclitaxel, a P-glycoprotein substrate, in CD34 positive AML cells is warranted before considering its clinical use in acute leukaemia patients. Since all in vitro studies of paclitaxel reported so far have involved only CD34 negative (HL-60, U937, K562) human AML cells, the aim of the present study was to evaluate paclitaxel efficacy against CD34 positive AML cells. The IC50 of paclitaxel for apoptosis was significantly higher in MHH225 CD34 positive cells (12 +/- 2 microM) than in U937 CD34 negative cells (1.7 +/- 0.2 microM), P < 0.001. Paclitaxel has a significantly weaker cytotoxic effect on CD34 positive AML cells. One log higher concentration of paclitaxel was required in MHH225 CD34 positive AML cells to achieve the same apoptosis level achieved in U937 CD34 negative leukaemia cells. Also, at the high concentration achievable in vivo: 10 microM paclitaxel, only half the MHH225 CD34 positive AML cells were apoptotic versus 72% of U937 CD34 negative leukaemia cells. Clearly, paclitaxel has only weak or modest in vitro efficacy compared with several conventional anti-leukaemia drugs used in AML treatment. The present results support the poor level of in vivo induction of apoptosis achieved during a phase I clinical study with paclitaxel therapy in 26 leukaemia patients. Also, the present results have shown a significant increase in nitric oxide production during paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in U937 monocytic leukaemia cells, confirming the vital role of nitric oxide in mediating paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by monocytic cells. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated a clear difference between the effect of paclitaxel on CD34 negative and CD34 positive AML cells. Given its poor performance in the phase I clinical study of 26 acute leukaemia patients and the present weak in vitro cytotoxic effect, it is unlikely that paclitaxel will have a role in the treatment of acute leukaemia. Also, the present study emphasises the need to use CD34 positive AML cells such as MHH225 rather than the unsuitable lineage-specific CD34 negative cells such as HL-60 or U937 for in vitro pre-clinical screening of potential novel effective anti-leukaemia agents.\n",
      "The patterns of genetic change, clonal evolution, natural history and latency are very different in the paediatric leukaemias compared with adult epithelial cancers but are similar to those in other childhood cancers of mesenchymal stem cell origin. This distinction has a biological logic in the context of the selective pressures for clonal emergence in different developmental and cellular contexts and has a major impact on curability. Most childhood leukaemias and some other mesenchymal stem cell tumours are of fetal origin and can metastasize without corruption of restraints on cell proliferation or bypassing apoptosis. In marked contrast to most invasive or metastatic epithelial carcinomas in adults, these former cancers then retain sensitivity to therapeutic apoptosis. Moreover, their abbreviated and less complex evolutionary status is associated with less genetic diversity and instability, minimising opportunity for clonal selection for resistance. A minority of leukaemias in children and a higher fraction in adults do, however, have genetic alterations that bypass cell cycle controls and apoptosis imposition. These are the 'bad news' genotypes. The cellular and molecular diversity of acute leukaemia impacts also on aetiology. Paediatric acute leukaemias can be initiated prenatally by illegitimate recombination and fusion gene formation in fetal haemopoiesis. For acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children, twin studies suggest that a secondary postnatal molecular event is also required. This may be promoted by an abnormal or delayed response to common infections. Even for a classic case of a cancer that is intrinsically curable by systematic chemotherapy i.e. childhood ALL, prevention may turn out to be the preferred option.\n",
      "The expression of interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R) was examined in 328 adult patients with non-T-cell (non-T) acute leukaemia and blast crisis of chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML.BC) using two monoclonal antibodies, anti-Tac for IL-2R alpha chain (IL-2R alpha) and Mik beta 1 for IL-2R beta chain (IL-2R beta). Leukaemic cells in the following cases were positive for anti-Tac; 28/192 of acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML), 24/44 CML-BC, 4/28 CD19(+)CD10(-) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and 20/64 common ALL (c-ALL). IL-2R beta was not detected on leukaemic cells of any case examined. Eleven of IL-2R alpha(+) AML were derived from myelodysplastic syndrome. None of the IL-2R alpha positive leukaemic cells responded to exogenous recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) in culture. In addition, IL-2R alpha expression on non-T leukaemic cells was closely correlated with coexpressing different lineage markers and the presence of the Philadelphia abnormality. Marked increase of serum soluble IL-2R alpha was demonstrated in the IL-2R alpha(+) patients examined. Clinically, the IL-2R alpha(+) patients showed significantly lower response to chemotherapy and poorer prognosis than IL-2R alpha(-) patients. Our results clearly indicate the diagnostic importance of IL-2R alpha expression in non-T acute leukaemia with a close relation to the particular cellular characteristics and the prognosis.\n",
      "Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a generic term that include five apparently distinct entities. The best known form, the classical Ph-positive subtype, accounts for about 90% of all cases of CML. The morphology of its presentation blood film is highly characteristic but is also seen in about half of the remaining 10% of cases, which are Ph-negative. This classical morphological subtype, whether Ph-positive or Ph-negative I describe as 'chronic granulocytic leukaemia' to refer to the exuberant granulocytic proliferation which is its hallmark. This term is often used indiscriminately and interchangeably with 'chronic myeloid leukaemia' and similar terms, just as 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia' was, until recently, used to cover the chronic lymphoid leukaemias in general, but is now used in a specific sense. Chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), whether Ph-positive or Ph-negative, is almost always BCR-rearranged and associated with the production of a unique 210-kd protein with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. Most of the remaining cases of Ph-negative CML are examples of either chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), a subtype almost as homogeneous as CGL, and characterized in its presentation blood film by the presence of monocytes and neutrophils but few immature granulocytes, or atypical CML (aCML), distinct from and less homogeneous than either CGL or CMML, in which some cases also share features with CGL while others share some with CMML. CMML and aCML do not show BCR rearrangement and are not associated with the production of p210kd. CGL, CMML, and aCML, though characterized on morphological features differ in their clinical features and behaviour, response to treatment and survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "In mice, external X- or gamma-irradiation may induce thymic lymphomas or myeloid leukaemias, while bone-seeking alpha-emitters may induce osteosarcomas and, to a lesser extent, acute myeloid leukaemia. The present paper aims to review briefly some of the experimental data with respect to the molecular mechanisms underlying these radiation-induced carcinogenic processes. Thymic lymphomagenesis proceeds through an indirect mechanism. Recombinant proviruses often occur in the tumour cell DNA, favouring the idea that they might be involved. However, there are indications that they might mediate tumour growth rather than induction. It is plausible that activation of ras oncogenes by somatic point mutations might play a role in the carcinogenic process, although at a yet undetermined stage. Myeloid leukaemogenesis is characterized by a very early, putative initiating event, consisting of non-random rearrangements and/or deletions of chromosome 2. These may be related to deletions in the developmentally important homeobox gene clusters and to rearrangements of the sequences flanking the IL-1 beta gene. Either a gene of the homeobox family or IL-1 beta might be considered as potentially involved in the induction process. Osteosarcomagenesis in mice is often associated with the expression of proviruses, and the tumours often contain somatically acquired proviruses. These viruses may contribute to tumour development by affecting various growth-suppressor genes. Viruses isolated from bone tumours, although non-sarcomagenic, induce osteopetrosis, osteomas and lymphomas upon infection of newborn mice. Osteogenic tumours frequently display amplification of a region on mouse chromosome 15, which encompasses c-myc and Mlvi-1 sequences. Enhanced transcription of various oncogenes is found in individual tumours, but no specificity for osteosarcomas has been identified. In vitro systems of skeletoblast differentiation are being developed to study tumour induction in vitro.\n",
      "AIMS: Cytogenetic and molecular aberrations are the strongest factors in determining outcome in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). AML with complex karyotype confers a particularly poor prognosis and is associated with morphologic dysplasia. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) has been investigated in defining dysplasia within myelodysplastic syndromes, but little is known about immunophenotypic dysplasia in AML and correlation with genetic abnormalities. This study aimed to explore differences in antigen expression by FCI in AML with complex karyotype (AML-CK) and AML with complex karyotype and TP53 mutations (AML-TP53) compared with AML with normal karyotype (AML-NK). METHODS: Twenty-five cases of AML-CK, 13 of which had abnormalities of TP53, were compared with 83 cases of AML-NK using FCI. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated brighter expression of CD34 with decreased CD33 and aberrant expression of CD5 in blasts of AML-CK, while AML-TP53 blasts exhibited brighter expression of CD13. Granulocytes in AML-CK exhibited brighter expression of CD5, CD7, CD10 and CD14, with brighter CD3 also seen in AML-TP53. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that immunophenotypic dysplasia correlates with complex karyotype and TP53 mutation, including increased expression of T-cell antigens.\n",
      "FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is critical for normal haematopoiesis and have been reported to be expressed in the majority of acute myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. We correlated the impact of FLT3 mutations and its expression with age, WHO 2008 classification and treatment outcome in 531 childhood acute leukaemias. Of 150 acute myeloid leukaemia (AMLs), 18 (12%) harboured FLT3-ITD while nine (6%) had FLT3-TKD. FLT3-ITD and -TKD were rare in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL; FLT3-ITD 0/26, FLT3-TKD 1/26) and children below 3 years (n = 2/48). Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) with t(15;17);PML-RARα (n = 7/18; 39%) harboured the highest frequency of FLT3 mutations, followed by myelomonocytic (n = 4/18; 22%) and AML with t(8;21);RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (n = 2/21; 9%). FLT3 expression levels were also lowest in AMKL, both in Down and non-Down (p = 0.002) followed by patients <3 years (p = 0.001). The rarity of FLT3 mutations and expression levels in AMKL were independent of age. Conversely, only 2% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) harboured FLT3 mutations (ITD = 1/381; TKD = 6/381). FLT3 was highly expressed in hyperdiploid ALL (p < 0.001). Of the 121 AMLs with clinical history, there were no significant differences in 4-year event-free survival (EFS) (46% vs. 38%; p = 0.46) and overall-survival (OS) (55% vs. 43%; p = 0.30) between FLT3-wildtype and ITD+ patients. Similarly, FLT3 expression levels did not influence survival in AML in both the good risk and non-good risk subgroups. FLT3 does not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of AMKL, both in Down and non-Down. Therapeutic targets using FLT3 inhibitors may not be useful in AMKL and in young children with AML.\n",
      "The prevalence of the plasma bovine leukaemia virus blocking factor was examined in a commercial herd. The detection of the blocking factor activity depended on the nature of the infected target cells used in the assay. Using the sensitive bovine leukaemia virus-infected target lymphocytes, the factor was found to be significantly more prevalent in infected cattle than in virus-free cattle. Furthermore, in infected cattle, no correlation was observed between the level of bovine leukaemia virus antibody and the presence of the blocking factor.\n",
      "The EORTC Children Leukemia Group (CLG) is part of the offspring of the EORTC Hemopathies Working Party which in 1978 split into a paediatric and to an 'adult' branch. At that time, the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) designed by H. Riehm for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) appeared much more efficacious than all others and the CLG decided to adapt that treatment strategy for its own clinical trials. The main results of these may be summarised as follows:for standard risk patients, the deletion of cyclophosphamide from consolidation and reconsolidation courses does not jeopardise the patient outcomefor medium- and high-risk patients receiving high-dose methotrexate (MTX), cranial radiotherapy is superfluouswith the dose scheduling of the BFM regimen, E-Coli L-Asparaginase is more efficacious than Erwinia L-Asparaginasethe addition of monthly intravenous (i.v.) 6-mercaptopurine to conventional maintenance chemotherapy is detrimentalthe assessment by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of minimal residual disease at completion of induction is feasible in a cooperative setting and can be used as a powerful and independent prognostic factor. The CLG also conducted clinical studies of acute myeloblastic leukaemia. Since 1989, lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphomas have been treated within the ALL trials. The CLG collaborates with other Groups within the I-BFM Study Group and participants in the meta-analytic studies conducted by the Oxford team by the Oxford Children ALL Collaborative Group.\n",
      "One hundred and ninety-one patients with acute leukaemia who received bone marrow from HLA-A, -B and -DR identical unrelated donors and were reported to EBMT and/or IMUST, were matched with 382 patients receiving autologous bone marrow for diagnosis, age, stage of disease and year of transplantation. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly higher in recipients of unrelated marrow compared to autograft recipients, 44 +/- 4% (+/- 95% confidence interval) and 15 +/- 3% at 2 years in the two groups, respectively (P < 10(-4)). In contrast, relapse probability was lower in recipients of unrelated marrow, being 32 +/- 5% at 2 years compared to 55 +/- 3% in recipients of autografts (P < 10(-4)). Two-year leukaemia-free survival (LFS) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was 39 +/- 5% and 32 +/- 3% in the two groups, respectively. Among patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the corresponding figures were 36 +/- 6% and 46 +/- 5% in the two groups, respectively (P = NS). In AML in first remission (CR-1), the 2-year survival was 42 +/- 10% in recipients of unrelated bone marrow, compared to 69 +/- 8% in autograft recipients (P = 0.008). When all patients with acute leukaemia were included, the 2-year LFS was 38% in recipients of unrelated marrow, compared to 37% in autograft recipients (NS). In conclusion, this retrospective analysis supports the design of a prospective randomized study in patients with high-risk/advanced acute leukaemia who lack a suitable related bone marrow donor, to ascertain which of the two strategies, if any, should be favoured.\n",
      "A case of clinically typical CML (300 x 10(6)/l leukocytes, 400 x 10(6)/l platelets, splenomegaly) is presented. After complete remission induced by busulphan, no clinical or haematological abnormalities were observed for 27 years until the development of acute leukaemia (type M1), which was rapidly fatal after a brief chemotherapy-induced remission. The cytogenetic findings were also original: no chromosome Ph1 (during remission 3 years after the onset of the disease), no translocation (banding study 5 years later), and no bcr/abl rearrangement (during the terminal phase).\n",
      "Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) exhibits peculiar epidemiological, clinical, cytogenetic and molecular features, compared to the other acute myeloid leukaemias (AML). Data on epidemiology and occupational risk factors for APL desumed from the GIMEMA archive are reported and compared with those of the other AML. An exploratory case-case study was designed on AML patients from 56 haematology centres in Italy. Overall, 4296 patients older than 15 yr with a new diagnosis of acute leukaemia were recorded between July 1992 and July 1997. Of these, 335 were classified as APL, and 2894 as other AML. The median age of APL patients was 43 compared to 59 yr for the other AML (p < 0.00001). In order to identify peculiar risk factors for APL development, different parameters were compared in the 2 groups. After adjusting by age no significant differences were observed with regard to education, lifetime prevalence of cancer among siblings and previous diseases in the patient history. Occupational exposure as a possible risk factor for APL showed no increased risk compared to other AML among farmers, builders and leather workers. A significant association was found in electricians (OR=4.4, 95% CI=2.0-9.7) and a weak association was found in wood workers (OR=3.2, 95% CI=0.8-10.8). The proportion of APL with respect to other AML was significantly higher in the north east of Italy compared to the rest of the country (OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.3-2.2). These data confirm the younger age of APL patients compared to the other AML. A possible role of electromagnetic fields is suggested by the higher risk of APL in electrical workers and in the more industrialized areas of the country.\n",
      "In a multicentre trial involving 20 transplant centres from 10 countries haematopoietic stem cells were obtained either from the bone marrow of 33 sibling donors or from the peripheral blood of 33 such donors after administration of filgrastim (10 microg/kg/day). The haematopoietic stem cells were infused into their HLA-identical recipients suffering from acute leukaemias in remission or chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase. PBPC donors tolerated filgrastim administration and leukapheresis well with the most frequent side-effects being musculoskeletal pain, headache, and mild increases of LDH, AP, Gamma-GT or SGPT. Pain and haematoma at the harvest site and mild anaemia were the most frequent complaints of BM donors. Severe or life-threatening complications were not seen with any type of harvest procedure. Time to platelet recovery greater than 20 x 10(9)/l was 15 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 13-16 days) in the PBPCT group and 19 days (CI 16-25) in the BMT group. Time to neutrophil recovery greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/l was 14 days (CI 12-15 days) in the PBPCT group as compared to 15 days (CI 15-16 days) in the BMT group. The numbers of platelet transfusions administered to PBPCT and BMT patients were 12 (range: 1-28) and 10 (range: 3-39), respectively. Sixteen patients (48%) transplanted with bone marrow and 18 patients (54%) transplanted with PBPC developed acute GVHD of grades II-IV; acute GVHD of grades III or IV developed in six (18%) and seven (21%) patients, respectively. Kaplan-Meier plots for transplant-related mortality until day 100 and leukaemia-free survival at a median of 400 days after BMT or PBPCT showed no significant differences. Administration of filgrastim and leukapheresis in normal donors were feasible and well tolerated. The number of days with restricted activity and of nights spent in hospital was lower in donors of PBPC. Transplantation of PBPC to HLA-identical siblings with early leukaemia resulted in earlier platelet engraftment. The incidence of moderate to severe acute GVHD, transplant-related mortality, and leukaemia-free survival did not show striking differences. Further investigation of allogeneic PBPCT as a substitute for allogeneic BMT is warranted.\n",
      "We examined mRNA expression and internal tandem duplication of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene in haematological malignancies by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and genomic PCR followed by sequencing. By RT-PCR, expression of FLT3 was detected in 45/74 (61%) leukaemia cell lines and the frequency of expression of FLT3 was significantly higher in undifferentiated type (B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; ALL) than in differentiated type cell lines (B-ALL) (P = 0.0076). Using the genomic PCR method, 194 fresh samples including 87 acute myeloid leukaemias, 60 ALLs, 32 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and 15 juvenile chronic myelogenous leukaemias (JCMLs) were examined. Tandem duplication was found in 12 (13.8%) AMLs and two (3.3%) ALLs. Sequence analyses of the 14 samples with the duplication revealed that eight showed a simple tandem duplication and six a tandem duplication with insertion. Most of these tandem duplications occurred within exon 11, and two duplications occurred from exon 11 to intron 11 and exon 12. No tandem duplications of FLT3 gene were detected in MDS or JCML. The frequency of tandem duplication of FLT3 gene in childhood AML was lower than that in adult AML so far reported. All of the 12 AML patients with the duplication died within 47 months after diagnosis, whereas two ALL patients with the duplication have survived 44 and 72 months, respectively. These two ALL patients expressed both lymphoid and myeloid antigens and were considered to have biphenotypic leukaemia. These results suggest that tandem duplication is involved in ALL in addition to AML, but not in childhood MDS or JCML, and that childhood AML patients with the tandem duplication have a poor prognosis.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal and lung cancer. Studies suggesting similar associations in leukaemia have been small and underpowered. We have conducted a large population-based case-control study to determine whether the use of NSAIDs is associated with a reduced risk of acute and chronic leukaemias, and whether their use has any impact on survival in these patients. METHODS: We identified all the incident cases of leukaemia in 'The Health Improvement Network' (THIN) general practice dataset, along with at least four matched controls per case. We used conditional logistic regression to determine odds ratios for NSAID prescription rates and the risk of developing several leukaemia sub-types. We then used Cox regression to determine the association between NSAID prescription rate and risk of death in leukaemia. Hazard ratios were adjusted for gender, age at diagnosis, smoking status and Townsend Score. RESULTS: The risk of leukaemia overall appears to increase marginally with increased use of NSAIDs prior to diagnosis. This is not seen when individual leukaemia sub-types are examined, however, except perhaps in CLL where patients who had received 2-5 prescriptions/year are 34% more likely to be diagnosed with CLL than those who had not had any NSAID prescriptions (O.R. 1.34, p = 0.03, 95% C.I. 1.02-1.74). There was no statistically significant association between exposure to NSAIDs prior to leukaemia diagnosis and survival. CONCLUSION: The use of NSAIDs does not reduce the risk of developing leukaemia, nor do they improve survival.\n",
      "Leptomeningeal malignancy complicates childhood cancers, including leukaemias, brain tumours, and solid tumours. In leukaemia, such malignancy is thought to invade leptomeninges via the vascular route. In brain tumours, dissemination from the primary tumour, before or after surgery, via CSF pathways is assumed; however, evidence exists to support the vascular route of dissemination. Success in treating leptomeningeal malignancy represents a rate-limiting step to cure, which has been successfully overcome in leukaemia with intensified systemic therapy combined with intra-CSF therapy, which replaced cranial radiotherapy for many patients. This de-escalated CNS-directed therapy is still associated with some neurotoxicity. The balanced benefit justifies exploration of ways to further de-escalate CNS-directed therapy. For primary brain tumours, standard therapy is craniospinal radiotherapy, but attendant risk of acute and delayed brain injury and endocrine deficiencies compounds post-radiation impairment of spinal growth. Alternative ways of treating leptomeninges by intensifying drug therapy delivered to CSF are being investigated-preliminary evidence suggests improved outcomes. This Review seeks to describe methods of intra-CSF drug delivery and drugs in use, and consider how the technique could be modified and additional drugs might be selected for this route of administration.\n",
      "Clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes as well as both T cell receptor (TCR) delta and gamma genes were found in four cases of blast crisis of Ph+ chronic myeloid leukaemia with unequivocal B cell precursor (common) immunophenotype. In one case, the TCR beta chain gene was also rearranged. Although the developmental sequence of TCR delta, gamma and beta rearrangements in T lymphocytes appeared to be respected, a full phenotypic effect, characteristic of T cell was not observed in these otherwise typical 'common' blast cells. Cytogenetic analysis ruled out the occurrence of TCR rearrangement due to structural chromosome changes. A high incidence of unexpected TCR gene rearrangements has been previously reported in the de novo 'common' acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL). Our cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis show that genotypic similarities may exist between these two haematological entities.\n",
      "The upfront application of molecular methods for identifying the fusion transcripts arising from balanced translocations in haematopoietic malignancies has several advantages: sensitivity is independent of its frequency, i.e. rare ones are not missed, cytogenetically cryptic aberrations are identified and it provides a platform for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection. Employing a multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay identifying 27 fusion transcripts we prospectively analysed blood and/or bone marrow samples from 390 patients referred for diagnosis and treatment for acute leukaemia and chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) from a geographically well-defined region in Denmark. A total of 233 patients were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 95 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) origin and 62 patients were recorded as CMPD. Twenty-three percent AML, 32% ALL and 55% CMPD patients exhibited chromosomal aberrations detected by the multiplex RT-PCR. Cytogenetically cryptic translocations were seen in 15% of the cases. Conversely, the cytogenetic analysis identified chromosomal aberrations other than translocations in 45% of AML cases and 63% of ALL cases. We conclude that, while the fraction of translocation positive leukaemia patients in an unselected cohort is lower than hitherto believed, a molecular approach to their diagnosis is worthwhile, partly for identifying cryptic and rare translocations, partly for monitoring MRD.\n",
      "Improvement of survival in lymphocytic leukaemia has been accompanied by the occurrence of second primary cancer (SPCs). Based on Swedish Family Cancer Database, we applied bi-directional analyses in which relative risks (RRs) were calculated for any SPCs in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and the risks of these leukaemias as SPCs. After CLL, RRs were significant for 20 SPCs, and high for skin squamous cell cancer (24·58 for in situ and 7·63 for invasive), Merkel cell carcinoma (14·36), Hodgkin lymphoma (7·16) and Kaposi sarcoma (6·76). Conversely, 15 CLL cancer pairs were reciprocally increased. The increased risks were reciprocal for ALL and four cancers. RR for ALL was 15·35 after myeloid neoplasia. HCL showed reciprocally increased RRs with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma. The concordance between RRs for bi-directional associations between CLL and different cancers, and HCL and different cancers was highly significant. For CLL (also for HCL), the bi-directional risks with skin cancers and other immune-related cancers suggest the probable involvement of immune dysfunction. For ALL, treatment may contribute to risks of multiple SPCs. Increased risk of ALL after haematological neoplasms may indicate bone marrow dysfunction. These findings may help guide treatment decisions and prognostic assessment.\n",
      "We have reviewed 215 published cases of leukaemia and transient leukaemia in Down syndrome. There is an over-representation of mosaic trisomy 21, possibly the result, at least in part, of a survival effect. The most intriguing observation is a bimodal distribution of maternal age, produced largely because cases with true leukaemia have a significantly higher maternal age than cases with transient leukaemia (33.5 versus 29.5 years). In conjunction with evidence that meiosis I nondisjunction is infrequent in transient leukaemia, this suggests different mechanisms for the etiology of leukaemia and transient leukaemia, and favours a locus predisposing to transient leukaemia proximal to the centromere on the long arm of chromosome 21.\n",
      "Acute leukaemias have traditionally been classified according to the nature of the predominating cells as judged by cytomorphology and cytochemistry. A codification of this classification into L1-L3 subdivisions for lymphoblastic cases (ALL) and M1-M7 for myeloid cases (AML), proposed by the FAB group of haematologists, has been used extensively in the past decade. Some criticisms of this codification are presented and other approaches to classification are discussed. Among these are included the potential importance of multiple lineage expression, measurements of cell differentiation using cytochemical criteria, the relevance of isoenzyme biochemistry of leukaemic cell populations, their surface antigenic differences as demonstrated by the use of monoclonal antibodies and the growing contribution of cytogenetics. The development and complexity of combined classifications which attempt to incorporate most of these features is illustrated. A simplified classification into broad groups is proposed, ALL being divided by surface antigenic and cytogenetic criteria and AML by morphology and cytochemistry. These groups may be further elaborated as appropriate.\n",
      "During the last two decades, the treatment of leukaemia has changed significantly; increasing intensity of chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation have lead to profound immunosuppression, prolonged stays in hospital, vascular catheterization, administration of broad spectrum antimicrobial agents and extensive use of prophylactic antifungal drugs. All but the last of these risk factors have increased the incidence of fungal infections in leukaemic patients and have significantly changed the spectrum of pathogens in favour of non-Candida species. In major haematological centres in Europe and the US, the proportion of non-Candida yeast isolated from patients increased from 1 to 5% in 1980 to 10 to 25% after 1990. However, there are not enough data to assess whether mortality due to these species is higher than that due to Candida spp. (30-40%) or filamentous fungi (50-70%). In this article, specific risk factors and therapeutic outcome of yeast infections other than Candida spp. in leukaemia such as Malassezia furfur, Trichosporon spp., Blastoschizomyces capitatus, Rhodotorula rubra, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Clavispora lusitaniae, Cryptococcus laurentii and Hansenula anomala are reviewed. An analysis of risk factors from the National Cancer Institute, Bratislava has shown that non-Candida yeast infections (N = 15) in cancer patients are associated with leukaemia and neutropenia (P = < 0.002, 0.005), more often fatal than those caused by C. albicans (N = 51) (P < 0.006) but not non-albicans Candida (N = 34) and are associated with quinolone (P < 0.0001) and itraconazole prophylaxis (P < or = 0.05, 0.015) compared to both C. albicans or non-albicans Candida respectively.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Few population-based epidemiological studies of adults have examined the relationship between air pollution and leukaemias. METHODS: Using Danish National Cancer Registry data and Danish DEHM-UBM-AirGIS system-modelled air pollution exposures, we examined whether particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) averaged over 1, 5 or 10 years were associated with adult leukaemia in general or by subtype. In all, 14,986 adult cases diagnosed 1989-2014 and 51,624 age, sex and time-matched controls were included. Separate conditional logistic regression models, adjusted for socio-demographic factors, assessed exposure to each pollutant with leukaemias. RESULTS: Fully adjusted models showed a higher risk of leukaemia with higher 1-, 5- and 10-year-average exposures to PM2.5 prior to diagnosis (e.g. OR per 10 µg/m3 for 10-year average: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.32), and a positive relationship with 1-year average BC. Results were driven by participants 70 years and older (OR per 10 µg/m3 for 10-year average: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.15-1.58). Null findings for younger participants. Higher 1-year average PM2.5 exposures were associated with higher risks for acute myeloid and chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Among older adults, higher risk for leukaemia was associated with higher residential PM2.5 concentrations averaged over 1, 5 and 10 years prior to diagnosis.\n",
      "Several disturbances of the coagulation system are associated with malignancies of the hematopoietic system. The primary mechanisms of these are disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyperviscosity. As such, bleeding or thrombotic events are often encountered and, occasionally, they may even be the inaugural symptom of leukaemia. The lack of a diagnostic tool that would enable a rapid diagnosis of a hematopoietic malignancy, which may present initially as, for example, a coagulation disorder (arterial or venous thrombotic event and/or haemorrhage), can have dramatic consequences. The treatment of choice for this clinical condition is chemotherapy associated with leukopheresis with the aim of obtaining a rapid cytoreduction. We report here a case relevant to this situation and attempt to assess current knowledge on the ethiopathogenesis and treatment of coagulation abnormalities in leukaemia. Our report highlights the imperative need for immediate haematological diagnosis despite the non-specific presentation.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Although cancer-related fatigue has been given priority status for study in Western countries, unfortunately, it has not received enough attention in China. Based on a different cultural perspective, qualitative study regarding cancer-related fatigue in China can provide a cultural context for enriching the system of knowledge about fatigue. OBJECTIVES: To explore the real-life experiences of fatigue from the perspectives of Chinese Children with leukaemia. DESIGN: A phenomenological study. SETTING: A paediatric haematology oncology department of a regional tertiary children hospital in Shanghai, China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14 children and adolescents with leukaemia, aged 7-18 years old, without known psychiatric or developmental disorders, was selected by purposive sampling. METHODS: Four focus group interviews were conducted with nine open-ended, semi-structured questions. FINDINGS: Cancer-related fatigue is a common and distressing issue for Chinese children and adolescents with leukaemia. Three themes were finally generated: 'fatigue is an open interpretation among children and adolescents', 'fatigue is not a single-dimensional aspect', and truggles with fatigue and balancing life suffering'. Fatigue, which is closely related to physical, psychological and situational factors, has negative affects on the participants physically, psychologically and on their cognitive well-being, and can impact the family, school and social interaction of children with leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents could easily distinguish cancer-related fatigue from normal fatigue. The participants' message to health professionals is that fatigue is a multidimensional and multifactorial symptom that should be comprehensively understood and managed. The findings provide insight and direction for clinical practice and research regarding intervention development and education plans for cancer-related fatigue for paediatric oncology patients.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In 2002, a poster alerted the French health authorities to the possibility that the risk of childhood leukaemia might be increased by hepatitis B vaccination. Elucidating the role of vaccination in the aetiology of childhood acute leukaemia (AL) was therefore included in the objectives of an ongoing national study. METHODS: The ESCALE study was a French national population-based case-control study conducted in France in 2003 and 2004 in order to investigate the role of infectious, environmental and genetic factors in four childhood neoplastic diseases (leukaemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma and brain tumour). The controls were randomly selected from the French population and age and gender frequency matched with the cases. A total of 776 cases of AL (91% of the eligible cases) and 1681 controls (71% of the eligible controls) were included. In a specific standardized telephone interview, which was the same for both the cases and controls, each mother was asked to read out her child complete vaccination record. RESULTS: No association between vaccination and the risk of childhood AL: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or acute myeloblastic leukaemia was observed. No relationship between the risk of leukaemia and the type of vaccine, number of doses of each vaccine, total number of injections, total number of vaccine doses or number of early vaccinations was evidenced. No confounding factor was observed. CONCLUSION: The study did not show any evidence of a role of vaccination in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "Leukaemia is characterized by the accumulation of malignant haematopoietic precursors. Recent studies have revealed that acquired alterations in genes that regulate normal haematopoiesis are frequently detected in leukaemia. The progression to leukaemia depends on additional mutations that promote the survival of developmentally arrested cells. This review describes three examples of this general paradigm of leukaemogenesis: RUNX1 abnormalities in acute leukaemias, GATA1 mutations in the leukaemias of Down syndrome, and SCL and LMO2 ectopic expression in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n",
      "Fanconi anaemia (FA) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) carry a high risk of haematological cancer. Affected cellular pathways may be modulated in sporadic malignancies and silencing of FANCF through methylation has been shown to cause somatic disruption of the FA pathway. Combined bisulphite restriction analysis for methylation of FANCF, FANCB and NBS1 was used to investigate 81 sporadic acute childhood leukaemias. No methylation was detected at any associated CpG sites analysed. This does not exclude very low levels of FANCF, FANCB or NBS1 methylation, but suggests other factors are responsible for chemo-sensitivity and chromosomal instability in sporadic childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "To produce the wide range of blood and immune cell types, haematopoietic stem cells can \"choose\" directly from the entire spectrum of blood cell fate-options. Affiliation to a single cell lineage can occur at the level of the haematopoietic stem cell and these cells are therefore a mixture of some pluripotent cells and many cells with lineage signatures. Even so, haematopoietic stem cells and their progeny that have chosen a particular fate can still \"change their mind\" and adopt a different developmental pathway. Many of the leukaemias arise in haematopoietic stem cells with the bulk of the often partially differentiated leukaemia cells belonging to just one cell type. We argue that the reason for this is that an oncogenic insult to the genome \"hard wires\" leukaemia stem cells, either through development or at some stage, to one cell lineage. Unlike normal haematopoietic stem cells, oncogene-transformed leukaemia stem cells and their progeny are unable to adopt an alternative pathway.\n",
      "Translocations involving the MLL gene on the chromosome 11 (11q23) are frequently observed in acute leukaemia. The detection of this genetic change has a unique significance as a result of its implication of poor prognosis. To reveal the utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in detecting the MLL translocation, we analysed 289 consecutive Korean patients (children and adults) with acute leukaemias using both conventional cytogenetic analysis (CC) and FISH, placing an emphasis on the result discrepancies. Twenty-two of 289 patients (7.6%) had the 11q23/MLL translocation. In nine of 22 patients (41%), only FISH detected the translocation. In eight of these 22 patients, a total of 19 follow-up examinations were performed, of which FISH detected a significant level of leukaemic cells harbouring the MLL translocation in five patients (26%) without cytogenetic evidence. In addition to the MLL translocation, FISH detected submicroscopic amplification, partial deletion of the MLL gene and trisomy 11 in 12 patients without cytogenetic evidence. In summary, up to 41% of the MLL translocations at initial work-up and 26% during follow-up were detected by FISH without cytogenetic evidence. Thus, we recommend that MLL FISH should be performed in the diagnosis and monitoring of acute leukaemias in combination with CC.\n",
      "AIMS: To assess the value of immunophenotyping of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in routinely processed bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens and to establish a minimum panel of antibodies to assess lymphoid lineage and enable differentiation from acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: 45 routinely processed bone marrow biopsy specimens (formalin fixed, paraffin embedded and mildly decalcified in EDTA) reported to contain leukaemic infiltrates on the basis of cytomorphological and enzyme-cytochemical analysis of bone marrow smears (22 c-ALL, 11 T-ALL, 2 B-ALL, 10 u-ALL (unclassified)) were immunostained by the ABC method with a broad panel of 26 antibodies against various haemopoietic antigens. RESULTS: Staining with antibodies directed against myeloperoxidase and lysozyme showed that seven cases were either biphenotypic or mixed leukaemias (2), or of myelogenous origin (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)-M1 (2); AML-M4 (2); AML-M5a (1)). Five of these seven cases had been diagnosed initially as u-ALL. Three further cases with no compact leukaemic infiltrates were excluded. ALL was confirmed in the remaining 35 cases. Because of revised diagnoses, the total numbers of ALL subtypes changed (23 c-ALL, 8 T-ALL, 2 B-ALL, 2 u-ALL). Immunostaining of more than 10% of blast cells in at least one case was found with 19 of the 26 antibodies. The most sensitive lineage specific antibodies for diagnosis were found to be anti-CD10 for c-ALL (22/23) and beta F1 for T-ALL (6/8). Expression of aberrant antigens was fairly common--for example, 7/23 cases of c-ALL stained with antibodies against T cell associated antigens. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical investigation of routinely processed bone marrow biopsy specimens enables reliable detection of ALL subtypes c-ALL and T-ALL. A minimum panel of antibodies, against TdT, CD34, myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, CD10, CD79a, and CD20, and the antibody beta F1, is proposed for the immunophenotyping of acute leukaemia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Monitoring time trends in the incidence of childhood leukaemias and lymphomas requires efficient and continuous data collecting systems. In countries without official cancer registries, such as Greece, ad hoc nationwide registration of incident childhood leukaemias and lymphomas could help elucidate the underlying aetiology and monitor socioeconomic differentials in health care delivery. METHODS: We registered all cases and produced age, gender, type and immunophenotype specific figures and overall crude and age adjusted annual incidence rates and secular trends for 863 leukaemia and 311 lymphoma incident cases diagnosed in children <15 years of age across Greece during 1996-2006, namely the first 11 years of the Nationwide Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies. RESULTS: The epidemiological profiles of leukaemias/lymphomas in Greece are similar to those in industrialised countries. No secular trends are observed for either malignancy during the studied period. However, the calculated incidence for leukaemia (46.60 cases per 1 million children annually) is among the highest in the EU-27 (19% higher than average; p<0.001), whereas that for lymphoma (16.8 cases per 1 million children annually) is around the EU-27 average. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal secular changes in childhood leukaemias/lymphomas have been noted recently in the EU-27, which cannot be easily explained in countries with small populations. Therefore, centralised EU databases such as the Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (ACCIS) should be enlarged to generate sufficient statistical power for monitoring time trends. It would be interesting to explore whether different lifestyle patterns across the EU might be responsible for the observed excess leukaemia incidence in countries such as Greece.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In the 1980s socioeconomic development was dramatically rapid in the urbanized municipalities of Taiwan due to a prospering economy. This study addressed the question: Could differences in the incidence of childhood leukaemia (age <15) be demonstrated between urban and rural communities in Taiwan between 1981 and 1990? METHODS: The log-linear regression model was used to assess the effects of age, level of urbanization, and calendar year on the variation of childhood leukaemia incidence rates between 1981 and 1990. RESULTS: Between 1981 and 1990, the overall incidence rate of childhood leukaemia increased by 20% (rate ratio (RR) = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0-1.5). As compared to rural areas, metropolitan regions showed a significantly higher incidence rate during the study period (RR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6). This urban-rural difference was particularly notable among children <5 years old (RR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.9). Dose-response analysis further indicated that risk of childhood leukaemia was monotonically associated with levels of urbanization. The significant gradient in the risk of childhood leukaemia with urbanization was contributed solely by children in the 0-4 years age group. CONCLUSIONS: We noticed a relationship between urbanization and risk of leukaemia in children. Because of a dramatic influx of people into metropolitan areas during the 1980s, our findings may have provided support for the putative association between 'population mixing' or 'population density' and risk of childhood leukaemia. Whether such association can be attributable to virus infection or other aetiologically related leukemogens warrants further investigations.\n",
      "AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of elderly patients with acute leukaemia receiving chemotherapy. METHOD: Seven elderly patients were interviewed and van Manen approach to data analysis was used in interpreting the participants' interview transcripts. FINDINGS: Three main themes were interpreted from the study participants' narratives: emotions experienced upon diagnosis; the need of support from family, friends, and healthcare professionals; and the importance of information. CONCLUSION: Although some of the findings are similar to those of previous studies examining patients with other cancers, this is the first known study to examine the lived experience of elderly patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. All participants experienced shock and fear at diagnosis. Despite their advancing age, all participants expressed the hope that treatments would provide a good quality of life and, in some cases, even cure. With good support from family, friends and healthcare professionals, participants revealed that they learnt to cope with the diagnosis and its treatments.\n",
      "Environmental factors operating around the time of birth may influence the subsequent development of childhood cancer, particularly leukaemia. Certain factors may vary with season (e.g. infections), and we therefore investigated whether there was any evidence of seasonality of month of birth, based on data from 4199 children diagnosed with cancer under the age of 15 years. We extracted details of (i) children born 1960-95 and diagnosed 1968-95 from two population-based registries, covering the Northern (n = 2053) and Yorkshire (n = 1977) Regional Health Authority and (ii) children born in Cumbria 1950-93 and diagnosed anywhere in the UK before 1994 from a birth cohort database (n = 397). The following diagnostic categories were analysed: 0-14 years--all cancers, leukaemias, acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, central nervous system tumours, all other solid tumours; 1-6 years--leukaemias, acute lymphoblastic leukaemias. Seasonal variation was tested using Walter and Elwood test, and logistic regression analysis allowing for cyclical variation in month of birth. No evidence of seasonality was present for any group except acute lymphoblastic leukaemia diagnosed among 1- to 6-year-olds. Seasonal trends varied by region: in the Northern and Cumbrian datasets, seasonality patterns were significant and similar (P < 0.05) with a predicted peak in early spring, whereas in Yorkshire there was less strong evidence of seasonality (P = 0.08) with a peak predicted in late summer. These findings suggest that local seasonal environmental factors operating around the time of birth are not associated with the totality of childhood cancer, but possible links with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia are supportive of a hypothesis of an infectious aetiology.\n",
      "An epidemiological study of the total population of patients with leukaemia in Poland during the period 1963-90 was performed with special emphasis on time trends. The material stemmed from the Polish National Cancer Registry and was believed to be virtually complete. Of the 38,200 patients, 50% had acute leukaemia, 25% had chronic lymphatic leukaemia, 15% had chronic myeloid leukaemia, and 10% of the patients had undefined lymphatic and myeloid leukaemia. Over the 28-year period, the incidence of leukaemia increased threefold in the age group 70-80+ years, and the increase in the age group 50-69 years was suspected. In the final 11 years of the study acute leukaemia increased in total age groups, mainly among those aged 70-80+ years, whereas the incidence of chronic myeloid leukaemia remained unchanged. The incidence of chronic lymphatic leukaemia increased only in the age group 70-80+ years.\n",
      "We studied 137 cases of acute leukaemia seen between December 1985 and November 1988, using traditional staining techniques together with cytochemistry and in cases of probable acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Sudan Black negative) by immunophenotyping. Not all tests were carried out in every case (some cases of ALL could only be classified as T or non-T). Paediatric group (age less than or equal to 14 yrs): 75 cases--acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 52, acute myeloid leukaemia 18, acute undifferentiated leukaemia 5. Peak incidence in 5-9 year group. Male:Female ratio = 1.7:1. acute myeloid leukaemia was associated with chloromas in 2 cases (11 pc). Adult group: 62 cases--acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 23, acute myeloid leukaemia 36 and acute undifferentiated leukaemia 3. Peak incidence in 50-54 age group. Male:Female ratio = 1:1.2. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia subtypes (all ages) T 16, Common 20, Null 12, 'non-T' 16, B cell 0, untyped 11. 69 pc were of L2 morphology. In T-ALL, 11 had thymomas and Male:Female ratio = 15:1. Male:Female ratio for 'non-T' = 1.5:1. Acute myeloid leukaemia subtypes (all ages) M1 3, M2 8, M3 14, M4 19, M5 8, M6 2, M7 1. Overall incidence of acute leukaemia appears increased at 0.91 per 100,000 per annum from previous studies in Zimbabwe. Common ALL (mean age = 13 years) is an emerging problem and now outnumbers T-ALL (mean age = 10 years). This may be related to a general improvement in living standards and health in Zimbabwe.\n",
      "Recently the p16 and related p15 genes have been described as candidate tumour suppressors at chromosome 9p21. These genes have been found to be homozygously deleted at a high frequency in several types of solid tumours and also in acute lymphoid leukaemias. In order to determine whether these genes are more widely involved in haematological malignancies, we have investigated a total of 84 samples that did not have homozygous p16 or p15 deletions from patients with acute lymphoid leukaemia (n=13), acute myeloid leukaemia (n=24) and chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis (n=43) as well as four haemopoietic cell lines. p15 and p16 exon 1 and exon 2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), analysed by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and subsequently by sequencing. Within the p16 gene, a G-->A polymorphism at nucleotide 436 was found in 3/80 (4%) leukaemias and the cell line HL60. This cell line had also a C-->T mutation at nucleotide 232 which causes a premature stop codon. Analysis of the p15 gene revealed a C-->A mutation within the noncoding sequence 27 nucleotides upstream of exon 2 in 10/80 (13%) cases. These data show that inactivation of either the p15 or p16 gene by point mutation is a very uncommon event in acute leukaemias.\n",
      "Peripheral blood samples from 73 patients with chronic leukaemia were measured with the Technicon H-6000 automated haematology analyser to provide flow cytochemical (peroxidase content) and volume (light scatter) discriminated scattergram patterns. For chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), these patterns were so reproducible and distinct that they allowed an immediate diagnosis even without the benefit of microscopic examination. Relative and absolute basophilia was an invariable feature, and remained detected by the H-6000 even when the patient was in haematologic and cytogenetic remission or progressed into blast crisis (BC). Most patients in BC also demonstrated an inordinately high number of large unstained cells (LUC) and high proportions of 'lymphocytes' (small blasts with no peroxidase content by visual inspection). Thus, for patients with CGL, LUC values above 10%, and/or steady increments in the proportion of 'lymphocytes', merit concern as these changes may herald an accelerated phase of disease. The scattergram pattern of untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) showed a dense accumulation of data points within the lymphocytic 'box' with a small cluster of granulocytic elements. Most patients also had a frankly abnormal proportion of LUC. Sixteen patients with CLL were compared for ratios of LUC to lymphocytes and stage of disease; patients with the most advanced stage (IV) had the highest, statistically significant values, than the patients with more benign disease. Thus, it is possible that follow up with this instrument of patients with CLL will also allow early detection of an impending prolymphocytoid transformation (accelerated phase) of this disease.\n",
      "This paper describes an ecological study investigating whether there is an excess incidence of acute leukaemia among children aged 0-14 years living in the vicinity of the nuclear sites in Belgium. Poisson regression modelling was carried out for proximity areas of varying sizes. In addition, the hypothesis of a gradient in leukaemia incidence with increasing levels of surrogate exposures was explored by means of focused hypothesis tests and generalized additive models. For the surrogate exposures, three proxies were used, that is, residential proximity to the nuclear site, prevailing winds and simulated radioactive discharges, on the basis of mathematical dispersion modelling. No excess incidence of acute leukaemia was observed around the nuclear power plants of Doel or Tihange nor around the nuclear site of Fleurus, which is a major manufacturer of radioactive isotopes in Europe. Around the site of Mol-Dessel, however, two- to three-fold increased leukaemia incidence rates were found in children aged 0-14 years living in the 0-5, 0-10 and the 0-15 km proximity areas. For this site, there was evidence for a gradient in leukaemia incidence with increased proximity, prevailing winds and simulated radioactive discharges, suggesting a potential link with the site that needs further investigation. An increased incidence of acute leukaemia in children aged 0-14 years was observed around one nuclear site that hosted reprocessing activities in the past and where nuclear research activities and radioactive waste treatment are ongoing.\n",
      "An eight-year-old entire female boxer was presented with a two-week history of anorexia and lethargy and two-day history of unilateral left epistaxis. Clinical findings and laboratory test results suggested disseminated intravascular coagulation. On blood smear evaluation, occasional large epithelioid-like unclassified cells were detected. Occasionally these cells were organised in small clusters. Bone marrow examination revealed a marked infiltration by a malignant population of the same epithelioid-like cells. The dog was euthanased because of the guarded prognosis. Following histology and immunohistochemistry, a widespread undifferentiated carcinoma of unknown primary origin was diagnosed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of carcinoma cell leukaemia reported in a dog. Carcinoma cell leukaemia is a rare oncological condition previously described in humans, characterised by non-haematopoietic neoplastic cells in peripheral blood.\n",
      "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulated H-thymidine incorporation in the blasts of six of 21 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). An IL-2 induced increase in cell numbers was directly demonstrated in the two patients studied in this way, and T-cell contamination was rigorously excluded. The IL-2-induced proliferation was usually less marked than that caused by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IL-2 moderately enhanced GM-CSF-induced stimulation in five of the six patients; in the sixth, IL-2 and GM-CSF were strongly synergistic. IL-2-induced proliferation was observed only in AML with a monocytic component (M4/M5), but not all M4/M5 leukaemias responded to IL-2. There was no correlation between expression of the light-chain of the IL-2 receptor and IL-2-induced stimulation. It is suggested that IL-2 is involved at a restricted stage of early myelopoiesis, perhaps when cells are becoming committed to the monocytic lineage; and that IL-2 is a growth factor for early myeloid cells in a proportion of cases of AML.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Leukaemia is a heterogeneous disease in which haematopoietic progenitor cells acquire genetic lesions that lead to a block in differentiation, increased self-renewal, and unregulated proliferation. The enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), involved in folate metabolism, plays a crucial role in cells because folate availability is important for DNA integrity. The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate the association of the C677T MTHFR gene polymorphism with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 275 leukaemia cases - including AML (n = 112), ALL (n = 81), CML (n = 43), CLL (n = 39) - and 251 age/sex-matched healthy control individuals participated in this study. MTHFR C677T polymorphisms in the cases and controls were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The average MTHFR 677CC, 677CT, 677TT genotype frequencies of total leukaemia cases were 68.73%, 19.64%, and 11.64% in cases, and 71.71%, 24.30%, and 3.98% in healthy controls, respectively. The average frequency of the MTHFR 677T allele was 21.45% among the cases compared to 16.13% among the controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the present case-control study we have observed a higher frequency of the MTHFR 677TT genotype in cases of leukaemia (AML, ALL, CML and CLL) as compared with controls; this might be due to ethnic and geographic variation. As per our findings, although the frequency of the MTHFR 677T allele is moderately high in AML, ALL and CLL, no statistically significant association was found; on the other hand statistically significant association was found in the context of CML cases.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Childhood leukaemia accounts for more than 40% of new childhood cancer cases. Karyotyping of cytogenetic abnormalities in such cases continues to provide critical prognostic information which allows the delivery of an appropriate intensity of treatment. Unfortunately, karyotyping of childhood leukaemia is difficult, laborious and often unsuccessful. Banding resolution tends to be poor unlike routine antenatal cytogenetics. The aim of the study is to highlight the benefit of dedicated cytogenetics in improving karyotyping results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the impact of setting up a team of cytogeneticists in the National University Hospital (NUH) on the success of karyotyping, evaluating cytogenetic data collected from 1989 to 2006. From 1989 to 2006, 4789 cases have been processed. Among them, 369 newly diagnosed and relapsed childhood acute leukaemia cases [281 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 88 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)] have been diagnosed at NUH. A dedicated cytogenetics laboratory with clearly defined standard operating procedures and quality control was set up in 2002. It used the established recommendation of a complete analysis of at least 20 metaphases per analysis. RESULTS: Overall, the frequency of successful karyotyping was significantly higher (P = 0.002) at 90.7% (185/204) from 2002-2006 compared to 79.4% (131/165) from 1989-2001. For ALL cases, the success rate improved from 77.6% (97/125) in 1989 to 2001 to 89.1% (139/156) in the 2002 to 2006 cohort. For AML, the success rate also was significantly improved (P = 0.04) from 85% (34/40) to 95.8% (46/48). Significantly, this high rate of success is still maintained despite a yearly increase in volume. CONCLUSION: The establishment of a dedicated cytogenetics service leads to an improvement in results.\n",
      "The major research themes in poikilotherm leukaemias, and their progress over the past two years are reviewed. Despite the fact that poikilotherms represent 99% of the animal world including man, background knowledge on most poikilotherm species is sparse. Furthermore, haemic systems in many poikilotherms have functions different to those of homeotherms. Most progress is being made in relation to lethal blood mutant neoplasms in Drosophila, leukaemias of farmed salmonids among the fishes, and among shellfish, the hemic sarcomas of bivalves. The hypothesis that epizootic neoplasia in fish and shellfish populations could be indicative of environmental pollution is being refined in the light of recent studies; environmental xenobiotics are no longer considered to play a primary aetiological role in either lymphomas and leukaemias of fish or haemic sarcomas of bivalves, although xenobiotics may have a primary role in other poikilotherm neoplasms.\n",
      "The Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) has run a population-based registry on all cases of acute leukaemias in the Nordic countries since 1981. Data on close to 2000 children with these diagnoses are presented and used as a background for a general discussion of progress in the therapy of these challenging conditions. Our material is unique in that it is population based. The results obtained are comparable to those obtained by all other major cooperative groups. Since January 1992, the treatment protocols for all types of acute leukaemias in childhood have been harmonized in the Nordic countries.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a group of malignant diseases of the haematopoietic system. AML occurs as the result of mutations in haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which upregulate Wnt signalling through a variety of mechanisms. Other mechanisms of Wnt activation in AML have been described such as Wnt antagonist inactivation through promoter methylation. Wnt signalling is necessary for the maintenance of leukaemic stem cells. Several molecules involved in or modulating Wnt signalling have a prognostic value in AML. These include: β-catenin, LEF-1, phosphorylated-GSK3β, PSMD2, PPARD, XPNPEP, sFRP2, RUNX1, AXIN2, PCDH17, CXXC5, LLGL1 and PTK7. Targeting Wnt signalling for tumour eradication is an approach that is being explored in haematological and solid tumours. A number of preclinical studies confirms its feasibility, albeit, so far no reliable clinical trial data are available to prove its utility and efficacy.\n",
      "It is essential in occupational case-control studies of rare diseases for ascertainment to be as complete as possible, together with an accurately defined diagnosis. A nested case-control study from a large cohort of UK oil distribution workers followed up since 1950 was carried out to investigate the association between leukaemia, in particular acute myeloid leukaemia, and exposure to benzene. Ninety-one cases occurring before 1993 were identified from death certificates or cancer registrations (available from 1971). Histopathology departments were contacted to obtain material that might confirm the diagnosis of leukaemia and this was received for 39 (43%) cases. The majority of the cases (88) were identified primarily from death certificates, with a cancer registration also being received for 56 (90%) of the 62 deaths occurring after 1971. Discrepancies in the diagnoses from these two sources were found for 12 cases, five being acute myeloid leukaemia. For the majority, the diagnosis on the death certificate was more specific than that on the cancer registration. Histology reports were received for nine of the discrepancies, all confirming the death certificate diagnosis. Although leukaemia appears to be regularly registered as a cancer, records may not be routinely updated when new clinical information becomes available. It is recommended that death certificates, cancer registrations and histology reports are obtained routinely by cancer registries to maximize both numbers of cases and diagnostic accuracy for epidemiological studies.\n",
      "A population-based case-control study on risk factors for childhood malignancies was used to investigate a previously reported association between elevated indoor radon concentrations and childhood cancer, with special regard to leukaemia. The patients were all children suffering from leukaemia and common solid tumours (nephroblastoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumours) diagnosed between July 1988 and June 1993 in Lower Saxony (Germany) and aged less than 15 years. Two population-based control groups were matched by age and gender to the leukaemia patients. Long-term (1 year) radon measurements were performed in those homes where the children had been living for at least 1 year, with particular attention being paid to those rooms where they had stayed most of the time. Due to the sequential study design, radon measurements in these rooms could only be done for 36% (82 leukaemias, 82 solid tumours and 209 controls) of the 1038 families initially contacted. Overall mean indoor radon concentrations (27 Bq m(-3)) were low compared with the measured levels in other studies. Using a prespecified cutpoint of 70 Bq m(-3), no association with indoor radon concentrations was seen for the leukaemias (odds ratio (OR): 1.30; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.32-5.33); however, the risk estimates were elevated for the solid tumours (OR: 2.61; 95% CI: 0.96-7.13), mainly based on 6 CNS tumours. We did not find any evidence for an association between indoor radon and childhood leukaemia, which is in line with a recently published American case-control study. There is little support for an association with CNS tumours in the literature.\n",
      "Thirty-five years ago, bone marrow transplantation was first being explored as a last-ditch effort to treat patients with end stage leukaemia. Through the efforts of a large number of laboratory and clinical scientists, the application of transplantation has broadened and outcomes have dramatically improved. The science of transplantation continues to attract a great deal of research, and with this effort we can expect continued progress and patient benefit.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a group of haematological malignant disorders. Although not a new disease, many studies have been conducted to explore AML etiology, pathogenesis and prognosis at molecular level over the past two decades. A meticulous and continuous review of the available literature is still required to contemplate currently discovered information. We searched Google Scholar and PubMed by using different key word such as: updates in diagnostic criteria of AML, WHO classification of AML, new prognostic factors and risk stratification of AML. Mostly articles are referred from international sources published during last five years. Some older articles were only used when pivotal information required could not be surpassed by newer articles. Initially 50 relevant articles were included which were subsequently reduced to 36 by excluding articles with similar information. In this review an attempt is made to approach the subject in the light of currently available literature.\n",
      "Tawam Hospital is the major paediatric oncology referral centre in the UAE. During the past 11 years, 352 patients (0-12 years of age) were diagnosed to have a childhood malignancy. Leukaemia and lymphoma accounted for 62.7% of all tumours. Stage distribution for Hodgkin disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) showed a relatively high proportion of advanced stage disease. Histological analysis demonstrated a preponderance of lymphocyte predominance and mixed cellularity cases in Hodgkin disease, and 2/3 of the NHL patients had small, non-cleaved cell lymphoma. Children fell into three main ethnic groups based on the origin/nationality of their parents: Group 1: UAE nationals and Omanis; Group 2: other Arabs; Group 3: Indian/Pakistani (subcontinental) origin. When compared for the relative proportion of leukaemia/lymphoma/other tumours, children of subcontinental origin had significantly more acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and less lymphoma than the other two ethnic groups. This is probably due to the higher level of education and smaller family size in group 3 and lends support to the proposed infectious aetiology in ALL.\n",
      "Immunophenotypic studies using immunofluorescent flow cytometry were performed on the blast cells of 36 patients with acute leukaemia using a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies. Six patients had blasts which co-expressed markers for lymphoid and myeloid differentiation, and which were therefore defined as biphenotypic hybrid acute leukaemia. Of the six, three patients were in the paediatric age group (below 12 years old) while the other three were more than 12 years old. Peripheral blood counts were variable; however, bone marrow infiltration was extensive (blasts > or = 75% in all). At the time of study, remission was achieved in only two patients. The authors' data show that biphenotypic hybrid acute leukaemia is not rare in Malaysia. This represents a subgroup of acute leukaemia identifiable by immunophenotyping but not by the French-American-British classification based on morphological and basic cytochemical studies alone. The recognition of this subgroup is important for both practical and theoretical reasons. There are implications for treatment of the individual patient because treatment directed at a single lineage may not be effective. The two colour flow cytometry proved to be a useful tool for diagnosis and classification of acute leukaemia.\n",
      "With optimum treatment 65-70% of children diagnosed with cancer should be long term survivors and probably cured. Prevention is better than cure. Recent studies into the causes of childhood malignancy are reviewed. The incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is steadily increasing. The cause for this may be increasing social and economic development. Exposure to electromagnetic fields has been a cause of concern for almost 20 years. A recent large case control study has shown no increased risk of cancer or leukaemia in those who have measurably increased exposure to electromagnetic fields. Leukaemia which has the cytogenetic abnormality 11q23 or MLL gene rearrangement characteristically occurs as a second malignancy after exposure to epipodophyllotoxins which act by inhibiting topoisomerase. Infant leukaemia has the same cytogenetic profile. Mothers of babies who develop infant leukaemia have high exposure to potential dietary inhibitors of topoisomerase during pregnancy. Clusters of leukaemia can probably best be accounted for by population mixing. There may be an increased risk of ALL following vitamin K given to newborns.\n",
      "Increases of leukaemia in young people that cannot be explained in terms of radiation have been recorded near both of Britain nuclear reprocessing plants at Dounreay and Sellafield. These were built in unusually isolated places where herd immunity to a postulated widespread virus infection (to which leukaemia is a rare response) would tend to be lower than average. The large influxes of people in the 1950s to those areas might have been conducive to epidemics. The hypothesis has been tested in Scotland in an area identified at the outset as the only other rural area that received a large influx at the same time, when it was much more cut off from the nearest conurbation than at present--the New Town of Glenrothes. A significant increase of leukaemia below age 25 was found (10 observed, expected 3.6), with a greater excess below age 5 (7 observed, expected 1.5).\n",
      "Despite the major role of the AKT/PKB family of proteins in the regulation of many growth and survival mechanisms in the cell, and the increasing evidence suggesting that AKT disruption could play a key role in many human malignancies, no major mutations of AKT genes had been reported, until very recently when Carpten et al reported a novel transforming mutation (E17K) in the pleckstrin homology domain of the AKT1 gene in solid tumours. Several laboratories are now screening for this mutation in different malignancies, and, recently, the mutation was described by Malanga et al in 1.9% of lung cancer patients. Considering the importance of the PI3K/AKT pathway in mediating survival and antiapoptotic signals in the B-cell types of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), we sequenced the AKT1 exon 3 for the above mentioned mutation in 87 specimens, representing 45 CLLs, 38 ALLs and 4 prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) cases, which are all of B-cell origin. Our results show that the mutation E17K/AKT1 was not detected in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1 of the investigated cases. We conclude that this mutation is not a major event in B-cell-derived lymphoid leukaemias.\n",
      "Myeloid Sarcomas are rare tumours of myeloid origin that may infiltrate multiple sites of the body. They may precede acute myeloid leukaemia or present without it. It has non-specific manifestations and presents as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge owing to the limited literature that reports consensus on diagnostic and treatment strategies. Immunohistochemistry is of significance in identifying the disease and acute myeloid leukaemia protocols of systemic therapy remain the mainstay of the treatment. Our report of an 11-year-old child with myeloid sarcoma aims to add to the limited existing literature and describe the varied presentation and sites of involvement.\n",
      "The presence of oestrogen receptors (ER) and type II oestrogen binding sites (type II EBS) have been investigated by a whole cell assay in seven cases of acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) and 16 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). ER were detected in 6/7 ALL patients with values ranging between 133 and 2268 sites/cell and in 12/16 AML patients with values ranging between 274 and 4197 sites/cell. The apparent dissociation constant (KD) for ER was 0.6 +/- 0.3 nM (mean + SD of 20 cases). All blasts from ALL and AML patients expressed type II EBS at variable levels ranging between 3109 and 239450 sites/cell. The mean KD value for these sites was 18.3 +/- 5.6 nM (mean +/- SD of 23 cases). Specificity experiments demonstrated that type II EBS are oestrogen specific relative to the class of steroid hormones. In addition, the flavonol quercetin was able to compete for [3H]17 beta-oestradiol (E2) binding to type II EBS, the relative binding affinity (RBA) of quercetin being greater than that of diethylstillboestrol (DES). DES and quercetin exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of ALL and AML blast proliferation in the range of concentrations between 10(-8) and 10(-5) M. The RBA of DES and quercetin for type II EBS correlated well with their potency as cell growth inhibitors. Moreover, the flavonols rutin and hesperidin which compete slightly for [3H]E2 binding to type II EBS, were scarcely effective in inhibiting leukaemic cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect of DES and quercetin was not due to a non-specific cytotoxic action since after a 1 d culture period, cell viability did not vary between control and treated cells, being greater than 80%. Our results suggest that high oestrogen concentrations and the flavonol quercetin may inhibit leukaemic blast proliferation through a common mechanism involving a binding interaction with type II EBS.\n",
      "Human natural killer (NK) cells are potent effectors involved in destruction of virus infected cells and tumours. Their cytolytic function is regulated by surface receptors that either inhibit or increase the NK-mediated cytotoxicity. Under physiological conditions, NK cells recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class I molecules through surface receptors delivering signals that inhibit NK cells function. Nonetheless, the \"missing self hypothesis\", i.e. the release of an inhibitory signal by the interaction between HLA I-specific inhibitory receptors and their ligands, is not sufficient to entirely explain the regulation of NK cytotoxicity. Activating and co-receptors also play a central role in NK cell activation. In the haematology field, several lines of evidence suggest that NKs participate to the anti-leukaemia immune response: (1) leukaemic cells have down-regulated HLA-class I molecule expression and putative allele loss, (2) several reports have indicated an inverse relationship between NK cell number or activity and prognosis in acute leukaemia, (3) NK-cell activity dependent immunodeficiency syndromes are associated with an increased frequency of lymphoid haematological malignancies, (4) recent data support a role for NK cells in the graft-versus-leukaemia effect observed in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. All these data raise several questions. How NK cells kill leukaemic targets, and how can leukaemia escape from innate immunity surveillance? What are the therapeutic possibilities to manipulate NK receptor-ligand interaction in order to increase leukaemia cell destruction? The responses to these questions will contribute to immunotherapy advancements in leukaemia and more generally in cancer.\n",
      "A series of 256 bone marrow biopsy specimens was obtained at different times from a group of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic granulocytic leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and was analysed in parallel with peripheral blood smears and bone marrow aspirate samples. In five of these biopsy specimens the bone marrow lesion was discrete, deeply seated within the marrow cavity and detected only in long-core biopsies. Neither peripheral blood nor bone marrow aspirates obtained at the same time established the correct diagnosis. This suggests that when peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate samples fail to indicate the diagnosis a long-core biopsy may yield positive results.\n",
      "Over the last two decades residential exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF MF) has been associated with childhood leukaemia relatively consistently in epidemiological studies, though causality is still under investigation. We aimed to estimate the cases of childhood leukaemia that might be attributable to exposure to ELF MF in the European Union (EU27), if the associations seen in epidemiological studies were causal. We estimated distributions of ELF MF exposure using studies identified in the existing literature. Individual distributions of exposure were integrated using a probabilistic mixture distribution approach. Exposure-response functions were estimated from the most recently published pooled analysis of epidemiological data. Probabilistic simulation was used to estimate population attributable fractions (AFP) and attributable cases of childhood leukaemia in the EU27. By assigning the literature review-based exposure distribution to all EU27 countries, we estimated the total annual number of cases of leukaemia attributable to ELF MF at between ~50 (95% CIs: -14, 132) and ~60 (95% CIs: -9, 610), depending on whether exposure-response was modelled categorically or continuously, respectively, for a non-threshold effect. This corresponds to between ~1.5% and ~2.0% of all incident cases of childhood leukaemia occurring annually in the EU27. Considerable uncertainties are due to scarce data on exposure and the choice of exposure-response model, demonstrating the importance of further research into better understanding mechanisms of the potential association between ELF MF exposure and childhood leukaemia and the need for improved monitoring of residential exposures to ELF MF in Europe.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Acute leukemia and hospitalization for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) are the great psychological stressors. The aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression associated with such conditions and their psychophysical predictors before and after HCT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study using self-descriptive tools. The questionnaires: LOT-R, AIS, Mini-Mac, CECS, RSCL and HADS were filled by 60 patients with acute leukaemia before and after HCT. RESULTS: Anxiety and depressive symptoms correlated positively with psychological symptom distress. The correlation with depressive symptoms was weak, however, with anxious symptoms was moderate. In both cases, the higher was a level of psychological symptom distress, the higher level of anxiety and depression was observed in patients. The results indicated the weak, positive correlation between onerousness of physical symptoms and a level of anxiety. The greater was the severity of physical symptoms, the higher was the level of anxiety. The negative predictor of anxious symptoms was control of anxiety but it was weakly associated with a lower level of the explained variable. The negative predictor of anxious symptoms was also dispositional optimism whose high level accompanied the lower severity of the explained variable. However, the positive predictor of anxious symptoms was the variable of onerousness of symptoms whose high level accompanied the higher severity of anxious symptoms in the examined group CONCLUSION: Patients with acute leukemia who are hospitalized for HCT require detailed monitoring of their psychological distress to introduce the proper psychological and pharmacological interventions that reduce anxiety as well as boost \"dispositional optimism\" and mechanisms of control.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk factors for leukaemic transformation and myeloid leukaemia in patients with SLE. METHODS: A national SLE cohort identified through SLE discharge diagnoses in the Swedish hospital discharge register during 1964 to 1995 (n = 6438) was linked to the national cancer register. A nested case-control study in SLE patients who developed acute or chronic myeloid leukaemia was performed with SLE patients without malignancy as controls. Medical records from cases and controls were reviewed and bone marrow specimens were re-evaluated. A Medline search of previously published cases of SLE and myeloid leukaemia was performed. RESULTS: After confirmation of SLE diagnosis according to the ACR criteria, eight patients with SLE and myeloid leukaemia and 18 SLE controls were included in the study. Preceding leucopenia was significantly associated with leukaemia development, whereas other SLE manifestations were not. Two cases had a preceding bone marrow confirming myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Only two cases were significantly treated with cyclophosphamide or AZA. A Medline search resulted in only 15 previously published cases of coincident SLE and myeloid leukaemia. Preceding MDS was reported in five of these, whereas only eight had been treated with cytotoxic drugs. CONCLUSION: Low-dose chemotherapy was not a major cause of myeloid malignancy in our population-based cohort of SLE patients nor in the reported cases from literature. Leucopenia was a risk factor for myeloid leukaemia development and an MDS was frequently seen. Therefore bone marrow investigation should be considered in SLE patients with long-standing leucopenia and anaemia.\n",
      "The nature of the cells in 21 cases of acute leukaemia with blasts which were undifferentiated by light microscopy criteria was investigated by immunophenotyping, ultrastructural cytochemistry and DNA analysis. Two groups of cases were recognized. Fourteen cases were negative with B and T lymphoid markers and expressed one or two myeloid antigens detected by the monoclonal antibodies (McAb) MCS2 (CD13) and MY9 (CD33). Peroxidase activity was demonstrated at ultrastructural level by the method of Roels on unfixed cells in eight out of 10 cases; rearrangement of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes was demonstrated in one of the three cases investigated. These cases are proliferations of early, MO, myeloblasts which can only be recognized by immunological and ultrastructural cytochemical methods. The remaining seven cases revealed a complex phenotype with expression of myeloid and lymphoid antigens. Peroxidase activity was detected in blasts from two cases with rearrangement of the Ig-heavy chain gene; in one of them the T cell receptor beta and gamma chain genes were also found in rearranged configuration. This group comprises cases of biphenotypic and mixed acute leukaemia which probably involve multipotent stem cells. This study demonstrates that the expression of myeloid antigens on blast cells parallels closely the presence of peroxidase activity and that lymphoid markers correlate with gene rearrangements at DNA level. Our findings are reassuring with respect to the specificity of the antimyeloid McAb for the diagnosis of cases which are unclassifiable by conventional methods.\n",
      "To detect the minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute promyelocytic leukaemia patients treated with all-trans retinoic acid, we compared the sensitivity of metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with conventional analysis of G-banded metaphases. 5 out of 6 patients studied at diagnosis showed the t(15;17) translocation. 4 out of 5 patients carrying t(15;17) achieved complete remission and conventional cytogenetic conversion. In 3 cases the whole chromosome painting (WCP) probe 17 discovered one normal chromosome 17 and two fragments indicative of t(15;17) persistence. The FISH-WCP technique seems to be highly sensitive and recommendable in monitoring leukaemias with specific chromosome rearrangements.\n",
      "The use of animal models has revealed important mechanisms relevant to the development and treatment of human cancer. In recent years the zebrafish has emerged as an exciting new organism in which to model leukaemogenesis. The zebrafish model has distinct advantages over other animal models, most notably a capacity for forward genetic studies and rapid small molecule screens which can be used to dissect novel genetic pathways contributing to the development of leukaemia. Additionally, the high fecundity and optical clarity of the zebrafish make it an attractive organism in which to directly visualize the localization and development of normal and abnormal haematopoiesis in vivo. Until recently, targeting mutations to specific genes was technically difficult in the zebrafish, but new technology using chimeric zinc fingers to create targeted gene knockouts has made reverse genetic modelling possible and promises to deliver many new and exciting models. This review summarizes the benefits of using the zebrafish to study leukaemogenesis, reviews current zebrafish models of specific leukaemias, and gives an overview of future direction for the zebrafish in the study of cancer.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis of an association between neonatal intramuscular vitamin K and childhood leukaemia and other cancers. DESIGN: Population based case-control study with data abstracted from hospital records. SETTING: Scotland. SUBJECTS: Children aged 0-14 years resident in Scotland from 1991-4 and diagnosed with leukaemia (150), lymphomas (46), central nervous system tumours (79), a range of other solid tumours (142), and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (129). Controls were 777 children matched for age and sex, providing 417 matched sets (360 triplets and 57 pairs) for analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Odds ratios for the risk of childhood leukaemia and cancer and intramuscular vitamin K versus a combined group of oral doses, none, and no record. Results are given for information recorded in medical notes and data supplemented by hospital policy. RESULTS: Odds ratios based on medical record abstractions showed no significant positive association for leukaemias (odds ratio 1.30; 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 2.03), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (1.21; 0.74 to 1.97), lymphomas (1.06; 0.46 to 2.42), central nervous system tumours (0.74; 0.40 to 1.34), and other solid tumours (0.59; 0.37 to 0.96). There was no association with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children aged 1 to 6 years. Imputation of exposure from hospital policy gave similar results. Adjustment for deprivation and type of delivery moved risk estimates closer to unity for all major diagnostic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The observation of an increased risk of childhood leukaemia and cancer associated with intramuscular vitamin K is not confirmed by this independent population based study.\n",
      "Acute leukaemias have traditionally been classified according to the nature of the predominating cells as judged by cytomorphology and cytochemistry. A codification of this classification into M1-M7 for myeloid cases (AML), proposed by the FAB group of haematologists, has been used extensively in the past decade. Some criticisms of this codification are presented and other approaches to classification are discussed. Among these are included the potential importance of multiple lineage expression, measurements of cell differentiation using cytochemical criteria, surface antigenic differences as demonstrated by the use of monoclonal antibodies and the growing contribution of cytogenetics. A simplified classification into broad groups is proposed. These groups may be further elaborated as appropriate.\n",
      "The authors, on the basis of a review of the literature and on their personal experience, derived from the observation of 169 cases of acute and chronic leukaemias, describe the different aspects of the cutaneous lesions present during the course of these neoplastic conditions. The cutaneous lesions, subdivided according to the type of leukaemia, show an extremely variable pattern and it is therefore difficult to differentiate on the basis of the sole macroscopic appearances, specific leukaemic nodules or infiltrates from dermatoses due to bacterial, viral and fungal infections on which an haemorrhagic component may be superimposed. Similarly, if a clearly established diagnosis of leukaemia has not been confirmed, it is difficult to distinguish leukaemic infiltrates from cutaneous lesions caused by a malignant lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, an eosinophilic granuloma, or from benign lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, secondary to cutaneous infections. It is important also to bear in mind the development of skin eruptions, often with an haemorrhagic component, due to acquired sensitivity to numerous agents, cytostatic drugs, antibiotics, blood products and others, used in therapy. The authors therefore underline the importance of an early recognition of an infectious lesion, often complicated by a previous haemorrhagic event or secondary to microbial invasion of a catheter tip or of a venipuncture site, and consequently, the authors emphasize the need to distinguish these non-specific skin alterations, amenable to appropriate treatment from those lesions due to the development of a skin tumour or to a leukaemic infiltrate, which is nearly always indicative of a leukaemia recurrence or extension of the leukaemic process.\n",
      "Advances in sequencing technologies are giving unprecedented insights into the spectrum of somatic mutations underlying acute myeloid leukaemia with a normal karyotype (AML-NK). It is clear that the prognosis of individual patients is strongly influenced by the combination of mutations in their leukaemia and that many leukaemias are composed of multiple subclones, with differential susceptibilities to treatment. Here, we describe a method, employing targeted capture coupled with next-generation sequencing and tailored bioinformatic analysis, for the simultaneous study of 24 genes recurrently mutated in AML-NK. Mutational analysis was performed using open source software and an in-house script (Mutation Identification and Analysis Software), which identified dominant clone mutations with 100% specificity. In each of seven cases of AML-NK studied, we identified and verified mutations in 2-4 genes in the main leukaemic clone. Additionally, high sequencing depth enabled us to identify putative subclonal mutations and detect leukaemia-specific mutations in DNA from remission marrow. Finally, we used normalised read depths to detect copy number changes and identified and subsequently verified a tandem duplication of exons 2-9 of MLL and at least one deletion involving PTEN. This methodology reliably detects sequence and copy number mutations, and can thus greatly facilitate the classification, clinical research, diagnosis and management of AML-NK.\n",
      "Chromosomal translocations involving the Mixed-Lineage Leukaemia (MLL) gene underlie many human leukaemias and MLL rearrangements are found in both acute myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukaemias. To assess the functionally relevant haematopoietic cell contexts for MLL fusions to be tumorigenic, we have generated different lines of mice in which de novo Mll-associated translocations occur. In these models, reciprocal chromosomal translocations occur by means of Cre-loxP-mediated recombination (translocator mice) in different cells of the haematopoietic system (namely haematopoietic stem cells, semi-committed progenitors or committed T or B cells). Translocations between Mll and Enl cause myeloid neoplasias, initiating in stem cells or progenitors while no tumours arose when the translocation was restricted to the B-cell compartment. Despite the absence of tumorigenesis, Mll-Enl translocations did occur and Mll-Enl fusion mRNA was expressed in B-cell-restricted translocators. A permissive cellular environment is therefore required for oncogenicity of Mll-associated translocations since the occurrence of Mll-Enl does not promote unrestricted proliferation in all haematopoietic cellular contexts, consistent with a specific instructive role of the MLL-fusion proteins in leukaemogenesis.\n",
      "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine incidence of the following malignancies, testicular tumours, all leukaemias and all lymphomas in the West of Ireland in an 11 year period. Secondly, to examine the relation between disease patterns and available occupational data in male subjects of working age. DESIGN: A census survey of all cases occurring in the three counties in the Western Health Board (WHB) area, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, for the 11 year period 1980 to 1990 inclusive. Average annual age standardised incidence rates for the period were calculated using the 1986 census data. Rates for the area are compared with rates from the southern region of Ireland, which had a tumour registry. Trends over the time period are evaluated. All male subjects for whom occupational data were available were categorised using the Irish socioeconomic group classification and incidence rates by occupation were compared using the standardised incidence ratio method. In one of the counties, Galway, a detailed occupational history of selected cases and an age matched control group was also elicited through patients' general practitioners. SETTING: All available case records in the West of Ireland. RESULTS: There are no national incidence records for the period. Compared with data from the Southern Tumour Registry, the number of cases of women with myeloid leukaemias was significantly lower. Male leukaemia rates were significantly lower as a group (SIR 84 (95% CI 74, 95) but not when considered as individual categories. Regression analysis revealed an increasing trend in the number of new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma among both men (r = 0.47, p = 0.02) and women (r = 0.90, p = 0.0001) and of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in men (r = 0.77, p = 0.005) and women (r = 0.68 p = 0.02) in the WHB region over the last decade. Four hundred and fifty six male cases over the age of 15 years were identified and adequate occupational information was available for 74% of these. Standardised incidence ratios of testicular tumours 100, 938) and agriworkers other than farmers (SIR 377, 95% CI 103, 967). There were also significantly increased incidence ratios for both non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR 169, 95% CI 124, 266) and three categories of leukaemias among farmers. Hodgkin disease and acute myeloid leukaemias were significantly increased among semi-skilled people. Interview data with 90 cases and 54 controls of both sexes revealed that among farmers, cases (n = 31) were significantly less likely than controls (n = 20) to use tractor mounted spraying techniques (OR = 0.19 (95% CI 0.04, 0.80)) and less likely to wear protective masks (OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.05, 0.84)). CONCLUSIONS: Trends of increase in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and some leukaemias are consistent with studies elsewhere. The study provides further evidence of the relation between agricultural work and certain lymphoproliferative cancers. The possible carcinogenic role of chemicals used in agricultural industries must be considered as an explanation.\n",
      "The prognosis between subgroups of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) may range considerably. Haematological, genetic and clinical analysis has provided possibilities for defining the heterogeneity of prognosis. This furnishes clinically relevant insights into the probability of treatment response and survival in individual cases of AML and it provides a lead in treatment management.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Lengthy remission or cure has remained elusive for patients with many of the common haematological malignancies. Thus high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation is being increasingly utilised in these diseases. AIM: To assess the safety of high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in haematological malignancy. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with haematological malignancy were given high dose chemotherapy followed by an infusion of previously cryopreserved autologous peripheral blood stem cells with (patients with acute myeloid leukaemia [AML]) or without (patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [ALL], chronic myeloid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin disease and myeloma) autologous bone marrow. RESULTS: All patients except one had sustained engraftment. The median (range) number of days to attain a neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 12 (10-42) and a platelet count of 20 x 10(9)/L unsupported by platelet transfusions was 15 (eight to 155). Other than oropharyngeal mucositis and febrile neutropenia, morbidity was low. Two patients had haemorrhagic cystitis, one hepatic veno-occlusive disease and one interstitial pneumonitis; all resolved. The treatment-related mortality was 2%--a single patient with AML died of failure of sustained engraftment. CONCLUSIONS: Autologous blood stem cell transplantation to support high dose chemotherapy is a relatively safe procedure and its efficacy is currently being explored in a wide range of haematological malignancies.\n",
      "One hundred and six patients with standard risk leukaemia were given fractionated TBI prior to allogeneic (72 cases, 27 of whom were T-depleted) or autologous (34 cases) bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Disease free survival at 5 years is 68% for allogeneic non T-depleted BMT and 33% for T-depleted BMT. Deaths are related to relapse, GVHD, infections, pneumonitis, encephalitis, VOD, AIDS, rejection.\n",
      "When two or more persons, e.g. nurses and patients, act together interaction takes place. The expectations of nurses and their definition of the patient illness status affect their behaviour towards the patient and how they practice nursing. The aim of this study was to examine the interaction between adults with leukaemia and their nurses and how this interaction affected the individual. Grounded theory method guided the data collection and analysis. Four adults with leukaemia and their nursing staff were observed for 124 h in a haematological ward. The core category emerging from the data was transition--the individual passing from one phase to another. This denotes a change in role relations, in expectations and in abilities. The individual makes their transition in three stages. First, the person seeks out information in the corridors and at the same time tries to maintain social status. Next, the patient accepts the disease in the confines of their room and feels insecure in a totally new situation and role. Finally, the leukaemia patient isolates themselves within the confines of the bed, and becomes aware of the leukaemia and its side-effects.\n",
      "Developments in supportive care, new regimens for induction of remission and consolidation therapy, and bone-marrow transplantation have improved the outlook for patients with acute leukaemia. The outlook, though, is influenced by age and factors related to the biology of the disease. In acute myeloid leukaemia age is such an important factor that it determines approach to therapy. Overcoming resistance to chemotherapy is an area that needs much attention.\n",
      "Acute leukaemia (AL) is a bone marrow malignancy of hematopoietic progenitors that historically is poorly responsive to treatment. With the widespread adoption of dose-intense chemotherapy, more human patients attain long-term survivals, but whether comparable progress has been made in canine AL is unknown. To investigate this question, medical records from three academic veterinary hospitals were reviewed. Fifty dogs met the criteria for AL, having excess circulating or marrow blasts, a major cytopenia(s), and no substantial lymphadenopathy. Thirty-six dogs received cytotoxic chemotherapy; 23 achieved a complete or partial response for a median of 56 days (range, 9-218). With failure or relapse, 14 dogs were rescued. Median survival with treatment was poor at 55 days (range, 1-300). Untreated (n = 6) and palliatively-treated (n = 8) dogs lived a median of 7.5 days. Most dogs developed chemoresistance within weeks of initiating treatment, and consequently, survival times for AL remain disappointingly short.\n",
      "The simultaneous occurrence of two specific acquired chromosomal abnormalities in chronic or acute leukaemias is rare. Inherited chromosomal abnormalities are also rare events in the general population. In chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), characterised by the t(9;22)(q34;q11), the inv(16)(p13q22) has been described associated with the acceleration of disease or onset of blast crisis. We report on a patient with chronic phase of CML and both acquired t(9;22)(q34;q11) and inherited inv(16)(p13q22), who obtained a complete remission of the disease after bone marrow transplant. Therefore, it is worth to comment that an additional chromosomal abnormality in disease does not obligatory mean transformation of the disease to a more aggressive form, since chromosomal abnormalities are also seen in normal individuals.\n",
      "Epidural sacral nerve compression as an initial feature of leukaemia is a rare complication. The findings in a 16-year-old boy who presented to an emergency department with symptoms of faecal incontinence are reported herein. Radiological imaging demonstrated soft-tissue masses in the sacral epidural space. The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia was confirmed on bone marrow aspirate. The characteristics and management of extramedullary leukaemia are discussed.\n",
      "The rhombotin 2 gene was identified by its association with a recurrent chromosome translocation (11;14)(p13;q11), occurring in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALLs). High levels of RBTN2 have been found in T-cell leukaemias carrying the translocation and in some T-cell ALLs that lack, by cytogenetic and molecular techniques, translocations involving 11p13. In normal murine tissues RBTN2 has been found to be widely expressed, with high levels present in brain and early B cells. Studies carried out in mice lacking RBTN2 have demonstrated the importance of this gene in erythropoiesis. We have investigated the expression of RBTN2 in human leukaemic cells, and in human and murine normal myeloid progenitor cells. RBTN2 is expressed in the leukaemic cells of patients with pre-B ALL, T-ALL and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). By cytogenetic and molecular techniques no abnormalities were noted in 11p13. Using clonogenic assays and single cell PCR we found that RBTN2 is expressed strongly in the precursors of mixed erythrocyte/macrophage/mast, erythrocyte, megakaryocyte, neutrophil and macrophage colonies. In contrast, RBTN2 message was low to undetectable in the mature progeny. These findings indicate that RBTN2 is expressed in leukaemias of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Further, these studies show that in normal myeloid and lymphoid cells the expression of RBTN2 is present in progenitor cells and is lost as the cells terminally differentiate. This latter finding further illustrates that the detection of a RNA in a population of cells should not be interpreted to mean that all of the cells in that population express the RNA.\n",
      "Altered expression of microRNAs, a new class of noncoding RNAs that regulate messenger RNA and protein expression of target genes, has been recently demonstrated to have an essential role in the process of leukaemogenesis. Distinctive patterns of activation and/or silencing of multiple microRNAs (microRNA signatures) associated with certain cytogenetic and molecular subsets of leukaemia have been identified using genome-wide high-throughput profiling assays. This has led not only to the discovery of new molecular pathways implicated in leukaemogenesis, but also supplied prognostic information complementing that gained from cytogenetics, gene mutations and altered gene expression in acute and chronic leukaemias. We review herein results of current studies analysing changes of microRNA expression in acute myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and discuss their potential biologic, diagnostic and prognostic relevance.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The role of infection in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia is unknown. We used prescriptions of antibiotics from Danish pharmacies as a proxy measure for the occurrence of infections. PROCEDURE: We investigated the association between exposure to antibiotics, from conception to leukaemia diagnosis, and the risk of leukaemia. Incident cases of leukaemia among children in Denmark, 1995-2008, with mothers having their earliest conception date in 1995, were individually matched to population controls by age, sex and municipality. Conditional logistic regression analyses assessed antibiotic redemptions in different time periods from conception up to 6 months before the diagnoses of all leukaemia types, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [ALL] and ALL in 2- to 5-year-old children, adjusting for several potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 120/360 (33.3%) leukaemia mothers and 1,081/3,509 (30.8%) control mothers redeemed antibiotics during pregnancy (P = 0.32). For children, the equivalent numbers were 276 (76.7%) and 2,665 (75.9%) (P = 0.76). Histograms of antibiotic redemptions showed no temporal differences between leukaemia mothers/children and controls, which was confirmed in adjusted regression analyses (OR [95% CI]: 1.02 [0.75-1.38]). Only antibiotics redeemed during the first year after birth differed from this (OR [95% CI] for ALL diagnosed in 2- to 5-year-old children: 0.46 [0.31-0.66]). CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis generating study, the similar amount and pattern of antibiotic redemptions in children with and without leukaemia indicate that infections play a minor role in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. However, less antibiotic redemptions during the first year of life conform to Greaves' 'delayed infection hypothesis'.\n",
      "To gain more insight into the immunophenotypic and cytogenetic changes in acute leukaemia at relapse, 99 Korean patients treated at a single institution were studied: acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML, n=46), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, n=44) and biphenotypic and mixed leukaemia (n=9). Immunophenotypic changes at relapse were observed in 51 of 99 patients (51.5%) with almost even distribution in AML and ALL. Overall expression of aberrant markers on leukaemic cells was more frequent at relapse than at initial diagnosis (P < 0.05), and this finding was most prominent in B lineage ALL (41.4% versus 10.3%, P=0.007). Gain of aberrant CD13 or CD33 at relapse of B lineage ALL was most frequently observed. Cytogenetic changes at relapse were observed in 28 of 46 patients (60.8%). The initially abnormal karyotypes were more frequently associated with clonal changes at relapse compared to initially normal karyotypes (78.3% versus 43.5%, P=0.016). Cytogenetic changes were more frequent in B lineage ALL than in AML (90% versus 47.8%, P=0.05). In ALL, patients showing cytogenetic changes at relapse were significantly younger than those showing no changes (mean age of 15.0 versus 38.8, P=0.002), whereas in AML there was no significant difference between the two groups. In conclusion, the gain of aberrant markers and cytogenetic changes at relapse, which are suggestive of clonal instability, are more prevalent in B lineage ALL compared to AML, and lymphoid leukaemic cells of younger patients are more susceptible to clonal changes at relapse.\n",
      "FMC7, a monoclonal antibody used extensively to characterize B cell leukaemias of differentiated phenotype (prolymphocytic, hairy cell, and similar leukaemias) was compared directly with antibodies of the CD22 cluster, which also react with B cells at a late stage in differentiation. Detailed comparison shows that the reaction spectrum, though similar, is not identical. Differences were particularly prominent in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Binding studies show that the antibodies react with different antigenic determinants, and immunochemical studies show that they react with different molecules. The FMC7 antigen, not previously characterized, was shown to be a protein of apparent molecular weight 105,000, by immunoblotting after electrophoresis of membrane extracts.\n",
      "Correct action upon re-emergence of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients has not yet been established. The applicability of demethylating agents and use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation will be dependent on pre-relapse AML growth rates. We here delineate molecular growth kinetics of AML harbouring MLL partial tandem duplication (MLL-PTD; 37 cases) compared to those harbouring MLL translocations (43 cases). The kinetics of MLL-PTD relapses was both significantly slower than those of MLL translocation positive ones (median doubling time: MLL-PTD: 24 d, MLL-translocations: 12 d, P = 0·015, Wilcoxon rank sum test), and displayed greater variation depending on additional mutations. Thus, MLL-PTD+ cases with additional RUNX1 mutations or FLT3-internal tandem duplication relapsed significantly faster than cases without one of those two mutations (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0·042). As rapid relapses occurred in all MLL subgroups, frequent sampling are necessary to obtain acceptable relapse detection rates and times from molecular relapse to haematological relapse (blood sampling every second month: MLL-PTD: 75%/50 d; MLL translocations: 85%/25 d). In conclusion, in this cohort relapse kinetics is heavily dependent on AML subtype as well as additional genetic aberrations, with possibly great consequences for the rational choice of pre-emptive therapies.\n",
      "The method introduced by Knox for evaluation of space-time clustering has been applied to 872 cases of childhood (0-14 year old) leukaemia diagnosed in Greece over the 10 year period 1980-89. Greek towns are characterised by substantial population mixing due to internal migration, whereas there is relative isolation in mountainous rural areas. Predetermined space (5 km) and time (1 year) limits were used on the basis of previous reports in order to define the clustering cell. There is highly significant evidence for clustering of childhood leukaemia in Greece as a whole, the observed number of pairs that are close in both spaces and time exceeding the expected number by 5.2% (P = 0.004). The excess is particularly evident for leukaemia cases in 0 to 4-year-old children, among whom the observed number of pairs that are close in both space and time exceeded the expected number by 9.4% (P = 0.004). There is no evidence of space-time clustering for leukaemia cases older than 5 years. The overall pattern is descriptively similar in urban and semiurban areas and is especially marked for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at the childhood peak ages (2-4 years) with an excess of 19% (P = 0.0006). In the rural population there is evidence for clustering of cases belonging to older and broader age groups, a phenomenon compatible with a delay in the development of herd immunity against putative infectious aetiological agents. The findings of the present study provide support for the hypothesis that a substantial proportion of cases of childhood leukaemia may arise as a rare sequel to exposure to an agent or agents, most probably viral in nature.\n",
      "The modern characterization of acute myeloid leukaemia is a multidisciplinary process. It requires the integration of clinical information, morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic and molecular genetic diagnostic techniques. It is only by bringing all these modalities together that a clear picture of the disease can be presented. This initial work-up provides essential prognostic information of benefit to the patient. The selection of treatment and the monitoring of treatment response are dependent on the findings at the time of diagnosis.\n",
      "Recent studies suggest that the prosurvival signal transduction pathway involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt can confer an aggressive, apoptosis-resistant phenotype to acute leukaemia cells. We have investigated the effect of modulating this signalling pathway on the sensitivity of leukaemic cell lines (NB-4, CEM, Jurkat, MOLT-4) and acute promyelocytic primary blasts to apoptosis induced by 1 micromol/l As2O3. Whereas parental NB-4 cells did not display any phosphorylated (active) Akt, CEM, Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells exhibited high levels of Akt activation. Consistently, treatment of NB-4 cells with pharmacological inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pathway (LY294002, wortmannin) did not increase sensitivity of these cells to arsenic trioxide (As2O3), whereas siRNA knock-down of Akt enhanced As2O3-induced apoptosis of CEM, Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells. Overexpression of a constitutively active Akt cDNA rendered NB-4 cells less susceptible to As2O3. Upon prolonged exposure to As2O3, we isolated a NB-4 cell clone that was resistant to As2O3 and displayed high levels of active Akt. LY294002 treatment of acute promyelocytic primary blasts with elevated Akt phosphorylation levels resulted in an increased sensitivity to As2O3. These results may provide a rationale for the development of combined or sequential treatment with PI3K/Akt inhibitors to improve the efficacy of As2O3 on acute leukaemias and also to overcome As2O3 resistance.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: The availability of historical data decreases the rate of blood smear review rates in outpatients, but we are unaware of studies done at referral centres. In the following study, we determined the effect of historical data on the rates of peripheral blood smears over a 3-month period and then the detection rate of patients with acute leukaemia. METHODS: All results of complete blood counts (CBCs) tested on three ADVIA 120 analyzers at the regional Rabin Medical Centre, Beilinson Campus over a 3-month period were accessed on a computerised laboratory information system. Over a 3-month period, we determined the proportion of total CBC and patients with criteria for a manual differential count and the actual number of peripheral blood smears done. Finally, we determined the proportion of 100 consecutive patients with acute leukaemia detected using our criteria that included limiting reflex testing according to historical data. RESULTS: Over the 3-month period, there were 34,827 tests done in 12,785 patients. Without historical data, our smear rate would have been 24.5%, but with the availability of historical data, the blood smear review rate was 5.6%. The detection rate for cases of acute leukaemia was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the availability of previous test results significantly reduces the need for blood smear review without missing any patients with acute leukaemia.\n",
      "The chronic lymphoproliferative disorders are morphologically, immunologically and clinically heterogeneous. Common features of these processes include T, B or natural killer cell immunophenotypes and terminal deoxy-nucleotidyl transferase negativity. The B cell lymphocytic disorders include B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, B cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia-prolymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including mantle cell lymphoma) in leukaemic phase, hairy cell leukaemia and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes. The T cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders include prolymphocytic leukaemia, adult T cell leukaemia-lymphoma, large granulated lymphocyte leukaemia and Sézary syndrome. Occasionally, a lymphocytic proliferation is encountered that does not satisfy the morphological or immunophenotypical criteria for any of the above categories. These processes are best left unclassified.\n",
      "There have been significant improvements in the outlook for children with acute leukaemia but these advances are only available to a minority of the world children. There is still room for improvements in conventional chemotherapy and these need evaluation in randomised trials. The role of bone marrow transplants in first remission is evolving as chemotherapy becomes more effective. New treatments are needed for relapsed patients. Molecular diagnosis has refined the assessment of prognosis but the extra value afforded by measurement of minimal residual disease is not clear. International collaboration is needed to evaluate treatment for rare subtypes of leukaemia.\n",
      "The interpretation of reports of clusters of childhood leukaemia is difficult, first because little is known about the causes of the disease, and second because there is insufficient information on whether cases show a generalized tendency to cluster geographically. The EUROCLUS project is a European collaborative study whose primary objective is to determine whether the residence locations of cases at diagnosis show a general tendency towards spatial clustering. The second objective is to interpret any patterns observed and, in particular, to see if clustering can be explained in terms of either infectious agents or environmental hazards as aetiological agents. The spatial distribution of 13351 cases of childhood leukaemia diagnosed in 17 countries between 1980 and 1989 has been analysed using the Potthoff-Whittinghill method. The overall results show statistically significant evidence of clustering of total childhood leukaemia within small census areas (P=0.03) but the magnitude of the clustering is small (extra-Poisson component of variance (%) = 1.7 with 90% confidence interval 0.2-3.1). The clustering is most marked in areas that have intermediate population density (150-499 persons km[-2]). It cannot be attributed to any specific age group at diagnosis or cell type and involves spatial aggregation of cases of different ages and cell types. The results indicate that intense clusters are a rare phenomenon that merit careful investigation, although aetiological insights are more likely to come from investigation of large numbers of cases. We present a method for detecting clustering that is simple and readily available to cancer registries and similar groups.\n",
      "Between 1972 and 1988, 832 consecutive patients were treated for acute leukaemia at St. Bartholomew Hospital; a retrospective analysis has been conducted to determine the clinical course and outcome for 101 who have survived > or = 10 years following treatment. At a median follow-up of 16 years (range 10-28 years), 86 patients (86 out of 834 total, 11%) were still alive. Long-term follow-up of patients who have survived > or = 10 years following treatment for acute leukaemia revealed that most patients were in normal health, although a significant number of complications had occurred.\n",
      "Although down-regulation of WNT5A expression has been reported in some types of leukaemias, the level of WNT5A expression has not been assessed in leukaemia complete remission (CR) cases, the relationship among WNT5A expression level, the status of its promoter methylation, and the curative effect of leukaemia has not been reported, and the effect of WNT5A on cell proliferation has not been assessed. In this study, we analyzed WNT5A expression in various kinds of leukaemia cases, leukaemia CR cases, non-malignant hematopoietic (NMH) cases, as well as in leukemic cell lines and CD34+ cells. The methylation status of the WNT5A promoter and the levels of the Wnt5a protein were also studied. We also investigated the effect of Wnt5a on leukemic cell proliferation. WNT5A expression level was higher in NMH but lower in leukaemia cases compared to that in CR-cases (P<0.01), and was expressed at low level in leukemic cell lines K562, U937 and Jurkat. Wnt5a protein was positive in NMH, CR cases and CD34+, but negative in leukaemia cases. WNT5A promoter was methylated in leukaemia cases and all leukemic cell lines, but not in NMH and CR cases. WNT5A expression was up-regulated after exposure to the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) in the K562, U937, Jurkat leukemic cell lines and in 83.3% (10/12) of CR patients after cure, respectively. The increased Wnt5a protein can inhibit K562 malignant proliferation and arrest cell cycle at the G2/M phase after exposure to Aza. These results indicate that WNT5A expression was restored in complete remission cases due to demethylation, and Wnt5a can inhibit leukaemic cell proliferation. We propose that WNT5A can act as a suppressor factor in leukemogenesis and can be used as a potential marker for curative effect assessment in leukaemia.\n",
      "Myeloid leukaemia (ML) is strain specific for RFM mice, which were used in these experiments. We investigated the presence of c-myc protein during the growth of ML and after irradiation of leukaemic cells. Leukaemic spleen cells were investigated 9 (nonterminal phase NTP) or 12 days (terminal phase TP) after the injection of ML cells. Leukaemic cells of NTP were irradiated with X-rays or UV-light. c-Myc protein was detected by immunocytochemical method. c-Myc protein was expressed in 74.98% of spleen cells of healthy RFM mice. In the early period of leukaemia growth (NTP) only 14.33% of c-myc positive cells were found, as opposed to the terminal phase (TP) of leukaemia when 89.7% of c-myc positive cells were detected. These results indicated the connection of growth of ML and the presence of c-myc protein. If the spleen cells of NTP of leukaemia were irradiated by X-rays or UV-light, the number of cells which expressed c-myc protein was extremely increased.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Clinical presentations of childhood leukaemia have been reported in case-only studies. The timing when these presentations start to occur prior to diagnosis is less clear. METHODS: In this nested case-control study, 1,025 and 334 children with lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia, respectively, were matched (1:30) to population-based controls by sex, region and year of birth. An index date was assigned for each control when the matched case was diagnosed. Healthcare access records of cases and controls in the year before the index date were extracted. RESULTS: Children with lymphoid leukaemia started to visit doctors more often at least 2 months before leukaemia diagnosis (P < 0.05). Various presentations were recorded in these visits: rates of haematological presentations, musculoskeletal presentations, and injuries started to increase significantly at least 3 months before diagnosis; rates of respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tract presentations did not increase significantly until the last month. The findings for myeloid lymphoma were less clear, but children appeared to visit doctors more often at least 4 months before diagnosis, and the rate of haematological presentations also started to increase at least 4 months before leukaemia diagnosis. Although haematological presentations were most strongly associated with undiagnosed leukaemia (odds ratio > 290 in the last month), the majority (>96%) of children with haematological presentations did not have leukaemia if they had not been diagnosed in their first visit. CONCLUSIONS: We described a clinical picture in the year before leukaemia diagnosis. These findings revealed ongoing difficulties in early diagnosis of childhood leukaemia in healthcare settings.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Despite marked improvements in childhood leukaemia survival, 20% still die within 5 years of diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between socioeconomic status, as assessed by paternal occupation at birth, and survival from childhood leukaemia in children, using data from the Northern Region Young Persons Malignant Disease Registry. METHODS: All 1007 cases of leukaemia in children aged 0-14 years, diagnosed between 1968 and 2010 and registered with the Registry were studied. Paternal occupational social class at the time of the child birth was obtained and analysed in relation to survival using Cox-proportional regression. RESULTS: Compared with the most advantaged group (I/II), those in the middle group (IIIN/M) had a 68% increased risk of death, while those in the least advantaged group (IV/V) had 86% higher risk for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. While the survival advantage of children in class I/II was apparent from the time of diagnosis, survival for children in groups IIIN/M and IV/V were comparable until 3-4 years after diagnosis, when they began to minimally diverge. CONCLUSION: The existence of such socioeconomic disparities cannot be attributed to accessibility to health care in the United Kingdom. Further research into the likely factors underlying these disparities is required.\n",
      "PURPOSE: As the most recent epidemiological studies provide no definite conclusions about the effects of 50/60 Hz magnetic fields (MFs) on the incidence of leukaemia in humans, animal models in a well-controlled environment are useful for evaluating the possibility of an association between MFs and leukaemia. The present study was designed to determine whether 50 Hz magnetic fields can alter the progression of leukaemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A well-characterized model of transplantable acute myeloid leukaemia in rats was used for the first time. This model is closely related to human acute myeloid leukaemia, the type most frequently reported in epidemiological studies of adults. After leukaemic cell implantation, rats were exposed to a sinusoidal 50 Hz MF of 100 microT for 18 h a day, 7 days a week, throughout leukaemia progression. The parameters investigated were: survival time, body weight, haematologic parameters, infiltration of blood, bone marrow, spleen and liver by leukaemic cells. RESULTS: The results showed no significant changes (p > 0.05) in leukaemic MF-exposed versus unexposed rats for any of the parameters involved in leukaemia progression. CONCLUSION: These data do not support the hypothesis that 50 Hz magnetic fields influence leukaemia progression in humans.\n",
      "Biphenotypic acute leukaemia (BAL) is a rare type of leukaemia. Whether patients with BAL should be treated with regimens designed for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) or both remain unclear. We have reviewed the clinical data for 31 BAL patients. Most patients co-expressed B-lymphoid and myeloid markers. No specific chromosomal abnormality was identified. The majority of the patients were treated with regimens devised for treating ALL. Seven patients were treated with regimens designed for AML. Complete remission (CR) rates of 78% and 57% were noted respectively. The overall survival probability at 2 years was 60%.\n",
      "Natural killer (NK) cell neoplasms, which include extra-nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (nasal and extra-nasal) and aggressive NK cell leukaemia, are generally rare, but they are more common in people of Oriental, Mexican and South American descent. These neoplasms are highly aggressive, and show a strong association with Epstein-Barr virus. Aggressive NK cell leukaemia affects younger patients, who present with poor general condition, fever, and disseminated disease; they often die within a short time from systemic disease or complications such as multi-organ failure. Aggressive NK cell leukaemia must be distinguished from T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukaemia and indolent NK cell lympho-proliferative disorder, both of which are indolent. We present a case of young Asian male with aggressive NK cell leukaemia who presented with a poor general condition and disseminated disease. The patient had a rapidly progressive disease and died within weeks of diagnosis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Haematological malignancies seldom cause clinically significant liver disease. Acute liver failure as the initial manifestation of acute leukaemia is very rare and carries a very poor prognosis. METHODS/RESULTS: Three cases of acute liver failure secondary to acute leukaemia are described. Each case presented initially as acute liver failure of uncertain cause. Specific treatment for the leukaemia was instituted; however, all three patients died as a consequence of the liver failure. We describe the clinical course and relevant investigations of these patients and discuss possible mechanisms of acute liver failure in this setting. CONCLUSION: Acute leukaemia presenting as acute liver failure has a very poor prognosis. Although a rare cause of acute liver failure, it should be considered in any patient presenting with acute liver failure with prodromal symptoms and a raised peripheral white cell count, lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid.\n",
      "The membrane expression of CD45R isoforms by leukaemic blasts from 92 cases of acute myeloid (AML) and 12 cases of lymphoblastic leukaemia was analysed by single and two-colour flow cytometry. Compared to normal mature granulocytes, which invariably expressed UCHL1 (CD45RO) but not 2H4 (CD45RA), leukaemic myeloid blasts showed 2H4+ UCHL1- and 2H4- ++UCHL1- composite patterns of expression with the first of these phenotypes being associated in particular with the most immature AML subtype (M0). Similar analyses of blast cell fractions from monocytic AML variants, revealed wide variation in CD45R expression in cases of M4, whereas M5 leukaemias were typically 2H4+ ++UCHL1+ with minor 2H4- UCHL1- components. As most normal mature monocytes were also 2H4+ ++UCHL1+, this suggested that monocytic myeloid differentiation was primarily associated with the \"acquisition\" of UCHL1 and the development of 2H4/UCHL1 co-expressing cells. The expression of membrane CD45RA by leukaemic blasts is an abnormal characteristic and may be related to the maintenance of an undifferentiated state by malignant myeloid precursors.\n",
      "Maintenance therapy is not part of current standard treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, in other leukaemias, maintenance therapy is used to prolong responses and increase the cure rate. While maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to improve outcome in AML, several other maintenance strategies are currently being tested in this disease, including immunotherapy, demethylating agents and targeted therapies. While maintenance chemotherapy does not appear to have a role in AML curative therapy, the novel maintenance strategies currently being tested appear promising and warrant further study.\n",
      "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a key component of the epigenetic machinery regulating gene expression, and behave as oncogenes in several cancer types, spurring the development of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) as anticancer drugs. This review discusses new results regarding the role of HDACs in cancer and the effect of HDACi on tumour cells, focusing on haematological malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukaemia. Histone deacetylases may have opposite roles at different stages of tumour progression and in different tumour cell sub-populations (cancer stem cells), highlighting the importance of investigating these aspects for further improving the clinical use of HDACi in treating cancer.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: During the course of the 1960s and 1970s, acute leukaemia in childhood ceased to be invariably fatal and was recategorized as curable. The meaning of cure in this case, however, was problematic, as it was impossible for physicians to be certain that cancer would not return. This paper uses historical methods to explore how remission was understood by families with children with acute leukaemia during the period in which the first cures were announced, roughly 1972-77. METHODS: These comprised documentary analysis of records of the Medical Research Council leukaemia working parties, published papers and letters on treatments for childhood leukaemia, and interviews with eight UK paediatric oncologists practising in UK hospitals in the 1960s and 1970s. RESULTS: Two approaches to defining 'cure' in leukaemia can be identified. The first relied on statistical assessment of survival rates. I argue that the concept of 'indefinite remission' came to serve for researchers and clinicians as a proxy measure of cure. However, the concept of 'indefinite remission' left many patients and their families quite uncertain as to whether a cure had really happened. A second approach to defining cure therefore developed. Faced with uncertainty, patients, parents and psychologists sought to develop alternative measures of success--including the notion of 'psychological cure'--that brought forward the moment of cure and its relief. CONCLUSIONS: Changing conceptualizations of leukaemia shaped and were shaped by negotiations over the meaning of 'remission' and 'cure'. On the one hand, the statistical definition of cure was not available for years. On the other hand, psychological cure could begin from the time of first remission, even if medical absolution was not available for years.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of apoptosis is important in carcinogenesis. AIM AND METHODS: To analyse the potential inactivation of the DAP kinase/p14/HDM2/p53/Apaf-1 pathway by aberrant promoter methylation in acute leukaemias. RESULTS: Of five leukaemic lines examined, p14 was unmethylated in Raji, HL60 and U937, but completely deleted in Jurkat and NB4. DAP kinase was totally methylated in Raji and NB4, but unmethylated in HL60, Jurkat and U937. Apaf-1 was unmethylated in all the lines. At diagnosis, DAP kinase methylation occurred in eight (25%) APL patients and none of the other AML patients (8/32 vs 0/50, p = 0.001). DAP kinase methylation was detected in four (16%) ALL patients. p14 and Apaf-1 methylation was not detected in any of the 32 cases of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), 50 cases of other subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and 25 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Among AML subtypes, DAP kinase is preferentially hypermethylated in APL.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that participate in vital cell processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. In recent years, they have been proven to play vital roles in haematological malignancies. In this review we briefly introduce some basic knowledge of microRNAs and summarize their ectopic expression in haematological malignancies, especially in leukaemia. We will also discuss the potential of microRNAs in the diagnosis of leukaemia, in the determination of the clinical prognosis of diverse subtypes, and in targeted therapy. DISCUSSION: Despite current adoption of novel biological agents combining traditional chemotherapy regimens, leukaemia remains to have undesirable clinical outcomes due to inaccurate diagnosis, invasiveness of the disease, and patients' intolerance to chemotherapy, thus brand new therapeutic directions are urgently needed. MiRNAs regulate gene expression by means of binding to the 3'-untranslated regions of corresponding mRNAs, leading to the degradation of targeted mRNA or the inhibition of translation. It has been confirmed that they can either function as tumour inhibitors, or may trigger tumourigenesis in certain situations, this specific dual characteristic undoubtedly attract scientists to explore their roles in haematological malignancies. It is of great necessity to summarize the roles of miRNAs in haematological malignancies diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and clinical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies may take full advantage of miRNAs detection in diagnosing, in choosing targeted biological therapy, and in avoiding predictable side effect, thus the overall survival rate and cure efficiency of leukaemia should improve.\n",
      "When young people enter a hospital they are exposed to a foreign world of unfamiliar people, medical equipment and language. Children diagnosed with leukaemia are particularly vulnerable to repeated exposure to these distressing hospital visits. Assessing a child understanding of the stresses associated with treatment during hospitalization is now seen as a key element of caring for the paediatric patient. A population particularly vulnerable to the effects of the stress of intensive treatments during hospitalization are preschool children. In order to understand the impact on leukaemia preschool children of intensive hospital treatment it is necessary to have comparative information on healthy peers who have not been exposed to such treatment experiences. This article presents findings from recent qualitative research that explored the beliefs held by healthy preschoolers about what happens in hospital, what it means to be sick, their reactions to and knowledge of medical equipment and their level of knowledge regarding cancer and leukaemia. It is the hope and expectation that the findings will be used comparatively to contribute to a deeper understanding of the world of the child coping with leukaemia and related disorders.\n",
      "In a group of 56 patients with acute leukaemia, the relation between leukaemic cell motility and peripheral leukaemic cell count, degree of organomegaly, maturation and FAB classification was investigated. Cell motility was studied by means of directly observed motility and scoring of handmirror cells and anti-HLA-capping. The percentage of moving cells in the peripheral blood was higher than in the bone marrow. A positive correlation was found between the percentage of moving cells in the peripheral blood and the peripheral leukaemic cell count. In acute myeloid leukaemia, the percentage of moving cells in the bone marrow and the degree of organomegaly were higher in the monoblastic groups than in the myeloblastic groups. No correlation was found between directly observed motility, handmirror cells and capping. Leukaemic cell motility can play a role in the egress of leukaemic cells from the bone marrow, resulting in a higher tumour mass, thereby influencing prognosis.\n",
      "During a 15-month period, we used in vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BUDR) infusion to study cell kinetics in 112 consecutive patients with various types of malignant tumours: acute leukaemia (50 patients), gastric cancer (42) and brain gliomas (20). The in vivo BUDR method requires that a single tumour sample be taken 4-6 h after infusion and that bivariate flow cytometry (FCM) be employed to measure simultaneously the percentage of BUDR-labelled cells (which are identified with a green fluorescent anti-BUDR monoclonal antibody) and their mean DNA content (following propidium iodide staining). This technique rapidly furnishes the labelling index (LI) and the DNA synthesis time (TS), from which the tumour potential doubling time (Tpot) and production rate (fractional turnover rate, FTR) are calculated. The procedure took 6-9 h to complete and there was no immediate toxicity from BUDR administration. Successful LI and TS determinations were obtained in 89 (80%) and 80 (72%) of the 112 patients, respectively. Correlations were sought between kinetic parameters and a number of pathological and clinical ones. In 34 patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemias who were uniformly treated for remission (CR) induction and maintenance, proliferative activity, as measured by Tpot and FTR, was greater in responsive than in non-responsive patients, and in those who experienced CR for over 8 months than in those who had a shorter CR. Proliferative activity was also greater in patients with advanced gastric cancers than in those with more limited disease. No correlations between kinetic and clinical and pathological parameters were found in gliomas. These data indicate the in vivo BUDR infusion coupled with FCM measurements can be performed in clinical settings to obtain kinetic data rapidly in quite large patient series. This will probably allow the inclusion of kinetic data in clinical trials aimed at evaluating the prognostic relevance of these data.\n",
      "Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in paediatric leukaemias. Antifungal combinations to treat these patients are being explored. Fourteen children with leukaemias and IFIs were treated with a combination of antifungal agents at our centre. The first antifungal was amphotericin-B in 13 children and voriconazole in one child. In view of no improvement and clinical deterioration, in nine patients, voriconazole was added as the second antifungal agent and in four, it was caspofungin. All patients completed 4-6 weeks of antifungal therapy. The overall mortality attributable to IFI for the cohort was 4/14 (28%).\n",
      "The FAB classification of acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemias has been shown to have some clinical use in the prognostication of patient survival. ANLL with monocytoid features (M4, M5) fare worse than those which are predominantly myeloblastic (M1, M2). Classification is, however, sometimes difficult if non-specific esterase activity is not strongly expressed. Monoclonal antibody characterisation of myeloid differentiation antigens may be of some use as a supplementary aid. We immunophenotyped the blast cells from 26 cases for HLA-Dr, CD14 (Mo2, My4), CD13 (My17) and CD33 (My9) expression using the APAAP method. A combination of CD14 and CD33 used together was useful in differentiating myeloblastic from monocytoid acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemias. We conclude that the use of surface markers is a useful adjunct to the diagnostic means presently available.\n",
      "Massive sludging of leukaemic cells in blood vessels is a frequent and often lethal complication of leukaemia. In a retrospective clinicopathological study on the causes of death in 52 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and myeloproliferative disease, pulmonary leucostasis was found in 40% of the patients. In many of these patients the vessels of the heart, brain and testes were also involved. In search for signs and symptoms specific for leucostasis, the clinical records of the 21 patients with leucostasis (the study group) were compared to those of 20 patients without leucostasis (the control group). Dysfunction of the organs most affected by leucostasis, namely lungs, heart and brain, was found more often in the study group than in the controls, but the combination of unexplained fever with cardiopulmonary and/or central nervous system failure occurred almost exclusively and in half of the patients with leucostasis. Leucostasis occurs predominantly, but not exclusively, in patients with high leucocyte counts, and especially, but again not exclusively, when the leucocyte counts rise sharply.\n",
      "Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are defined as unspecialized cells that give rise to more differentiated cells. In a similar way, leukaemic stem and progenitor cells (LSPCs) are defined as unspecialized leukaemic cells, which can give rise to more differentiated cells. Leukaemic cells carry leukaemic mutations/variants and have clear differentiation abnormalities. Pre-leukaemic HSPCs (PreL-HSPCs) carry pre-leukaemic mutations/variants (pLMs) and are capable of producing mature functional cells, which will carry the same variants. Under the roof of LSPCs, one can find a broad range of cell types genetic and disease phenotypes. Present-day knowledge suggests that this phenotypic heterogeneity is the result of interactions between the cell of origin, the genetic background and the microenvironment background. The combination of these attributes will define the LSPC phenotype, frequency, differentiation capacity and evolutionary trajectory. Importantly, as LSPCs are leukaemia-initiating cells that sustain clinical remission and are the source of relapse, an improved understanding of LSPCs phenotype would offer better clinical opportunities for the treatment and hopefully prevention of human leukaemia. The current review will focus on LSPCs attributes in the context of human haematologic malignancies.\n",
      "A population-based case-control study of leukaemia and residential proximity to electricity supply equipment has been carried out in south-east England. A total of 771 leukaemias was studied, matched for age, sex, year of diagnosis and district of residence to 1,432 controls registered with a solid tumour excluding lymphoma; 231 general population controls aged 18 and over from one part of the study area were also used. The potential for residential exposure to power frequency magnetic fields from power-lines and transformer substations was assessed indirectly from the distance, type and loading of the equipment near each subject residence. Only 0.6% of subjects lived within 100 m of an overhead power-line, and the risk of leukaemia relative to cancer controls for residence within 100 m was 1.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-3.88); within 50 m the relative risk was 2.0 but with a wider confidence interval (95% CI 0.4-9.0). Over 40% of subjects lived within 100 m of a substation, for which the relative risk of leukaemia was 0.99. Residence within 25 m carried a risk of 1.3 (95% CI 0.8-2.0). Weighted exposure indices incorporating measures of the current load carried by the substations did not materially alter these risks estimates. For persons aged less than 18 the relative risk of leukaemia from residence within 50 m of a substation was higher than in adults (PR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.7-3.4).\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Identification of geographical areas and ecological factors associated with higher incidence of childhood leukaemias can direct further study for preventable factors and location of health services to manage such individuals. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the geographical variation and the socio-demographic factors associated with childhood leukaemia in Manitoba. METHODS: Information on childhood leukaemia incidence between 1992 and 2008 was obtained from the Canadian Cancer Registry and the socio-demographic characteristics for the area of residence from the 2006 Canadian Census. Bayesian spatial Poisson mixed models were used to describe the geographical variation of childhood leukaemia and to determine the association between childhood leukaemia and socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: The south-eastern part of the province had a higher incidence of childhood leukaemia than other parts of the province. In the age and sex-adjusted Poisson regression models, areas with higher proportions of visible minorities and immigrant residents had higher childhood leukaemia incidence rate ratios. In the saturated Poisson regression model, the childhood leukaemia rates were higher in areas with higher proportions of immigrant residents. Unemployment rates were not a significant factor in leukaemia incidence. CONCLUSION: In Manitoba, areas with higher proportions of immigrants experience higher incidence rates of childhood leukaemia. We have identified geographical areas with higher incidence, which require further study and attention.\n",
      "23 patients with ALL (n=9) and AML (n=14) underwent nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) from an HLA-identical donor after conditioning with fludarabine (180 mg/m(2)), busulfan (8 mg/kg) and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (40 mg/kg). After NST, 20/23 patients engrafted. Ten out of 14 patients with uncontrolled disease reached complete remission. A multiplex-PCR using short tandem repeats was used for chimerism analysis and detected mixed chimerism (MC) in 14/22 evaluable patients (64%) after NST. Prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were given to 11/14 patients with MC; MC converted to complete donor chimerism (CC) in 6/11 patients within 2-6 weeks. All patients with persistent MC with or without DLI relapsed during further follow-up. MC predicted impending relapse 4-52 weeks before clinical diagnosis. Ten of 23 patients (43%) are alive 2-34 months after stem cell transplantation. 12 of 23 patients (52%), have died from leukaemia after NST. One out of 23 patients has died from severe sepsis. In conclusion, NST leads to stable engraftment and complete remission in patients with advanced acute leukaemias. NST can cure a substantial proportion of these patients, but the relapse rate is still high. Repeated chimerism analysis is a useful tool to detect recipient cells, especially in patients without molecular markers of disease and can be used to monitor immunomodulatory therapies. MC is unstable in these patients and predicts impending relapse. Prophylactic DLI can convert MC to CC, which seemed to lower relapse risk.\n",
      "Haemobartonella felis infection was demonstrated in 38 cats which could be divided into four groups as follows: group A, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) free cats with H felis infection alone; group B, FeLV free cats with H felis infection and other clinical conditions; group C, FeLV positive cats with H felis infection but no clinical manifestation of FeLV related or any other intercurrent disease; and group D, FeLV positive cats with H felis infection and clinical manifestations of FeLV related or other diseases. Cats in group A were healthy carriers of the infection and none was anaemic, whereas some in group B had clinical haemobartonellosis and anaemia. This anaemia was mainly mild, normocytic and normochromic. Most of the cats in group C and all in group D were more severely ill and anaemic, the anaemia usually being macrocytic and hypochromic. Splenomegaly occurred only in groups C and D. Treatment with tetracyclines did not eliminate H felis from any of the cats and blood transfusions were ineffective in promoting long term recovery from anaemia in cats with intercurrent H felis and FeLV infections. The findings in the cats in groups C and D were further compared with those in a fifth group of cats which were infected with FeLV but free of H felis.\n",
      "A case of acute leukaemia is reported in which blast cells expressed some B-related antigens (namely the CALLA antigen) and no peroxidase activity at the optical level; however, some mature granular cells contained Auer rods. Simultaneous characterization of ultrastructural morphology, cytochemistry and immune phenotype was performed. There was an apparent mutual exclusion in the expression of myeloperoxidase activity and the CALLA antigen, and a heterogeneity in the CALLA expression among the blastic population. These results disagree with the hypothesis of a true biphenotypic leukaemia and demonstrate a complete heterogeneity between the lymphoblastoid cells and the myeloid ones. The interest of such a simple combined method in a case of putative hybrid acute leukaemia is emphasized.\n",
      "A population-based sample of acute childhood leukaemia cases in Sweden 1973-94 was analysed by a geographical information system (GIS) for spatial leukaemia distribution in relation to population density. The annual incidence rate for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was 3.6, and for acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) 0.7, cases per 100,000 children. Incidence rates in population centres, constituting 1.3% of Sweden land area and approximately 80% of the population, compared with the rest of Sweden showed a statistically significant excess of ALL [odds ratio (OR) 1.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-1.95], but not ANLL (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.98-1.32). An increasing trend, however not statistically significant, was found for ALL incidence with both increasing population density in parishes and increasing degree of urbanity in municipalities. These findings support the theories that some environmental factors associated with high population density, such as infectious agents, may be of aetiological importance for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n",
      "CONTEXT: Acute leukaemia diagnosis is a field requiring automated solutions, tools and methods and the ability to facilitate early detection and even prediction. Many studies have focused on the automatic detection and classification of acute leukaemia and their subtypes to promote enable highly accurate diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review and analyse literature related to the detection and classification of acute leukaemia. The factors that were considered to improve understanding on the field various contextual aspects in published studies and characteristics were motivation, open challenges that confronted researchers and recommendations presented to researchers to enhance this vital research area. METHODS: We systematically searched all articles about the classification and detection of acute leukaemia, as well as their evaluation and benchmarking, in three main databases: ScienceDirect, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore from 2007 to 2017. These indices were considered to be sufficiently extensive to encompass our field of literature. RESULTS: Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 89 articles were selected. Most studies (58/89) focused on the methods or algorithms of acute leukaemia classification, a number of papers (22/89) covered the developed systems for the detection or diagnosis of acute leukaemia and few papers (5/89) presented evaluation and comparative studies. The smallest portion (4/89) of articles comprised reviews and surveys. DISCUSSION: Acute leukaemia diagnosis, which is a field requiring automated solutions, tools and methods, entails the ability to facilitate early detection or even prediction. Many studies have been performed on the automatic detection and classification of acute leukaemia and their subtypes to promote accurate diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Research areas on medical-image classification vary, but they are all equally vital. We expect this systematic review to help emphasise current research opportunities and thus extend and create additional research fields.\n",
      "In 40 febrile neutropenic episodes during the induction and consolidation chemotherapy of acute leukaemia in Riyadh, 51% of organisms causing septicaemia were gram-negative, 26% gram-positive, 8% anaerobes and 15% fungi. In 21 (52%) febrile episodes there were pulmonary infiltrates; of the 12 where aetiology was known, six were due to fungi. Pulmonary infiltrates progressed to adult respiratory distress syndrome and death in nine instances. There was no significant occurrence of parasitic and tropical infections. The results show that the pattern of infection, during therapy of acute leukaemia in developing countries, may have important differences when compared with western centres. Empiric amphotericin B may need to be introduced at an earlier stage in patients with persistent fever or progressive pulmonary infiltrates.\n",
      "Patients with leukaemia can exhibit signs or complain of symptoms in the oral cavity and oropharynx; indeed, these may be the initial presenting complaints of the disease. Septicaemia is common in patients undergoing treatment, and has been reported as having an oral cause in up to 50% of cases. This article reports four patients presenting to dental practitioners with leukaemia, and discusses the management of dental problems in patients with the disease.\n",
      "A 17 days old male infant, who had features of Down Syndrome, presented with fever, refusal to feed and seizures. He had papular, crusted skin lesions, moderate hepatosplenomegaly and a rapid downhill course. Peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate showed features of acute leukaemia. Congenital Leukaemia is a rare malignancy associated with a very poor prognosis. Paradoxically, many cases of Congenital Leukaemia, especially in infants with Down Syndrome, show spontaneous remission.\n",
      "Purified preparations of circulating leukaemic blast cells from patients with acute myeloid (M1-7) or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and the myeloid or lymphoid cells from patients with chronic myeloid or lymphocytic forms of leukaemia, were incorporated into clots prepared from fibrinogen and plasminogen. Patterns of lysis were followed and measured by light transmission in a microtitre plate reader. Mature polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell fractions from normal individuals were studied concurrently for comparison. Blast cells from the myeloid forms of acute leukaemia (M2-4) and 'myeloid' cell fractions from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia were capable of lysing plasminogen-containing clots; this activity was neutralized by addition of immunoglobulin against urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA), but not by anti-tissue plasmogen activator (t-PA). Mature polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells from normal individuals lacked lytic activity, as did the leukaemic cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Lysed blast cells showed the presence of free plasminogen activator on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with overlay zymography, also neutralized by anti-u-PA, whereas normal polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells did not. These observations suggest that mechanisms underlying some forms of severe bleeding in acute myeloid leukaemias have a critical fibrinolytic component generated by the blast cells themselves.\n",
      "Recent findings related to childhood leukaemia incidence near nuclear installations have raised questions which can be answered neither by current knowledge on radiation risk nor by other established risk factors. In 2012, a workshop was organised on this topic with two objectives: (a) review of results and discussion of methodological limitations of studies near nuclear installations; (b) identification of directions for future research into the causes and pathogenesis of childhood leukaemia. The workshop gathered 42 participants from different disciplines, extending widely outside of the radiation protection field. Regarding the proximity of nuclear installations, the need for continuous surveillance of childhood leukaemia incidence was highlighted, including a better characterisation of the local population. The creation of collaborative working groups was recommended for consistency in methodologies and the possibility of combining data for future analyses. Regarding the causes of childhood leukaemia, major fields of research were discussed (environmental risk factors, genetics, infections, immunity, stem cells, experimental research). The need for multidisciplinary collaboration in developing research activities was underlined, including the prevalence of potential predisposition markers and investigating further the infectious aetiology hypothesis. Animal studies and genetic/epigenetic approaches appear of great interest. Routes for future research were pointed out.\n",
      "Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) is a malignancy with a high cure rate; however, delay in diagnosis or treatment can result in morbidity and mortality. APML has characteristic clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic and molecular features. In patients with acute leukaemia, a high index of suspicion is required to exclude APML. Very rarely APML patients at diagnosis can demonstrate atypical features. We reported a patient whose bone marrow features resembled acute myeloid leukaemia with predominantly agranular blasts, devoid of Auer rods and expressing CD34 and HLA-DR on flow cytometry. APML was not suspected initially but after cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies demonstrated t(15;17), appropriate therapy with ATRA+ chemotherapy was instituted and the patient showed remarkable and sustained response to treatment. This case highlights the fact that morphology and immunophenotyping are useful but not infallible indicators for these malignancies and, ultimate diagnoses will require detection of the characteristic molecular markers.\n",
      "The relationships between acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and human herpes virus (HHV)-6 antibody level were investigated in a multicentre case-control study. An association between increased HHV-6 seropositivity and geometric mean titre ratio with AML was shown: P for trend = 0.022, adjusted odds ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.33 respectively. No association was found between HHV-6 and ALL, CML or RAEB.\n",
      "Spergualin was isolated from the culture filtrate of Bacillus laterosporus as an antitumour substance. It had a unique structure and was shown to have chemotherapeutic effects on mouse transplantable leukaemias such as L-1210, P-388, P-815, C-1489, EL-4 and RL male 1. It was especially effective to L-1210 leukaemia and the leukaemia-bearing mice were even curable by the optimal dose of this drug. When the spergualin-treated cured mice were inoculated again by L-1210 cells, those leukaemic cells did not grow in the animals suggesting that specific immunity to L-1210 had been induced. In this induction of immunity cytotoxic T lymphocytes were suggested to be involved. Cytostatic effect of spergualin in cell culture was dependent on the content of amine oxidase in serum. In the study of structure-activity relationship, the 15-hydroxy group was found to be not necessary, while the spermidine moiety was essential for antitumour activity. 15-Deoxy derivative of spergualin was found to be more potent in antitumour activity.\n",
      "Recent studies support the potential application of the wt-p53 gene in cancer therapy. Expression of exogenous wt-p53 suppresses a variety of leukaemia phenotypes by acting on cell survival, proliferation and/or differentiation. As for tumour gene therapy, the final fate of the neoplastic cells is one of the most relevant points. We examined the effects of exogenous wt-p53 gene expression in several leukaemia cell lines to identify p53-responsive leukaemia. The temperature-sensitive p53Val135 mutant or the human wt-p53 cDNA was transduced in leukaemia cell lines representative of different acute leukaemia FAB subtypes, including M1 (KG1), M2 (HL-60), M3 (NB4), M5 (U937) and M6 (HEL 92.1.7), as well as blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (BC-CML: K562, BV173) showing diverse differentiation features. By morphological, molecular and biochemical analyses, we have shown that exogenous wt-p53 gene expression induces apoptosis only in cells corresponding to M1, M2 and M3 of the FAB classification and in BC-CML showing morphological and cytochemical features of undifferentiated blast cells. In contrast, it promotes differentiation in the others. Interestingly, cell responsiveness was independent of the vector used and the status of the endogenous p53 gene.\n",
      "We report the rare case of a patient with leukaemia cutis first presenting only on the hand and fingers and then subsequently spreading over the trunk and face. The lesions heralded the transformation of a previously undiagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome type RAEB (refractory anaemia with blast excess) into frank myeloid leukaemia. The haematological disease was first detected by the dermatohistopathologist. This case underlines the need to look meticulously for skin changes and perform early skin biopsies in haematological patients, as the skin can reveal the first clinical signs of an otherwise not evident bone marrow disorder. Leukaemia cutis as the initial clinical presentation of a transforming myelodysplastic syndrome type RAEB into acute myeloid leukaemia has been reported only very rarely.\n",
      "We have studied the immunophenotypic features in patients with chronic lymphoid leukaemia and investigated the suitability of classification according to guidelines of the French-American-British (FAB) group. Immunophenotyping was carried out on cytocentrifuge preparations of mononuclear blood leukocytes using the alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method. The 114 leukaemias, including 58 cases of B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), 3 Waldenström macroglobulinaemia, 6 prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-PL), 13 B-CLL/PL, 4 B-CLL of mixed cell type, 8 splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL), 8 hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), two HCL variant, three leukaemic phase of follicular lymphoma, two leukaemic phase of intermediate lymphoma, two plasma cell leukaemia and two chronic T-cell leukaemia, were investigated. The 111 of 112 B-chronic lymphoid leukaemias (B-CLL + B-PL + B-CLL/PL + SLVL + HCL etc.) showed monotypic light chains. The antibody HML1 was highly specific for HCL. The antibodies CD11c and CD25 were positive in all HCL cases, but were not specific for this disease. CD5 positivity and CD22s negativity were found in most patients with B-CLL, B-CLL/PL and B-CLL of mixed type. This marker type has a limited value for differentiation from the other chronic lymphoid leukaemias. We also studied three patients with chronic lymphoid leukaemia which were not described by the FAB classification. We conclude that a study of the morphology of the leukaemic cells was the most useful basis for the diagnosis of these leukaemias, whereas immunotyping was apparently valuable only in individual cases.\n",
      "There is growing realization that many - if not all - cancer-cell populations contain a subpopulation of self-renewing stem cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Unlike normal adult stem cells that remain constant in number, CSCs can increase in number as tumours grow, and give rise to progeny that can be both locally invasive and colonise distant sites - the two hallmarks of malignancy. Immunodeficient mouse models in which human tumours can be xenografted provide persuasive evidence that CSCs are present in human leukaemias and many types of solid tumour. In addition, many studies have found similar subpopulations in mouse tumours that show enhanced tumorigenic properties when they are transplanted into histocompatible mice. In this Commentary, we refer to CSCs as tumour-propagating cells (TPCs), a term that reflects the assays that are currently employed to identify them. We first discuss evidence that cancer can originate from normal stem cells or closely related descendants. We then outline the attributes of TPCs and review studies in which they have been identified in various cancers. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for successful cancer therapies.\n",
      "Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is increasingly reported as an important outcome in cancer clinical trials. However, very little evidence exists on the impact of such evaluation in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of leukaemia patients. A systematic search of the literature from 1980 to 2007 was undertaken and studies were identified and evaluated independently, according to a pre-defined coding scheme, by three reviewers. Both HRQOL outcomes and traditional clinical reported outcomes were systematically analysed to evaluate their consistency and their relevance for supporting clinical decision making. Nine RCTs were identified, involving 3838 patients overall. There were four RCTs involving acute myeloid leukaemia patients (AML), three with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and two with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Six studies were published after 2000 and provided fairly robust methodological quality. Imatinib greatly improved HRQOL compared to interferon based treatments in CML patients and fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide does not seem to have a deleterious impact on patient HRQOL when compared to fludarabine alone or chlorambucil in CLL patients. This study revealed the paucity of HRQOL research in leukaemia patients. Nonetheless, HRQOL assessment is feasible in RCTs and has the great potential of providing valuable outcomes to further support clinical decision making.\n",
      "Oral chemotherapy agents have been an important component of the treatment of leukaemia for many years. Obstacles such as poor or erratic bioavailability and noncompliance have often limited the utility of oral agents in the treatment of leukaemia. However, recent evaluations of new or existing oral agents have expanded the clinician options and understanding of the use of these drugs in the treatment of leukaemia. One major advance is the use of tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid) in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Tretinoin, an oral vitamin A derivative that reverses abnormal differentiation in APL is now an essential component of first-line therapy for APL, replacing standard intravenous chemotherapy induction regimens. Other advances include an increased understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of oral chemotherapy agents such as etoposide and high dose busulfan, allowing for modifications or individualisation of administration regimens to enhance efficacy or minimise toxicity. Evaluations of noncompliance with oral agents in the treatment of leukaemia have also provided the clinician with important information on how this obstacle to oral therapy may be overcome or minimised.\n",
      "GATA1 is a prototypical lineage-restricted transcription factor that is central to the correct differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells. Mutations in GATA1 can generate a truncated protein, which contributes to the genesis of transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL) in infants with Down syndrome. Similarly, Gata1 knockdown to 5% of its wild-type level causes high incidence of erythroid leukaemia in mice. The GATA1-related leukaemias in both human and mouse could provide important insights into the mechanism of multi-step leukaemogenesis. Efforts are afoot to produce mouse models that are reflective of TMD and AMKL.\n",
      "Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare complication of leukaemia. An association between monosomy 7 and DI in leukaemias has been proposed. We present a case of Ph1-positive CML who developed polyuria at the time of lymphoid blast transformation associated with loss of chromosome 7. Biochemical results were not diagnostic of DI and a therapeutic trial of DDAVP was unsuccessful. Post-mortem showed a peripituitary and renal leukaemic infiltrate and although DI is a possibility, the cause of his polyuria remains unresolved.\n",
      "The 1988 UCLA symposium on bone marrow transplantation (BMT) provided a comprehensive overview of the current position of this therapy in its widest sense. Major consideration was given to the role of BMT in the treatment of the acute and chronic leukaemias, with particular reference to the timing of this procedure in these disorders. The use of autologous grafting in haematological and non-haematological malignancy was discussed, and the results of BMT in aplastic anaemia and the inherited immune and metabolic diseases were presented. The prevention and therapy of the major post-transplant complications, cytomegalovirus interstitial pneumonitis and graft-versus-host disease, were the subject of lengthy deliberations as were the related topics of T cell depletion, graft-versus-leukaemia and the use of partially matched related or matched unrelated donors.\n",
      "The serum immunoglobulin levels were studied in 25 healthy control subjects and 23 cases of leukaemia (6 cases of acute lymphatic leukaemia, 5 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia, 2 cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia and 10 cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia) and 17 cases of malignant lymphoma (13 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and 4 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma). The mean levels of IgG, IgA and IgM in 25 control subjects were 1573.56 +/- 91.45 mg/dl, 209.64 +/- 12.55 mg/dl and 109.81 +/- 10.03 mg/dl respectively, those in 23 cases of leukaemia were 1338.23 +/- 109.74 mg/dl, 195.53 +/- 20.72 mg/dl and 127.47 +/- 13.29 mg/dl respectively and those in 17 cases of malignant lymphoma were 996.99 +/- 99.50 mg/dl, 147.47 +/- 19.61 mg/dl and 129.35 +/- 19.95 mg/dl respectively. The mean levels of IgG and IgA were found to be decreased in cases of leukaemia with elevated levels of IgM, however, it was found to be insignificant (p less than 0.4). The mean IgG, IgA and IgM levels were found to be almost identical in different leukaemia irrespective of cytological types except in 2 cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia which showed low levels of IgG and IgA. The mean levels of IgG and IgA were found to be significantly decreased in malignant lymphoma (p less than 0.02). IgM levels were found to be increased in 3 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Interferon-alpha (IFN) is known to promote graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo BMT). This property may also be used to enhance a graft-versus-leukaemia effect (GVL) after donor leucocyte infusion (DLI), a mode of therapy increasingly offered to patients relapsing after allo BMT. AIM: The aims of the present study were to examine the efficacy and toxicity of IFN therapy administered after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-stimulated blood cells given as DLI in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) and multiple myeloma relapsing after allo BMT. METHODS: Between October 1996 and September 1999, 27 patients (16 AML, four ALL, three CML, three multiple myeloma, one AUL) who relapsed after allo BMT were treated with chemotherapy followed by DLI, collected after G-CSF stimulation in all but two cases. Subsequently, IFN was given to patients without significant GVHD or rapidly progressive disease. The outcome after DLI with regard to remission rate, disease-free survival and GVHD was analysed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients received IFN following DLI, 14 of whom developed significant GVHD (grade II-IV acute or extensive chronic); thereafter, GVHD resolved with cessation of IFN alone in four patients, but 10 required systemic immunosuppression. Twenty-three patients were given chemotherapy and DLI as initial treatment of relapse; 10 achieved complete remission (CR), in four patients this was only after the onset of GVHD. The other four patients received chemotherapy and DLI as a consolidation of a chemotherapy-induced remission. The CR was durable only in patients with CML (3 of 3) and AML (4 of 8). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IFN induced GVHD in the majority of patients receiving DLI. The induction of GVHD and GVL by this approach produced excellent results in patients with CML and modest results in AML, but appeared to be less effective in myeloma and ALL.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease in which prognosis is determined by cytogenetic and molecular aberrations as well as patient-related factors, including age, prior haematologic disorders, and comorbidities. Despite the diverse disease biology, the standard of care for remission induction therapy has changed very little since its inception in 1973. Next generation sequencing has helped to increase our knowledge of the disease pathogenesis, allowing us to develop targeted and possibly more effective treatment options. Seven new agents have been approved for the treatment of AML since 2017, all of which are directed toward a specific molecular subtype or patient population. With the advent of these therapies, a more optimal, patient-specific approach rather than the historical 'one-size fits all' model can be utilised. This review will discuss the role of these novel therapies in the remission induction setting.\n",
      "Acute leukaemia is the commonest form of malignancy in childhood. The coincidental development of leukaemia in children or adults with haemophilia is extremely rare, although cases of leukaemia and other malignancies have been reported previously in HIV-positive subjects. Of a total of 440 people with haemophilia registered with our society, two were diagnosed with acute leukaemia last year. The development of leukaemia in a subject with haemophilia has previously been reported from our country in 1985, but the negative HIV status of these recent cases is very interesting. The first case involved a 14-year-old boy with moderate haemophilia A, who developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) [French-American-British (FAB) classification L2]. The second subject was a 16-year-old boy who had moderately severe haemophilia A with no previous family history, and developed acute nonlymphocytic (myelomonocytic) leukaemia (FAB-M4). Both patients received conventional chemotherapy and this report discusses the potential problems in management of such cases, including diagnosis and administration of chemotherapy in subjects with a pre-existing haemorrhagic disorder. Extensive cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, as well as bleeds in joints previously affected by haemarthrosis and alterations of haematological values were all initially suggestive of the development of inhibitors against factor VIII, but the appearance of blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow led to the definitive diagnosis. The risk of bleeding, due to the combination of both leukaemia and the consequences of the chemotherapy, was overcome by the administration of coagulation factor concentrates (daily initially followed by prophylactic doses after successful induction of remission in both patients). The young patient with ALL is now receiving the maintenance phase of the Children Cancer Study Group 1961 protocol and is in the 15th month of follow-up, without any complications. The other case relapsed in the seventh month, developing enterobacter sepsis, and died. An important lesson to be learnt from these cases is that the possible diagnosis of leukaemia should not be overlooked in a patient with haemophilia and severe haemorrhagic problems, if the first-line differential diagnosis of inhibitor development against factor VIII (or IX) has been excluded.\n",
      "We have investigated the diagnostic value of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to detect t(11;14) and trisomy 12 in 53 cases with a B cell leukaemia difficult to classify on clinical and laboratory grounds. These cases were initially diagnosed by morphology and immunophenotype and in 33 of them, on tissue histology, as follows: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 20, 18 of them with atypical features; B cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-PLL), two; mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), 15; splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL), five; lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, six; follicular lymphoma, one and, four cases remained unclassifiable. FISH demonstrated BCL-1 rearrangement in the circulating cells from 15 cases classified as: MCL (10), atypical CLL (three) and B-PLL (two). A definitive diagnosis of MCL was made on review of the spleen histology in one out of the three atypical CLL with BCL-1 rearrangement. Trisomy 12 was detected in eight cases which included four atypical CLL, one typical CLL, two MCL and one unspecified B cell lymphoma by histology and morphology. One of the MCL had both trisomy 12 and BCL-1 rearrangement and the other was CD5+, CD23+ and had a CLL score of 3, suggesting the latter diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate that FISH analysis is useful to clarify the nature of the disease in patients presenting with a B cell leukaemia in which the diagnosis is difficult by conventional methods. FISH established with certainty the diagnosis of MCL by showing BCL-1 rearrangement in over two-thirds of cases in which this was suspected, including blastoid forms, and confirmed the diagnosis of most cases of atypical CLL.\n",
      "This paper considers theoretical models for early-onset childhood leukaemia. The major focus of attention is the two-hit mutational model. A simple mathematical representation is used to explore mechanisms which might lead to onset of leukaemia at an unusually early age. Two such mechanisms are considered. The first of these, a germinal or very early embryonic first mutation is shown to imply that multiple independent leukaemic clones are likely to arise sequentially in very young patients. Clonal multiplicity could underlie the poor prognosis which has been associated with early onset childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It implies that curative therapy might require intensive treatment followed by bone marrow rescue to ensure eradication of all single-hit predisposed target cells. The prediction of multiple leukaemic clones might be tested in female patients by means of X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms and in patients with B-lineage neoplasms by determination of immunoglobin gene rearrangements. A second mechanism for early onset leukaemogenesis is the occurrence of a high cellular mutation rate in some patients. This is shown to result in leukaemia at significantly earlier age if the mutation rate is sufficiently high to influence target cell loss rate. This mechanism would enable more rapid clonal evolution of leukaemic cells and the early emergence of drug resistant variants. The prediction might be tested experimentally by sequential observation of genetic markers (e.g. Karyotypes, DNA fingerprint patterns) and the rate of emergence of drug resistant phenotypes. Other models, considered more briefly, include one-hit mutational 'dominants' in the developing embryo and faster growth kinetics in neoplasms of younger patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "Current leukaemia therapy focuses on increasing chemotherapy efficacy. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been proposed for carrying and delivery drugs to improve killing of cancer cells. We have shown that MSCs loaded with Paclitaxel (PTX) acquire a potent anti-tumour activity. We investigated the effect of human MSCs (hMSCs) and mouse SR4987 loaded with PTX (hMSCsPTX and SR4987PTX) on MOLT-4 and L1210, two leukaemia cell (LCs) lines of human and mouse origin, respectively. SR4987PTX and hMSCsPTX showed strong anti-LC activity. hMSCsPTX, co-injected with MOLT-4 cells or intra-tumour injected into established subcutaneous MOLT-4 nodules, strongly inhibited growth and angiogenesis. In BDF1-mice-bearing L1210, the intraperitoneal administration of SR4987PTX doubled mouse survival time. In vitro, both hMSCs and hMSCsPTX released chemotactic factors, bound and formed rosettes with LCs. In ultrastructural analysis of rosettes, hMSCsPTX showed no morphological alterations while the attached LCs were apoptotic and necrotic. hMSCs and hMSCsPTX released molecules that reduced LC adhesion to microvascular endothelium (hMECs) and down-modulated ICAM1 and VCAM1 on hMECs. Priming hMSCs with PTX is a simple procedure that does not require any genetic cell manipulation. Once the effectiveness of hMSCsPTX on established cancers in mice is proven, this procedure could be proposed for leukaemia therapy in humans.\n",
      "Although much work has focused on the elucidation of somatic alterations that drive the development of acute leukaemias and other haematopoietic diseases, it has become increasingly recognized that germline mutations are common in many of these neoplasms. In this Review, we highlight the different genetic pathways impacted by germline mutations that can ultimately lead to the development of familial and sporadic haematological malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Many of the genes disrupted by somatic mutations in these diseases (for example, TP53, RUNX1, IKZF1 and ETV6) are the same as those that harbour germline mutations in children and adolescents who develop these malignancies. Moreover, the presumption that familial leukaemias only present in childhood is no longer true, in large part due to the numerous studies demonstrating germline DDX41 mutations in adults with MDS and AML. Lastly, we highlight how different cooperating events can influence the ultimate phenotype in these different familial leukaemia syndromes.\n",
      "We report two infants with acute basophilic leukaemia associated with a t(X;6)(p11;q23) as the sole abnormality. Morphologic evidence of basophilic lineage was provided by light and electron microscopy. Both patients also had a similar presentation on diagnosis, characterized by clinical signs consistent with a hyperhistaminaemia syndrome, i.e. urticarian rashes and gastro-intestinal disorders evocative of peptic ulcer. Immunophenotypes differed in the two patients, one expressing CD24, CD13 and CD33, whereas only CD117 was found in the other. Basophilic acute leukaemia, a rare group among acute leukaemias, might be nonrandomly associated with a specific chromosomal abnormality, t(X;6)(p11;q23). This new entity might also be identifiable by an uncommon clinical presentation and occurrence in infancy.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common lymphoid malignancy in Western countries, accounting for around a quarter of all leukaemias. Despite a strong familial basis to CLL, with risks in first-degree relatives of CLL cases being increased around sevenfold, the inherited genetic basis of CLL is currently largely unknown. The failure of genetic studies of CLL families to provide support for a major disease-causing locus has suggested a model of susceptibility based on the co-inheritance of multiple low-risk variants, some of which will be common. Recent genome-wide association studies of CLL have vindicated this model of inherited susceptibility to CLL, identifying common variants at multiple independent loci influencing risk. Here we review the evidence for inherited genetic predisposition to CLL and what the currently identified risk loci are telling us about the biology of CLL development.\n",
      "Recently advances have been made in the treatment of acute leukemia in children, it is now possible to cure more than 70% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With the introduction of more intensive chemotherapy regimens in patients at higher risk of relapse and the identification of cases that could be less intensely treated to diminish long-term toxicity, it could be possible to improve these excellent results. In contrast, pediatric acute myeloid leukaemia seems to be a more heterogeneous disease and its response to conventional chemotherapy is not as uniform. Introduction of new and more efficacious therapies is necessary to improve the poor outcome, especially among patients with high-risk features.\n",
      "To determine the influence of advanced age on long-term survival after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), the probability of survival and the frequency of transplantation-associated complications were analysed retrospectively in 20 patients with acute leukaemia (AL) or chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), who were 40-49 years of age (median 44.5 years) at the time of transplant. The results of this patient group were compared to those of 32 patients aged 30-39 years (median 33.5 years) with AL or CML, who also underwent BMT during the same period of time. The overall actuarial survival of the two age groups was comparable with 44% and 41% at 5.9 and 5.6 years, respectively. Patients with standard risk criteria (i.e. HLA-genotypically identical sibling donor, 1st chronic phase of CML or 1st remission of AL) showed a higher probability of survival in both groups (62% at 5.9 years in older patients and 59% at 5.5 years in younger patients, respectively). In contrast, actuarial survival in patients who underwent BMT at an advanced stage of their disease or with marrow from a partially HLA-compatible donor was significantly inferior (P = 0.04). The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease was low in older patients (27%), who received marrow from an HLA-identical sibling donor. The most frequent cause of death was interstitial pneumonia, occurring in seven of the older patients (35%) and in seven of the younger patients (22%). This difference, however, was not statistically significant. Our results indicate that allogenic marrow transplantation in the fifth decade of life might be associated with a tolerable risk of transplantation-related complications. This treatment modality may therefore be regarded as first-line therapy for patients in 1st remission of AL or first chronic phase of CML, who show a normal performance status. The same applies to older patients in advanced stages of disease, since the results are comparable to those achieved in the younger patient group.\n",
      "A case control study was conducted where cases were children younger than 5 years (diseased between 1980 and 2003) registered at the german childhood cancer registry (GCCR). Population-based matched controls (1:3) were selected from the corresponding registrar office. Residential proximity to the nearest nuclear power plant was determined for each subject individually (with a precision of about 25 m). The report is focused on leukaemia and mainly on cases in the inner 5-km zone around the plants. The study includes 593 leukaemia cases and 1,766 matched controls. All leukaemia combined show a statistically significant trend for 1/distance with a positive regression coefficient of 1.75 [lower 95%-confidence limit (CL): 0.65]; for acute lymphoid leukaemia 1.63 (lower 95%-CL: 0.39), for acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia 1.99 (lower 95%-CL: -0.41). This indicates a negative trend for distance. Cases live closer to nuclear power plants than the randomly selected controls. A categorical analysis shows a statistically significant odds ratio of 2.19 (lower 95%-CL: 1.51) for residential proximity within 5 km compared to residence outside this area. This result is largely attributed to cases in previous studies of the GCCR (especially in the inner zone) as there is clearly some overlap between those studies. The result was not to be expected under current radiation-epidemiological knowledge. Considering that there is no evidence of relevant accidents and that possible confounders could not be identified, the observed positive distance trend remains unexplained.\n",
      "We report a case of acute myelomonocytic leukaemia (AMML) who presented with a striking leukaemic infiltration in the frontal area of the scalp that was also rapidly followed by infiltrates in other sites of the skin, mainly in the upper thoracic wall. Leukaemic skin infiltration developed independently of his haematological status; nevertheless, he rapidly progressed to acute leukaemia. We emphasise the importance of early recognition and identification of such lesions with a subsequent early application of systematic antileukaemic therapy.\n",
      "The latest studies suggest that prophylactic chemotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer may increase the leukemia risk in patients. For patients with a low risk for breast cancer recurrence, physicians who make the choice for adjuvant therapy should consider the risk of its long-term side effects. Is the occurrence of lymphatic system cancer and leukemia after breast cancer treatment associated with chemotherapy? Can these types of leukemia be classified as therapy-related leukaemias? We believe that there may be correlations between any diseases, butwe cannot rush to conclusions or dismiss a correlation because we understand little about the diseases themselves.In this paper, we present a case of secondary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and leukemia in patients after breast cancer chemotherapy, it is undeniable that this is a special event. For two distinct tumouroccurrences at different times, we cannot give a clear explanation because of thechanges in the genes that might link them together and we hope to attract the attention of other clinicians.\n",
      "This report summarizes the results of marrow transplantation from HLA-identical siblings and syngeneic twins for treatment of acute myelogenous leukaemia, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic and undifferentiated leukaemia from 1975 until December 1986. Three conditioning regimens and treatment of the marrow graft in vitro with absorbed antithymocyte globulin or the monoclonal antibody \"Campath 1\" for prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) have been studied and analyzed retrospectively. The regimen of total body irradiation in large fractions of 4 Gy and of cyclosphosphamide (200 mg/kg) has achieved the most favorable results. Inactivation of T-cells by treatment of the marrow \"in vitro\" has decreased the severity of GVHD without improving survival. The antileukaemic effect of the graft may be important for control of the disease and may be improved by better immunosuppression of the recipient.\n",
      "Acute leukaemia (AL) is a critical neoplasm of white blood cells. Diagnosing AL requires bone marrow puncture procedure, which many patients do not consent to for it is invasive. Hence sensitive and specific early diagnostic biomarkers are essential for non-invasive diagnosis, new therapeutics and improving the disease prognosis. To differentiate the metabolic alterations associated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), we investigated serum of ALL and AML patients in comparison with two controls using gas chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis. Twenty seven out of 1425 metabolites were found differentiative among ALL, AML, aplastic anaemia (APA) patients and healthy control using p-value ≤ 0.001. ALL is the most dissimilar group from other three groups as in hierarchical clustering showed 72.1% dissimilarity. Model generation using PLSDA gave an overall accuracy of 91.9%. This study helps in metabolic fingerprinting of control and disease serum at high significance levels and could be used for early diagnosing of AL. Based on pathways analysis, fatty acid metabolism is deregulated in patients with AL and may represent an underlying metabolic pathway associated with disease progression.

      "We report the incidence of the chronic lymphoproliferative disorders evolving with leukaemia in Hong Kong. Our findings demonstrate that B cell malignancies are significantly more frequent than mature T cell neoplasms, a picture similar to that seen in Western countries but different from other Eastern countries, eg Japan, where T cell malignancies are more frequent. In contrast to the West, where chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common disorder, in Hong Kong there is a clear predominance of B cell lymphomas in leukaemic phase accounting for two-thirds of the cases and particularly those displaying lymphoplasmacytic features or with villous lymphocytes. CLL in Hong Kong has similar clinical and laboratory features to the disease in patients from the West. Distinct disease categories, rare in the West such as the variant form of hairy cell leukaemia and T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, are also documented. It is unclear whether the differences in prevalence of disease subtypes between Hong Kong and the West relate to different genetic background or environmental factors determinant of the development or progression of the leukaemia. Further studies investigating the genetic/molecular lesions may help to clarify whether the aetiopathogenesis of the lymphoid disorders in Hong Kong is similar to that of Western countries.\n",
      "The clinical features, cytogenetics and response to treatment have been examined in 180 infants (aged <1 year) with acute leukaemia; 118 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 62 with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Comparison of clinical features showed no difference in age or sex distribution between infants with ALL and AML but infants with ALL tended to have higher leucocyte counts at presentation. Cytogenetic abnormalities involving 11q23 were found in 66% of ALL and 35% of AML cases, the commonest, t(4;11) being found only in ALL. The other recognised 11q23 translocations were found in both types of leukaemia. Few patients had the common cytogenetic abnormalities associated with ALL in older children and few with AML had good risk abnormalities. Four year event-free survival 60% cf 30% (P = 0.001) and survival 65% cf 41% (P = 0.007) were significantly better in AML than ALL. These results were due to a lower risk of relapse 27% cf 62% at four years. Superior event-free survival was also seen in the subgroup of patients with 11q23 abnormalities and AML (55% cf 23%). The reasons for superior response in AML are unknown but may be related to the intensity of treatment, lineage of the leukaemia or other as yet unidentified factors.\n",
      "Lymphoid tumours comprise the acute and chronic leukaemias, the broad spectrum of lymphomas, including Hodgkin disease, and multiple myeloma. The subdivision of the acute leukaemias according to the proliferating type of white blood cells has had a major impact on the care of these patients. More recently, specific chromosomal translocations have been used to identify patients who may benefit from more intensive therapies. The novel high-throughput genomic technologies, such as microarrays, provide new avenues for the molecular diagnosis of the haematological malignancies. Rapid advances in genome sequencing and gene expression profiling provide unprecedented opportunities to identify specific genes involved in complex biological processes, including tumorigenesis. The features of microarray technology and the variety of experimental approaches to elucidate lymphoid malignancies are discussed. Microarray technology has the potential to lead to more accurate prognostic assessment for patients and is expected to ultimately allow the clinician to select therapies optimally suited to each patient.\n"

      "Over the last 15 years, infrared (IR) spectroscopy has developed into a novel and powerful biomedical tool that has multiple applications in the field of haematology. By revealing subtle alterations in both the conformation and concentration of key macromolecules, such as DNA, protein and lipids, IR spectroscopy has been employed to investigate multiple aspects of leucocyte physiology. IR spectroscopy has been used, for example, to diagnose and prognose leukaemia; to characterise differentiation and apoptotic processes; to predict drug sensitivity and resistance in leukaemic patients undergoing chemotherapy; to monitor the response of leucocytes to chemotherapy and to perform human leucocyte antigen matching for bone marrow transplant patients. Such studies have provided insight into pathogenic mechanisms underlying specific leucocyte disorders, especially leukaemia. While it is likely to be some considerable time before IR spectroscopy is sufficiently developed to displace the established technologies, IR spectroscopy has the potential to become a valuable analytic tool in basic and clinical haematology.\n",
      "Childhood leukaemia incidence in Costa Rica during 1981-96, among the highest in the world, was analysed by histology, gender, birth year, time period of diagnosis, age at diagnosis and region. Numbers of cases were extracted from the database of the National Cancer Registry (RNT) of Costa Rica. Person-years at risk were calculated from census data and post-census population estimates. During the follow-up, 918 cases of leukaemia in children under 15 years (510 boys, 408 girls) were reported to the RNT (41% of all childhood malignancies), with an overall age-standardised incidence rate of 56 per million person-years. Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) represented 79% and acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) 16% of the cases, with rates of 43 and 9 per million person-years respectively. There were downward trends in incidence of total leukaemias, ALL and ANLL and 'not otherwise specified' (NOS) combined. Incidence of ALL was highest at 1-4 years of age in boys and girls, whereas ANLL peaked in girls during the first year of life. During 1991-96, the decrease in ALL was significant (P = 0.042). A multivariable Poisson regression model identified significant excesses of ALL for boys, for age groups 1-4 and 5-9 years and for three out of seven regions. Possible reasons for the high rates in Costa Rica are discussed.\n",
      "We report the clinical, ultrastructural, immunophenotypic and virological features of nine cases of a rare type of mature T cell disorder formerly designated Sezary cell leukaemia. All patients presented with lymphocytosis ranging from 12.7 to 133 x 10(9)/l, bone marrow infiltration, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Skin involvement was absent at presentation but developed as a terminal event in two patients, one of whom showed a pattern of dermal infiltration different from that characteristic of Sezary syndrome. Cells from eight cases bore a mature T cell phenotype and electronmicroscopy revealed lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei resembling Sezary cells. All cases except one were HTLV-I negative. Patients were treated with various chemotherapy regimens but with poor outcome, the median survival being 13 months. Laboratory and clinical data suggest great similarity between Sezary cell leukaemia and T prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), namely coexpression of CD4 and CD8 (3/9 cases), identical chromosomal abnormalities in the three cases studied (isochromosome 8q plus inversion 14 or t(X;14)(q28;q11)) and a remarkable sensitivity to CAMPATH-1H (complete remission of 21 months' duration in one patient), suggesting that this entity could be considered a variant form of T-PLL. The alternative diagnosis of adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma could not be excluded in one patient in whom positive HTLV-I serology was documented.\n",
      "This review describes the chromosomal abnormalities in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) which result in the over-expression of the gene SCL, which encodes a helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Also described are how gene targeting studies have revealed a key role for SCL in normal haemopoiesis. Next, the BCR-ABL fusion protein, seen in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and in some patients with ALL, is discussed. Finally, the involvement of members of the core-binding factor (CBF) gene family in leukaemogenesis are described. Members of this gene family are involved in the generation of fusion proteins as a result of t(8;21) and inv(16), the most common translocations associated with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). They provide a useful model of the way in which aberrant transcriptional function, brought about through genetic alterations, can modify haemopoietic development.\n",
      "The diagnosis of plasmacytoid dendritic cell leukaemia (pDCL) is based on the immunophenotypic profile: CD4(+) CD56(+) lineage(neg) CD45RA(+)/RO(neg) CD11c(neg) CD116(low) CD123(+) CD34(neg) CD36(+) HLA-DR(+). Several studies have reported pDCL cases that do not express this exact profile or expressing some lineage antigens that could thus be misdiagnosed. This study aimed to validate pDCL-specific markers for diagnosis by flow-cytometry or quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on bone marrow samples. Expression of markers previously found in normal pDC was analysed in 16 pDCL, four pDCL presenting an atypical phenotype (apDCL) and 113 non-pDC - lymphoid or myeloid - acute leukaemia. CD123 was expressed at significantly higher levels in pDCL and apDCL. BDCA-2 was expressed on 12/16 pDCL and on 2/4 apDCL, but was never detected in the 113 non-pDC acute leukaemia cases. BDCA-4 expression was found on 13/16 pDCL, but also in 12% of non-pDC acute leukaemia. High levels of LILRA4 and TCL1A transcripts distinguished pDCL and apDCL from all other acute leukaemia (except B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for TCL1A). We thus propose a diagnosis strategy, scoring first the CD4(+) CD56(+/-) MPO(neg) cCD3(neg) cCD79a(neg) CD11c(neg) profile and then the CD123(high), BDCA-2 and BDCA-4 expression. Atypical pDCL can be also identified this way and non-pDC acute leukaemia excluded: this scoring strategy is useful for diagnosing pDCL and apDCL.\n",
      "Much progress has been made in the clinical, biological and technical aspects of the T-cell-depleted full-haplotype mismatched transplants for acute leukaemia. Our experience demonstrates that infusing a megadose of extensively T-cell-depleted haematopoietic peripheral blood stem cells after an immuno-myeloablative conditioning regimen in acute leukaemia patients ensures sustained engraftment with minimal GvHD without the need of any post-transplant immunosuppressive treatment. Since our first successful pilot study, our efforts have concentrated on developing new conditioning regimens, optimising the graft processing and improving the post-transplant immunological recovery. The results we have so far achieved in more than 200 high-risk acute leukaemia patients show that haploidentical transplantation is now a clinical reality. Because virtually all patients have a mismatched family member, who is immediately available, mismatched transplantation should be offered as a viable option to high-risk acute leukaemia patients who do not have, or cannot find, a matched donor.\n",
      "We present a congenital leukaemia with a mixed phenotype of megakaryoblasts and erythroblasts. A newborn male with exopthalmus and multiple skin nodules, had bone marrow blasts which expressed CD41b, CD42b, glycophorin-A and haemoglobin, but monocyte or lymphoid markers were negative. The patient achieved a complete remission with chemotherapy. Blasts cultured for a few months expressed erythroid markers but lost the megakaryocytic phenotype, although addition of phorbol ester induced the latter phenotype. Spontaneous colony formation was observed in semi-solid culture and the number of colonies was increased by erythropoietin. Detailed studies further indicated the heterogeneity of congenital leukaemia.\n",
      "Leukaemia is rare in infancy with an equal predominance of lymphoblastic and myeloblastic cases. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in infants under one year is characterised by a high leucocyte count, organomegaly, early B-cell phenotype, sometimes with evidence of monocytoid differentiation and cytogenetic abnormalities. This is reflected in its poor prognosis. The toddler (aged 1-2) tends to develop typical childhood ALL which is responsive to treatment, but remains vulnerable to late effects of therapy, particularly radiation. The distribution of subtypes of AML differs in the younger and older child and results of treatment have improved in all age groups. A uniform strategy appears desirable for all cases of childhood AML. It seems probable that different genetic and environmental factors may be involved in the genesis of infant ALL, childhood ALL and AML in children. The management of leukaemia in children under two poses a considerable challenge.\n",
      "Four women and three men after allogeneic (n=4) and autologous (n=3) haematopoietic SCT (HSCT) were observed to have an increase in T-cell large granular lymphocytes (T-LGLs) of CD3+CD8+ phenotype for a median of 41 (15-118) months. Clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene was verified by two PCR techniques and direct DNA sequencing, confirming that the cases were neoplastic and therefore classifiable as T-LGL leukaemia. In the allogeneic HSCT cases, T-LGL leukaemia was derived from donor T cells in three patients, as shown by DNA chimerism analysis, and recipient T cells in one patient who had graft failure previously. None of the patients showed cytopenia, autoimmune phenomenon or organ infiltration, which were features typical of de novo T-LGL leukaemia. Six patients had remained asymptomatic with stable large granular lymphocyte counts. One patient died from cerebral relapse of the original lymphoma. T-LGL leukaemias occurring post-HSCT are distinct from de novo T-LGL leukaemia and may have a different pathogenesis and clinical course. Patients did not require specific treatment, and the disease remained stable for long periods.\n",
      "The EUROCLUS project included information on residence at diagnosis for 13351 cases of childhood leukaemia diagnosed in the period 1980-89 in defined geographical regions in 17 countries. A formal algorithm permits identification of small census areas as containing case excesses. The present analysis examines spatial-temporal patterns of the cases (n = 970) within these clustered areas. The objectives were, first, to compare these results with those from an analysis conducted for UK data for the period 1966-83, and, second, to extend them to consider infant leukaemias. A modification of the Knox test investigates, within the small areas, temporal overlap between cases in a subgroup of interest at a putative critical time and all other cases at any time between birth and diagnosis. Critical times were specified in advance as follows: for cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia aged 2-4 years, the 18-month period preceding diagnosis; for cases of total leukaemia aged 5-14 years, 1 year before to 1 year after birth; and for infant cases (diagnosed < 1 year), 1 year before to 6 months after birth. Each of the analyses found evidence of excess space-time overlap compared with that expected; these were 10% (P = 0.005), 15% (P= 0.0002) and 26% (P= 0.03) respectively. The results are interpreted in terms of an infectious origin of childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "The United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study was designed to examine the potential aetiological role of a range of perinatal and reproductive factors. Our use of clinical records permitted a more exact characterisation of reproductive events than is possible in investigations that rely on self-reporting; and the increased specificity with which antecedent events were measured produced more precise risk estimates, albeit ones based on progressively smaller numbers. Information on the conduct of this component of the study and results for 1485 children with haematological malignancies and 4864 controls are presented. The 'find' rate for obstetric records was high at 86% for cases, with 81% having information on both matched controls. Associations were seen for severe hyperemesis (Odds Ratio=3.6, 95%Confidence Interval=1.3-10.1, for all leukaemias), polyhydramnios (OR=4.0, 95%CI=1.5-10.3, for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)), anaemia (haemoglobin <10 g, OR=2.6, 95%CI=1.7-4.1, for AML), and pre-eclampsia (OR=1.7, 95%CI=1.1-2.7, for non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Babies who developed leukaemia were heavier at birth (>4000 g, OR=1.2, 95%CI=1.0-1.4), as were their older siblings (>4000 g, OR=1.4, 95%1.0-1.9). Mothers' whose children developed common B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were more likely to have had a previous molar pregnancy (OR=5.2, 95%CI=1.9-14.7). Gender-specific analysis revealed that findings often differed markedly for boys and girls; and, in common with other reports, strong associations with Down syndrome were seen for both ALL and AML.\n",
      "Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules have been considered as a good target molecule for use in immunotherapy, because of the high expression in some lymphoma and leukaemia cells and, also, because of their restricted expression on human cells (monocytes, dendritic, B lymphocytes, thymic epithelial cells, and some cytokine-activated cells, such as T lymphocytes). We have obtained a human IgM monoclonal antibody directed against human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules, using transgenic mice carrying human Ig genes. The antibody BH1 (IgM/kappa isotype) recognises HLA-class II on the surface of tumour cells from patients suffering from haematological malignancies, such as chronic and acute lymphocytic leukaemias, non-Hodgkin lymphomas and myeloid leukaemias. Interestingly, functional studies revealed that BH1 mAb recognises and kills very efficiently tumour cells from several leukaemia patients in the presence of human serum as a source of complement. These results suggest that this human IgM monoclonal antibody against HLA-class II could be considered as a potential agent in the treatment of several malignancies.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood cancers are at risk of developing subsequent primary leukaemias (SPLs), but the long-term risks beyond 20 years of treatment are still unclear. We investigated the risk of SPLs in five-year childhood cancer survivors using a large-scale pan-European (PanCareSurFup) cohort and evaluated variations in the risk by cancer and demographic factors. METHODS: This largest-ever assembled cohort comprises 69,460 five-year childhood cancer survivors from 12 European countries. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen survivors developed an SPL including 86 myeloid leukaemias (subsequent primary myeloid leukaemias [SPMLs]), 17 lymphoid leukaemias and 12 other types of leukaemias; of these SPLs, 31 (27%) occurred beyond 20 years from the first childhood cancer diagnosis. Compared with the general population, childhood cancer survivors had a fourfold increased risk (SIR = 3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.1 to 4.5) of developing leukaemia, and eight leukaemias per 100,000 person-years (AER = 7.5, 95% CI: 6.0 to 9.2) occurred in excess of that expected. The risks remained significantly elevated beyond 20 years from the first primary malignancy (SIR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.6 to 3.4). Overall, the risk ratio for SPML (SIR = 5.8, 95% CI: 4.6 to 7.1) was higher than that for other SPLs. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that beyond 20 years after childhood cancer diagnosis, survivors experience an increased risk for SPLs compared with that expected from the general population. Our findings highlight the need for awareness by survivors and their healthcare providers for potential risk related to SPL.\n",
      "Intense myelofibrosis is rarely associated with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) except in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AML-M7) where there is diffuse marrow fibrosis as a consequence of proliferation of neoplastic myeloid cells. AML associated with significant myelofibrosis developing both de novo or secondary to primary (idiopathic) myelofibrosis is characterised by a fulminant course and extremely poor prognosis, primarily due to treatment-resistant disease. The prognostic value of degree of marrow fibrosis in de novo AML has been poorly investigated. We describe a case of extensive myelofibrosis associated with acute erythroblastic leukaemia (AML-M6) that responded to induction therapy of the leukaemia.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and the potential effects of the Haematological Home Care (HHC) programme for acute leukaemia (AL) patients, either in active chemotherapy or in the terminal phase of disease. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed a group of AL patients assisted at home in terms of number of hospitalisations, accesses to emergency department and place of death. We also used historical data to evaluate potential effects of HHC. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 44 patients, 36 of whom (82%) required palliative treatment, and eight (18%) had ongoing active chemotherapy. The mean number of hospitalisations was 0.64 (range 0-7) per patient, and the number of emergency department (ED) visits was 0.82 (range 0-4) per patient. Place of death was at home for 51.4% of patients and in hospital for 40.5%. Considering a historical group of 17 patients assisted at home the rate of hospitalisations and ED visits were 2.53 (range 0-9) and one (range 0-3), respectively. Place of death was home and hospital in 6% and 65%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Haematological Home Care for AL patients is feasible and has potential positive effects in terms rate of hospitalisations and place of death.\n",
      "CD4+ and CD8+ TCR alpha beta+ T-cell clones were derived from 4 leukaemia patients early (4-6 weeks) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) secretion in response to the activation signal accessory cells (AC) + phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) was investigated for each individual clone. Only a minority of CD4+ TCR alpha beta+ T-cell clones secreted LIF in response to AC + PHA, whereas most T-cell clones were capable of LIF secretion when exogenous interleukin 2 was added together with AC + PHA. LIF secretion could also be demonstrated for CD8+ TCR alpha beta+ posttransplant T-cell clones. Thus, posttransplant CD4+ and CD8+ TCR alpha beta+ clonogenic T-cells are capable of LIF secretion, and LIF secretion may be a T-cell effector mechanism in graft versus host disease, graft versus leukaemia effects or posttransplant haematopoietic reconstitution.\n",
      "Demonstration of either the translocation t(15;17)(q22;q21) or the fusion of PML and RARalpha genes is regarded as diagnostic for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) of FAB type M3, but has occasionally been seen in other FAB types. We present two such cases. Case 1 presented with FAB type M6 and a complex karyotype involving chromosomes 1, 2, 11 and 17. Bone marrow relapse of FAB type M3 followed autologous bone marrow transplantation. Subsequent marrow dysplasia and an M6 relapse were accompanied by a new cytogenetic clone involving chromosomes X, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 16. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of metaphase chromosomes at diagnosis showed insertion of material from chromosome 17 into a 'normal' 15 with juxtaposition of PML and RARalpha. Case 2 presented as AML M4 and relapsed as M3. Cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis and in relapse showed 46,XY,t(15;17)(q22;q11),del(16)(q22). FISH analysis showed this to be a three-way translocation involving chromosomes 15, 16 and 17 again with juxtaposition of PML and RARalpha. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed PML/RARalpha fusion at diagnosis, in remission and in first relapse. These examples strengthen the case for RT-PCR screening of all AML patients for these fusion genes.\n",
      "Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is most common in adults and is associated with poor prognosis. Since karyotypic identification of the Philadelphia translocation has been hampered by technical difficulties, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to look for the BCR-ABL rearrangement in stored samples from a selected group of 314 German ALL patients. BCR-ABL transcripts were found in 77 of 179 adults and were restricted to those with B-precursor leukaemias. 55% of adult common ALL patients had BCR-ABL and its presence correlated with poor overall survival and remission duration. Of 135 children with common ALL, 5 (6%) primary cases and 8 (17%) with recurrent neoplasias were PCR-positive. We recommend prospective evaluation of BCR-ABL analysis with PCR in patients with a B-precursor leukaemia.\n",
      "Clinical findings leading to the diagnosis of acute leukaemia result from the consequences of both pancytopenia and tumoral manifestations. Although leukaemic infiltration of hematopoietic organs is common, the involvement of non-hematopoietic abdominal organs remains rare. The authors report a series of six cases, where intra-abdominal localization of acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukaemia was detected at diagnosis or relapse. Chemotherapy may lead to remission or cure if the early abdominal complications are managed with care.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) down-regulation by preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) is a general phenomenon in different types of solid tumours, but research on the correlation between PRAME and TRAIL gene expression in leukaemia patients is rare. METHOD: PRAME and TRAIL expression was detected in bone marrow samples from 80 newly diagnosed acute leukaemia (AL) patients and 40 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients using TaqMan-based real-time quantitative PCR methods, and a linear correlation analysis was performed on their levels of expression. A total of 15 normal bone marrow samples from individuals with non-malignant haematological diseases served as normal controls. RESULTS: PRAME expression was higher in both AL and CML patients compared to controls (both p < 0.001). CML patients in both blast crisis (BC) and the accelerated phase (AP) had significantly higher PRAME levels than CML patients in the chronic phase (CP) (p = 0.006 and 0.0461, respectively). TRAIL expression was higher in both the acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) group and the acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) group than in the controls (p = 0.039 and 0.047, respectively). In contrast, CML patients had lower TRAIL levels than controls (p = 0.043), and TRAIL expression in CML patients in the advanced phases (BC and AP) was significantly lower than in CML-CP patients (p = 0.006). In CML patients, there was a significant inverse correlation (Spearman R = -0.6669, p < 0.0001) between PRAME and TRAIL gene expression, while a greater significant inverse correlation was found in patients in the advanced phases (BC and AP) (R = -0.6764). In addition, no correlation was observed in AML and ALL patients. CONCLUSION: The simultaneous detection of PRAME and TRAIL gene expression may be helpful to monitor condition changes in leukaemia patients and evaluate therapeutic effects in clinical practice, particularly in CML patients.\n",
      "In patients presenting with immature eosinophilic precursors it is notoriously difficult to distinguish acute eosinophilic leukaemia (EoL) from the benign idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), based on morphological, cytochemical and immunophenotyping criteria, alone. Cytogenetic analysis or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can help in discriminating between these rare haematological disorders, but often treatment decisions cannot wait for the results of these time-consuming techniques. Recently, we and others found Wilms' tumour (WT1) gene expression to be increased in virtually all patients with acute leukaemias, whereas normal haemopoietic progenitors express the WT1 gene at much lower levels or not at all. To determine whether detection of WT1 gene expression is useful to distinguish EoL from HES patients, we analysed, by RT-PCR, bone marrow or blood mononuclear cells from EoL (n=3), HES (n=3) and reactive eosinophilia patients (n = 4) for WT1 gene expression. Using our WT1-RT-PCR protocol, we found WT1 gene expression to be restricted to EoL patients. By detecting WT1 mRNA transcripts in the cerebrospinal fluid using RT-PCR, we were also able to diagnose isolated CNS-relapsed leukaemia, initially confused with bacterial meningitis, in an EoL patient. In conclusion, we show that WT1-RT-PCR is a powerful complementary diagnostic tool to distinguish acute eosinophilic leukaemia from the hypereosinophilic syndromes. This observation needs confirmation in a larger series of EoL and HES patients.\n",
      "In order to assess the systemic prognosis of children with leukaemic ocular involvement, 63 of 131 patients admitted to hospital with acute leukaemia were evaluated ophthalmically. A total of 28 of 63 showed ophthalmic involvement and were followed up for up to 84 months. Twenty seven of 28 patients (96.4%) died within 28 months after the onset of ocular involvement and within 83 months after the onset of leukaemia. The 5 year survival rate of patients with ophthalmic manifestations was 21.4% (6/28). This survival rate was significantly lower than that of those who lacked ophthalmic manifestations (16/35: 45.7%, p < 0.05). All of the patients with ophthalmic manifestations had either bone marrow relapse or central nervous system leukaemia. The prognosis was related to risk factors such as central nervous system leukaemia or bone marrow relapse in most cases.\n",
      "We studied the distribution of ABO blood groups in Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, in children up to the age of 12 years, in a hospital-based retrospective study. Blood group data were recorded from the case records of all the patients in a tertiary care centre with the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, during the period 1987-1997. There were 63 Hodgkin lymphoma, 78 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 116 acute myeloid leukaemia and 522 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients. We assessed the distribution of ABO blood groups and the difference in the distribution from the source population. In Hodgkin lymphoma, there were 45.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.8-84.5] more patients with B blood group. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, there were 14.3% (95% CI: 3.2-25.2) more patients with O blood group. In Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients, there were 56.5% (95% CI: 19.9-85.4) and 52.9% (95% CI: 18.1-82.6) less patients with A blood group, respectively. This shows that the relationship between the ABO blood groups and haematological malignancies merits further investigation in a population-based prospective study. This is the first study of its kind in any Indian population.\n",
      "Autonomous production of a required growth factor is one mechanism by which a cell may become tumorigenic. Several leukaemias have been described which secrete growth factors which may be involved in autocrine stimulation of cell proliferation. One of these leukaemias is WEHI-3B, a myelomonocytic leukaemia that constitutively produces interleukin-3 (IL-3). Cloning of the IL-3 gene has enabled us to investigate possible genetic changes in this gene in WEHI-3B cells which may have resulted in autonomous production of growth factor. We have shown that one of the IL-3 genes in WEHI-3B has been rearranged, as a result of the insertion of a 5.1 kilobase intracisternal A-type particle genome head to head with the 5' end of the IL-3 gene, 215 bases upstream of the IL-3 TATA box. The rearranged gene, when cloned into a lambda EMBL3A vector, could readily be expressed in COS-1 monkey cells, whereas the normal gene, in the same vector, was silent. Thus the insertion of the endogenous retroviral element has resulted in abnormal expression of the IL-3 gene and is postulated to have been a key genetic change in the development of this leukaemia. In an attempt to experimentally construct IL-3 producing leukaemias, IL-3 responsive FDC-P1 and 32D cl-23 cells were transfected with a retroviral expression vector containing the IL-3 gene. This resulted in autonomous production of IL-3 and continuous proliferation of the transfected cells. As a result of transfection, the FDC-P1 and 32D cl-23 cells became leukemogenic demonstrating the oncogenic potential of abnormal expression of IL-3. The autocrine nature of the experimental leukaemias was demonstrated by blocking their proliferation with an IL-3 neutralising antiserum. Similarly treated cultures of normal bone marrow cells also produced IL-3 and could be maintained for several months after transfection but were not leukemogenic. The factor-dependent cell lines are unable to differentiate in the presence of known CSF and presumably have undergone other genetic changes which allow them to become leukemogenic when autocrine-stimulated. In contrast, the transfected bone marrow cells could differentiate and form colonies containing mature granulocytes and macrophages. The non-tumorigenic behaviour of the transfected bone marrow cells is consistent with the concept that several other genetic changes which effectively block differentiation are required for development of tumorigenicity in these cells.\n",
      "Infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) represents a rare but unique subset with poor prognosis. We analysed mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene rearrangements and the sequences of complete and incomplete immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements (IGH) in 14 infants (age < or = 12 months at diagnosis) enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 95-01. The dynamics of the leukaemic clone were followed during the course of the disease by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of IGH rearrangements. Sixteen sequences were obtained from 13 (93%) of these infants. There was marked over usage of the V(H)6.1 gene segment (64%) in infants compared with older children with ALL (8%), (P < 0.001) and overusage of D(H)6 (P = 0.004) and J(H)1 (P = 0.004). Poor outcome was associated with MLL gene rearrangements rather than any specific V(H)D(H)J(H) gene usage patterns. Levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction appeared to be high in infants with ALL compared with older children, and although the number of infant cases studied was small, there were no differences in MRD levels after induction therapy in infant ALL with or without MLL gene rearrangements (P = 0.41) and quantitative MRD assessment at the early time points may not be predictive of outcome. Novel treatment strategies are required to improve the outcome in this poor prognosis subset of children with ALL.\n",
      "The multistep development of haematopoietic malignancies, like other neoplasms, reflects sequential mutations that either activate proto-oncogenes or disrupt tumour suppressor genes. In a few spontaneous leukaemias or lymphomas, more than one mutation has now been identified, and the experimental analysis of oncogene co-operation is advancing rapidly via retroviral gene delivery and characterization of transgenic mice bearing oncogenes. In transgenic models, tumorigenesis can be accelerated by introducing another oncogene or by using a retrovirus as an insertional mutagen to identify cellular genes that collaborate with the transgene. Leukaemogenesis can be promoted by some ten pairs of oncogenes. The myc nuclear oncoprotein, for example, can collaborate with cytoplasmic oncoproteins such as ras, raf, bcl-2, pim-1 and v-abl, as well as with nuclear products such as bmi-1 or the tumour suppressor p53. The genes in such partnerships seem to provide complementary functions. For example, myc seems to prevent cells from becoming quiescent, whereas bcl-2 blocks programmed cell death; and others, for example ras, may diminish growth factor requirements. The products of genes that collaborate may lie on separate signal transduction pathways, leading to distinct nuclear targets. Key targets are postulated to be regulators of the cell cycle, especially the cyclins and associated kinases that govern progression in the G1 phase.\n",
      "The simultaneous occurrence of acute myeloid leukaemia with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia is extremely rare. We report a case of a 74-year-old man who was evaluated for macrocytic anaemia. Based on the morphology and immunophenotyping analysis of peripheral blood, a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was established. Subsequently, the bone marrow examination revealed the presence of two distinct, coexisting CLL and AML clones. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis detected deletion 13q14.3 and unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain in the CLL clone, only. The AML and CLL clones did not share clonality, and the AML did not involve the peripheral blood. A diagnosis of cytogenetically normal de novo AML occurring concurrently with untreated CLL has not been reported previously in English literature.\n",
      "Three hundred and six patients with low- and intermediate-risk leukaemias undergoing allogeneic BMT between 1980 and March 1996 were studied regarding transplantation-related mortality (TRM), relapse, and leukaemia-free survival (LFS). Among the patients were 262 recipients of marrow from HLA-identical siblings and 44 patients receiving marrow from HLA-A, -B, and -DR identical unrelated donors. Between 1986 and 1993, 153 adult patients received ciprofloxacin continuously during Cy conditioning, but since November 1993 ciprofloxacin has not been given until after Cy treatment. TRM at 5 yr showed an incidence of 30%. Significant risk factors in Cox regression multivariate analysis comprised acute GVHD grades II-IV (p < 0.0001), seropositivity for 3-4 herpes viruses prior to BMT (p = 0.002), intermediate risk disease (p = 0.008), female donor to male recipient (p = 0.015), and a donor age over 17 yr (p = 0.025). The risk of relapse was studied from 90 d after BMT, and the overall 5-yr incidence was 32%. Significant risk factors comprised acute leukaemia, as compared to CML (p = 0.003), total body irradiation (TBI) compared to busulphan treatment (p = 0.011), gram-negative prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin during cyclophosphamide (Cy) conditioning (p = 0.024), GVHD prophylaxis using a combination of methotrexate (MTX) and cyclosporine (CSA), compared to monotherapy (p = 0.037) and absence of chronic GVHD (p = 0.050). The 5-yr probability of relapse in patients receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis during Cy conditioning was 40%, compared to 24% in patients not receiving this treatment (p = 0.01). Overall, LFS at 5 yr was 49%. LFS was evaluated from day 30 after BMT until relapse or death of the patient. We found no difference in TRM, relapse or LFS between recipients of HLA-identical sibling or unrelated bone marrow, risk factors significantly associated with an inferior LFS included acute GVHD grades II-IV (p = 0.0002), intermediate risk disease (p = 0.003), donor seropositivity for 3-4 herpes viruses (p = 0.046), and TBI conditioning (p = 0.048).\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Coffee and tea are the most frequently consumed beverages in the world. Their potential effect on the risk of developing different types of malignancies has been largely investigated, but studies on leukaemia in adults are scarce. METHODS: The present investigation is aimed at evaluating the potential role of regular coffee and tea intake on the risk of adult leukaemia by reanalysing a large population based case-control study carried out in Italy, a country with a high coffee consumption and a low use of green tea. Interviewed subjects, recruited between 1990 and 1993 in 11 Italian areas, included 1771 controls and 651 leukaemia cases. Association between Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), Acute Lymphoid Leukaemia, Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia, Chronic Lymphoid Leukaemia, and use of coffee and tea was evaluated by standard logistic regression. Odds Ratios (OR) were estimated adjusting for the following potential confounders: gender, age, residence area, smoking habit, educational level, previous chemotherapy treatment, alcohol consumption and exposure to electromagnetic fields, radiation, pesticides and aromatic hydrocarbons. RESULTS: No association was observed between regular use of coffee and any type of leukaemia. A small protective effect of tea intake was found among myeloid malignancies, which was more evident among AML (OR=0.68, 95%CI: 0.49-0.94). However, no clear dose-response relation was found. CONCLUSION: The lower risk of leukaemia among regular coffee consumers, reported by a few of previous small studies, was not confirmed. The protective effect of tea on the AML risk is only partly consistent with results from other investigations.\n",
      "A semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to investigate and compare transcription levels of the human multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) and the recently described multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) in 105 samples from patients with acute leukaemia at presentation and relapse. MRP gene expression was significantly greater in samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) compared with samples from normal peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) and patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). MRP gene expression was found to be higher in patients with relapsed de novo AML compared to those at presentation but prior therapy did not affect MRP gene expression in ALL. MDR1 gene expression was significantly lower in ALL patients compared to normal PBMC and AML samples. Samples from patients with secondary AML had higher levels of MDR1 expression than those of de novo AML. No changes of MDR1 expression were observed in AML or ALL at relapse. No correlation was observed between MDR1 and MRP gene expression in this group of patients. Our results suggest that MRP expression may be of prognostic importance in AML but the significance of the increased levels we have detected remain unclear.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to review available cohort studies and to estimate quantitatively the association between occupational exposure in plants manufacturing pesticides and leukaemia. METHODS: Following a systematic literature search, relative risks were extracted from 14 studies published between 1984 and 2004. Fixed effect analyses were carried out as heterogeneity between studies was not detected. Meta-analyses were performed on the whole set of data and separate analyses were conducted for specific chemical classes of pesticides as well as type of leukaemia. RESULTS: The meta-rate ratio estimate for all studies was 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.94). After stratification by chemical class, consistent increases in the risk of leukaemia were found in all groups but statistical significance was found only for phenoxy herbicides unlikely to have been contaminated with dioxins and furans. This last finding appears equivocal in view of the existing literature. The separate analysis conducted on leukaemias from the myeloid lineage showed the highest relative risk (6.99; 95% CI 1.96-24.90). There was no obvious indication of publication bias. CONCLUSION: The overall meta-analysis among pesticide manufacturing workers provides quantitative evidence to consider occupational exposure to pesticides as a possible risk factor for leukaemia but available data are too scarce for causality ascertainment. Epidemiological evidence did not allow identifying a specific pesticide or chemical class that would be responsible for the increased risk. Exposure to pesticides may be a significant risk factor for specifically developing myeloid leukaemia and there is a need for additional large well-conducted studies with clear definition of exposure and of leukaemia type(s).\n",
      "Transplantation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) has largely replaced autologous bone marrow transplantation. The same might occur in the allogeneic setting if the favourable initial experience with allogeneic PBPCT is confirmed. We analysed all primary transplants utilizing unmodified PBPC from HLA-identical sibling donors reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) for 1994. 59 patients with a median age of 39 years received myeloablative therapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia (23 patients, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (13), chronic myelogenous leukaemia (nine), lymphoma (seven), or other diagnoses (seven) mostly of advanced stages followed by transplantation of allogeneic PBPC. Three patients died soon after grafting, the others showed prompt haemopoietic recovery with median times to recover an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) above 0.5 and 1.0 x 10(9)/I of 15 (range 9-27) and 17d (range 10-28) respectively. Time to platelet recovery above 20 or 50 x 10(9)/I was 16 (range 9-76) and 18d (range 12-100) respectively. 27 patients (46%) developed no or mild acute graft-versus-host disease (GVIID). The incidence of moderate (grade II) disease was 27%; 24% of the patients developed severe acute GVHD (grades III or IV), 55% of patients who were alive 90d after transplantation developed chronic GVHD, the probability to develop extensive chronic GVHD was 32% (95% confidence interval 22-42) with a median follow-up of 14 months. Overall and event-free survival (EFS) at 1 year were 54% (CI 48-60) and 50% (CI 43-57), respectively, the relapse incidence was 23% (CI 17-29). EFS was 67% (CI 55-79) in patients transplanted for acute leukaemias in first complete remission, chronic myelogenous leukaemia in first chronic phase, or severe aplastic anaemia. Transplantation of allogeneic PBPC resulted in prompt and durable engraftment. The incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD seemed comparable to that observed after allogeneic BMT. Overall and event-free survival in this cohort of patients, most of whom suffered from advanced leukaemia or lymphoma, is encouraging, suggesting that the high numbers of T lymphocytes and/or natural killer cells contained in a typical PBPC collection product exert a vigorous graft-versus-leukaemia effect. Further evaluation of allogeneic PBPCT is highly desirable.\n",
      "Haematological malignancies are a heterogeneous group of diseases with diverse incidence. In Europe, the median age at diagnosis across all disease entities is 69 years. Incidence generally increases with age, reaching a maximum at 75-99 years, with the notable exceptions of Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphocytic leukaemia. Overall survival for patients aged 75 years and older with haematological malignancies is generally poor, particularly for acute leukaemias. Understanding the heterogeneity in outcomes for haematological malignancies, treatment challenges, and management of frailty and comorbidities among older patients could help physicians to better address the haematological cancer burden and mortality in ageing populations. The aim of this Series paper is to provide an updated overview of the knowledge accumulated over the past decade regarding treatment options and broader management considerations in older adults with haematological malignancies, focusing on the most common entities encountered across lymphoma, acute leukaemia, chronic leukaemia, and multiple myeloma disease categories. Future strategies, such as increasing enrolment rates of older adults in clinical trials and incorporating patient-reported outcome measurements in daily clinical practice, will assist in providing more individualised health care.\n",
      "By using a quantitative RNA-RNA solution hybridisation method, the average number of mdr1 RNA transcripts per cell was measured in total nucleic acid extracts of leukaemic cells from patients with acute leukaemia. The results in different types of leukaemia were (number of patients with detectable mdr1 RNA/total number of patients; median number of transcripts per cell in samples with detectable mdr1 RNA); de novo untreated acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML): 20/44; 0.7, secondary acute myelocytic leukaemia: 8/13; 1.1, acute lymphocytic (ALL) and undifferentiated leukaemia: 5/14; 0.6, relapsed leukaemia: 7/15; 0.7. Forty-six patients with de novo untreated acute leukaemia (AML: n = 34, ALL: n = 12) were evaluable for response to induction chemotherapy. Twelve of 18 patients (67%) with detectable mdr1 RNA levels achieved complete remission compared to 23 of 28 (82%) with undetectable levels (P = 0.40). The remission duration tended to be longer among patients with undetectable mdr1 RNA (P = 0.08). Leukaemic cells were analysed on consecutive occasions in 12 patients. The level of expression increased in four and decreased in two. In conclusion, expression of mdr1 RNA is common in acute untreated leukaemia. However, treatment with cytostatic drugs seems only rarely to increase the proportion of leukaemic cells that express mdr1 RNA. Expression of the mdr1 gene could be one of several equally important factors contributing to drug resistance in acute leukaemia.\n",
      "We analysed by immunocytochemistry the expression of p53, bcl-2 and ras proteins in bone marrow blasts from 59 patients with acute leukaemia (AL), 36 myeloid (AML) and 23 lymphoid (ALL), and from 22 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); our aim was to examine if abnormalities in their expression were associated with peculiar biological and clinical findings, or with an altered apoptosis rate, as measured by TUNEL technique. The oncoproteins were expressed with extreme variability, without significant differences among the various morphological or immunological AL subtypes. The mean percentages of bcl-2+ blasts were significantly higher in AML than in MDS (p = 0.01), and in MDS with bone marrow blastosis than in the forms without excess of blasts (p = 0.007). The lowest percentages of apoptotic cells were observed in ALL (mean 1%, p = 0.006), whereas in MDS the apoptotic index was higher (16.7%) than in AML (8.6%) and than in the normal controls (10.8%). but the difference tended to be statistically significant only for cases of refractory anaemia. Whereas in AML and MDS the apoptotic rate was independent of the oncoprotein expression, in ALL there was a significant linear relationship between TUNEL and ras positivity (p = 0.01). Among AML patients treated with intensive polychemotherapy, no differences were observed in oncoprotein expression and apoptotic rate between responders and resistant cases. In conclusion, our data are in agreement with the hypothesis that decreased apoptosis and enhanced cell survival are associated with AL, whereas a high level of apoptosis may be responsible for the ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS; abnormal expression of oncoproteins, even if not strictly related to apoptosis level, may influence disease behaviour.\n",
      "Although myeloid sarcomas (MS) are frequently associated with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the occurrence of mediastinal MS is a much rarer event. The authors describe a distinct group of three AML patients with mediastinal MS and complex cytogenetics presenting at their centre over a 7-year period. Clinical features consistent with superior vena caval obstruction were noted at presentation in two of the three patients. Mediastinal mass was detected on routine chest radiography, and biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of MS. One patient relapsed after consolidation chemotherapy and died from progressive disease. Two patients underwent allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplant, but succumbed to transplant related complications. Review of mediastinal MS over the last 20 years shows that a significant proportion of patients have complex cytogenetic abnormalities and a poor long-term prognosis. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential and patients should be managed along the lines of high risk AML.\n",
      "From the early inception of the transplant models through to contemporary genetic and xenograft models, evolution of murine leukaemic model systems have been critical to our general comprehension and treatment of cancer, and, more specifically, disease states such as acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). However, even with modern advances in therapeutics and molecular diagnostics, the majority of AML patients die from their disease. Thus, in the absence of definitive in vitro models which precisely recapitulate the in vivo setting of human AMLs and failure of significant numbers of new drugs late in clinical trials, it is essential that murine AML models are developed to exploit more specific, targeted therapeutics. While various model systems are described and discussed in the literature from initial transplant models such as BNML and spontaneous murine leukaemia virus models, to the more definitive genetic and clinically significant NOD/SCID xenograft models, there exists no single compendium which directly assesses, reviews or compares the relevance of these models. Thus, the function of this article is to provide clinicians and experimentalists a chronological, comprehensive appraisal of all AML model systems, critical discussion on the elucidation of their roles in our understanding of AML and consideration to their efficacy in the development of AML chemotherapeutics.\n",
      "The treatment of myeloid leukaemia has progressed in recent years with the advent of donor leukocyte infusions (DLI), haemopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) and targeted therapies. However, relapse has a high associated morbidity rate and a method for removing diseased cells in first remission, when a minimal residual disease state is achieved and tumour load is low, has the potential to extend remission times and prevent relapse especially when used in combination with conventional treatments. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are heterogeneous diseases which lack one common molecular target while chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients have experienced prolonged remissions through the use of targeted therapies which remove BCR-ABL(+) cells effectively in early chronic phase. However, escape mutants have arisen and this therapy has little effectivity in the late chronic phase. Here we review the immune therapies which are close to or in clinical trials for the myeloid leukaemias and describe their potential advantages and disadvantages.\n",
      "The aetiology of childhood leukaemia remains largely unknown. Several hypotheses involve environmental exposures that could implicate spatial clustering of cases. The evidence from previous clustering studies is inconclusive. Most of them used areal data and thus had limited spatial resolution. We investigated whether childhood leukaemia tends to cluster in space using exact geocodes of place of residence both at the time of birth or diagnosis. We included 1,871 leukaemia cases diagnosed between 1985 and 2015 at age 0-15 years from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. For each case, we randomly sampled 10 age and sex matched controls from national censuses closest in time. We used the difference of k-functions, Cuzick-Edwards' test and Tango index for point data to assess spatial clustering and Kulldorff circular scan to detect clusters. We separately investigated acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), different age groups at diagnosis (0-4, 5-15 years) and adjusted for multiple testing. After adjusting for multiple testing, we found no evidence of spatial clustering of childhood leukaemia neither around time of birth (p = 0.52) nor diagnosis (p = 0.51). Individual tests indicated spatial clustering for leukaemia diagnosed at age 5-15 years, p k-functions = 0.05 and p Cuzick-Edwards' = 0.04 and a cluster of ALL cases diagnosed at age 0-4 years in a small rural area (p = 0.05). This study provides little evidence of spatial clustering of childhood leukaemia in Switzerland and highlights the importance of accounting for multiple testing in clustering studies.\n",
      "Over the past 60 years, haematologists and scientists from the United Kingdom, notably John Goldman and Tessa Holyoake, have punched above their weight in changing chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) from an incurable and invariably fatal disease for all, to a chronic condition where over 90% have normal life expectancy. As a result, it is now difficult to power a worthwhile phase 3 study for newly diagnosed patients. Nevertheless, important clinical questions remain.\n",
      "Meningioma 1 (MN1) gene overexpression has been reported in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and identified as a negative prognostic factor. In order to characterize patients presenting gene overexpression and to verify if MN1 transcript could be a useful marker for minimal residual disease detection, MN1 was quantified in 136 AML patients with different cytogenetic risk and in 50 normal controls. In 20 patients bearing a fusion gene transcript suitable for minimal residual disease quantitative assessment and in 8 patients with NPM1 mutation, we performed a simultaneous analysis of MN1 and the fusion-gene transcript or NPM1 mutation during follow-up. Sequential MN1 and WT1 analysis was also performed in 13 AML patients lacking other molecular markers. The data obtained show that normal cells consistently express low levels of MN1 transcript. In contrast, high levels of MN1 expression are present in 47% of patients with normal karyotype and in all cases with inv(16). MN1 levels during follow-up were found to follow the pattern of other molecular markers (fusion gene transcripts, NPM1 and WT1). Increased MN1 expression in the BM during follow up was always found to be predictive of an impending hematological relapse.\n",
      "RFM mice were X-irradiated (9.5 Gy) 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 days after inoculation of a transplantable strain-specific myeloid leukaemia (ML) and were reconstituted or not with syngeneic or allogeneic bone marrow cells. Recurrent leukaemia was observed in mice with either type of the bone marrow transplant, indicating that ML cells survived the dose of 9.5 Gy of X-rays. ML cells exposed in vitro to high doses of X-rays (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 Gy) and injected into lethally irradiated syngeneic recipients were still capable of forming leukaemic colonies on the spleens. Higher doses (70, 80, 90 and 100 Gy) abolished the colony formation completely. Irradiated ML cells were also capable of causing leukaemia (hepatosplenomegaly) if inoculated into lethally irradiated CBA mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells of CBA or RFM mice. That was attributed to the release of a leukaemogenic factor from the ML cells, capable of transforming transplanted normal cells.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether there is an excess of leukaemias in 0-15 year old children among those living in close proximity (within 100 m) of a main road or petrol station. METHODS: Data for 0-15 year old children diagnosed between 1990 and 1994 in the United Kingdom West Midlands were used. Postcode addresses were used to locate the point of residence which was compared with proximity to main roads and petrol stations separately, and to both together. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with solid tumours as a control, and incidence ratios (IRs) with population density as a control. RESULTS: The method based on solid tumours as a control showed ORs of 1.61 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.90 to 2.87) and 1.99 (95% CI 0.73 to 5.43), for those living within 100 m of a main road or petrol station respectively. When population was used as a control, the estimated IRs for leukaemia were 1.16 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.72) and 1.48 (95% CI 0.65 to 2.93) for residence within 100 m of a main road or petrol station respectively, but neither reached significance at the 95% level. Results for residence in close proximity to both a main road and petrol station were inconsistent, but there were few. The influence of socioeconomic factors as represented by the Townsend deprivation index on leukaemia incidence was not significant and the results were not explicable on the basis of impact of social class. CONCLUSIONS: The results are suggestive of a small increase in risk of childhood leukaemia, but not solid tumours, for those living in close proximity to a main road or petrol station. This increase in risk is not, however, significant and a larger study is warranted to establish the true risk and causes of any increase in risk.\n",
      "The curability of childhood leukaemia (acute lymphoblastic, acute non lymphoblastic and chronic myeloid) has improved dramatically over the past 25 years. The author reviews the clinical presentations and current therapeutic approaches in broad principle. The importance of supportive care (both at the time of diagnosis and during therapy) and the potential for long-term side effects relevant to adult life are discussed.\n",
      "Cluster of differentiation (CD) antigens are defined when a surface molecule found on some members of a standard panel of human cells reacts with at least one novel antibody, and there is good accompanying molecular data. Monoclonal antibodies to surface CD antigens on leukocytes have been used for flow cytometry, and more recently to construct microarrays that capture live cells. These DotScan microarrays enable the rapid and highly parallel characterization of repertoires of CD antigens whose expression patterns may be correlated with discrete leukaemia subtypes, or used to define biomarker ignatures' for non-hematological diseases. DotScan with fluorescence multiplexing enables profiling of CD antigens for minor subsets of cells, such as colorectal cancer cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes from a surgical sample.\n",
      "The Coulter VCS is an automated differential counter, which derives a five-part differential count on the basis of differences in cell volume, high frequency conductivity and light scatter. A printed scatterplot relating volume and scatter is readily obtained. Other instruments which use automated cytochemistry can distinguish between AML and ALL, and between AML variants. It was our impression that the Coulter VCS might also be capable of such distinction on the basis of the scatterplot patterns. We therefore collected scatterplots produced by Coulter VCS analysis of peripheral blood from 63 patients presenting with acute leukaemia. The scatterplots were inspected and six basic patterns identified. The scatterplots were inspected and six basic patterns identified. The scatterplots could be reproducibly sorted into pattern-specific groups without knowledge of the diagnosis. Precise leukaemic diagnoses were made routinely by conventional morphology, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping. A comparison was then made with the scatterplot patterns. The 51 cases of AML produced examples of all six patterns. The nine cases of ALL produced only three patterns. These were shared with cases of AML, and two were also shared with the three cases of acute mixed lineage leukaemia. Thus, three of the six patterns were specific for AML, whereas no pattern was specific for ALL or acute mixed lineage acute leukaemia. One pattern was produced only by the three cases of AML M6, and another was produced only by five of the 25 cases of primitive (M0 and M1) AML.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "This study assessed whether there is any variation in the incidence of haematological malignancies between geographical areas of differing water supplies in the South West peninsula of the United Kingdom (1984 to 1988 inclusive). The possibility of correlations existing between variation in water quality and variation in the incidence of haematological malignancies was examined. Haematological incidence data, taken from the Leukaemia Research Fund Data Collection Study, were mapped into 46 geographical areas of differing water supply. The distribution of the mapped cases was then tested for homogeneity using the Potthoff and Whittinghill (1966) test score. The age-adjusted incidence ratios calculated during the heterogeneity testing were examined for correlations with water quality indicators using correlation and stepwise regression. Significant heterogeneity in the incidence rates among water supply areas was observed for two groups of disease-acute leukaemias and myeloproliferative disorders. Three water quality indicators-pH, nitrate concentration and aluminium concentration-varied considerably over the study period. Significant correlations were observed between the standardized incidence ratios of five disease categories and some water quality indicators, especially aluminium and trihalomethane concentrations. The standardized incidence ratios of some haematological malignancies differed between geographical areas of water supply in South West England, and the evidence suggests that this variation may be associated with variation in water quality indicators. Although this lends support to similar findings in the United States of America, the pattern of correlations are affected by disease latency and statistical methodology.\n",
      "We reviewed data on 63 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) with leukaemia (n = 16) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, n = 47), splenectomized over a 10-year period. Primary indications for surgery were cytopenia(s) or autoimmune phenomena and progressive or refractory disease with splenomegaly. The spleens removed were on average larger in MCL (median 2.6 kg) than in CLL (1.0 kg). Splenectomy improved the blood counts in 62% of patients with MCL and 47% with stage C CLL, both with cytopenias. The MCL patients showed a decrease in the leucocytosis (medians 60.3-29.1 x 10(9)/l before and after splenectomy), whereas there was an increase in the leucocytosis in CLL (medians 24.2-44 x 10(9)/l). With a median follow up post splenectomy of 10 months (range: < 1-128), 18 patients (four MCL and 14 CLL) have not required further therapy for up to 66 months. We conclude that splenectomy is a useful treatment in MCL and advanced CLL for the correction of cytopenias, reducing the leucocyte count and allowing prolonged periods of clinical remission without therapy. Differences seen between MCL and CLL in spleen size, and in response of the leucocytosis suggest a central role for the spleen in the evolution of MCL with leukaemia.\n",
      "Neoplastic natural killer (NK) cells overexpress Fas ligand (FasL), which may cause damage of Fas-bearing tissues. We report a patient with NK cell leukaemia who developed liver injury after pharyngitis. The NK leukaemic cells expressed functional FasL. In addition to soluble FasL, serum levels of interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma were increased dramatically when liver injury was aggravated. Moreover, hepatocytes expressed Fas and apoptotic hepatocytes were detected in the portal areas. These findings are consistent with the notion that inflammatory cytokines enhance the sensitivity to FasL and trigger apoptosis of hepatocytes in NK cell malignancies.\n",
      "Despite major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of myelogenous leukaemia during the past few decades, this group of diseases remains a serious medical concern with > 15,000 new cases each year and a mortality rate of approximately 10,000 in the US alone. Current available conventional therapies, including chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, often cause severe side effects owing mainly to the lack of specificity of the treatment. In the past years, significant progress has been made towards understanding the pathogenesis of myelogenous leukaemia from the molecular standpoint. To this end, a growing number of approaches are being exploited for the identification and validation of new therapeutic targets suitable for more potent and specific or 'targeted' intervention. In this review, the authors focus their discussion on the four most promising myelogenous leukaemia-associated molecular targets currently being pursued by major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), CD33, farnesyl transferase and BCR-Abl, with emphasis on recent progress on the clinical development of therapeutic agents, including both kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, to these targets.\n",
      "The expression of the multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins may influence the outcome of treatment in patients with acute leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine the IC50 of cytotoxic drugs (cytosine arabinoside, ara-C and daunorubicin, dnr) using the in vitro 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay method. A total of 82 newly diagnosed acute leukemia cases (43 adult myeloid leukaemia, AML cases and 39 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, ALL cases) and 16 relapsed cases (8 AML cases and 8 ALL cases) were studied. The MTS assay was performed using two cytotoxic drugs, dnr and ara-C. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of drugs for 4 days and the IC50 was extrapolated from the viability curve. In newly diagnosed cases, we found that childhood ALL samples showed higher IC50 values of dnr (0.040 +/- 2.320) compared to adult AML samples (0.021 +/- 0.158). In contrast, newly diagnosed adult AML samples showed higher IC50 values of ara-C (0.157 +/- 0.529) compared to childhood ALL samples (0.100 +/- 2.350). In relapsed cases, two samples of childhood ALL showed IC50 values of dnr (0.910 +/- 1.760) and ara-C (1.310 +/- 2.390), which was higher compared to childhood AML samples (0.129 +/- 0.214 and 0.210 +/- 0.003, respectively). However, there was no correlation between IC50 values of these drugs tested with clinical outcome. In conclusion, we found that MTS assay is an easy, rapid and non laborious method to study in vitro drug resistance in acute leukaemia cases.\n",
      "It is generally considered that most cancers arise following the accumulation of several genetic events and that as a consequence its incidence increases with age. We report a cytogenetic subgroup of acute myeloid leukaemia whose incidence is independent of age. This observation indicates that acute myeloid leukaemia can develop via multiple pathways, and underlines the importance of cytogenetics in understanding this disease.\n",
      "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relation between the grade of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and several outcome parameters. Special attention was given to leukaemia-free survival (LFS). The study included 2,122 patients with acute leukaemia in first remission and 780 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in the first chronic phase, who were receiving first transplants from HLA-identical donors. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was the same in patients with or without grade I acute GVHD, but was increased in patients with grades II, III and IV acute GVHD. In patients with grades 0, I, II, III and IV acute GVHD, the five-year probability of TRM (+/-SE) overall was 20 +/- 1%, 19 +/- 2%, 30 +/- 2%, 61 +/- 4% and 90 +/- 3%, respectively. The incidence of relapse in patients with grades I-IV was lower than in patients without acute GVHD. The five-year relapse probability according to GVHD grade (0-IV), was 28 +/- 2%, 22 +/- 2%, 22 +/- 2%, 17 +/- 5% and 20 +/- 2%. The five-year LFS in all patients with leukaemia, according to grade of acute GVHD, was 57 +/- 2%, 63 +/- 2%, 55 +/- 3%, 32 +/- 4% and 8 +/- 3%. In multivariate analysis, adjustments for age, sex, diagnosis, interval from diagnosis to transplantation, T-cell depletion and year of transplantation were considered. Patients with grade I acute GVHD had the highest LFS (relative risk 0.84, p = 0.04 compared with those without acute GVHD).\n",
      "Acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) is a disease of the elderly with a median age at presentation in the seventh decade and a peak incidence in the U.K. of greater than 20 patients per 100,000 population per yr between the ages of 80 and 84. Most major AML trials are carried out on a younger population of patients with low recruitment of the elderly. The results in older patients are much worse than younger patients and often no better than the natural history of the disease. These poor results may be partly due to poor tolerance of treatment in the elderly, but are also due to intrinsic differences between AML in the elderly and AML in younger patients. These problems all justify randomised, prospective trials designed specifically for elderly patients to test prognostic scoring and various levels of intensity of therapy.\n",
      "The enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is the most specific marker of myeloid lineage. The recognition of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with minimally differentiation (AML-M0) is established with methods that include myeloid markers CD13/CD33 and detection of MPO in blast cells by immunological techniques or electron microscopy cytochemistry (EM). We have analysed the presence of MPO in leukaemic blast cells by conventional cytochemistry and immunological methods using a monoclonal antibody anti-MPO (CLB-MPO1) in 121 cases of acute leukaemia. The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity of this McAb to identify AML-M0, as CD13/CD33 can be expressed in some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and EM cytochemistry is not always available in many laboratories. Anti-MPO was positive in all cases of AML (M1-M5) which were positive by Sudan Black B reaction in similar or higher percentage ratio for each case, although in some of them did not label with CD13/CD33 tested by IF and IPc techniques. Based on the anti-MPO positivity, 5 out of 10 cases called undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) were reclassified as AML-M0, though 4 cases were CD13/CD33 negative. Furthermore, after analysing the anti-MPO expression among 32 cases of ALL, we had to reclassify four of them as acute biphenotypic leukaemia. We conclude that anti-MPO is a very sensitive and reliable tool in AML diagnosis and has an important role in distinguishing minimally differentiated AML and biphenotypic acute leukaemia from AUL and ALL.\n",
      "We have investigated graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effects after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), using three murine leukaemia models, A20 (B lymphocytic), WEHI-3 (myelomonocytic) and PU5-1R (myeloid). Injection of leukaemia cells in a high number (10(6) cells) into syngeneic Balb/c mice (H-2d) invariably led to death with a median survival time of 22 d (A20), 18 d (WEHI-3) and 45 d (PU5-1R). A lower tumour load of A20 (5 x 10(5) cells) was used in some experiments resulting in a leukaemic death rate of 94%. Lethal total-body irradiation followed by syngeneic BMT prolonged survival (P<0.05) for animals bearing the leukaemia A20 and WEHI-3 but was unsuccessful for animals injected with cells from the monocytic leukaemia PU5-1R. Graft-versus-host (GVH)-nonreactive marrow of (C57 x Balb/c)F1 mice (H2bxd) exerted a significant GVL-effect with reduced relapse rate and improved survival in mice receiving the leukaemia cell line A20. In animals with low tumour load a significant reduction of the relapse rate from 82% following syngeneic BMT to 47% following allogeneic, GVH-nonreactive BMT could be achieved. Depletion of natural killer (NK) cells from the GVL-reactive semi-allogenic bone marrow graft enhances the relapse rate of the leukaemia A20 to 65%. In mice bearing the leukaemias WEHI-3 or PU5-1R allogeneic GVH-nonreactive BMT did not improve survival compared to syngeneic BMT. Transplantation of GVH-reactive bone marrow from DBA mice (MHC identical to Balb/c, minor difference) caused only a limited and insignificant reduction of relapse rate for animals with the leukaemia A20. These in vivo data are in close correlation with in vitro natural killer cell (NK) activity of the donor strains against the respective leukaemia targets. Depletion of NK cells from the GVL-reactive (C57 x Balb/c)F1 bone marrow resulted in a significant loss of GVL activity. We conclude that NK cells are involved in graft-versus-leukaemia effects independent of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n",
      "Fifty formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded cases of T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) from 12 bone marrow trephines and 38 lymph nodes were stained with a new monoclonal antibody, 2TL 242, raised against recombinant TAL1 protein. The antibody recognizes TAL-1 polypeptides of molecular weight 39 and 41 kD (full length). In addition, a variety of other leukaemias and lymphomas were also stained with 2TL 242. Twenty-four of the 50 cases of T-ALL showed nuclear positivity, ranging from 10 to 90 per cent of leukaemic cells. A positive staining reaction was nuclear and stippled in pattern. Nuclear staining was not seen in any other type of leukaemia or lymphoma. Five cases of follicular lymphoma showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining of variable intensity. Although some background staining is obtained with this antibody, positive nuclear staining is easily distinguishable. This monoclonal antibody has a potential role in primary diagnosis and in the detection of minimal residual disease in T-ALL.\n",
      "In the early 1960s, Professor William (Bill) F.H. Jarrett was presented with a time-space cluster of cats with lymphoma identified by a local veterinary practitioner, Harry Pfaff, and carried out experiments to find if the condition might be caused by a virus, similar to lymphomas noted previously in poultry and mice. In 1964, the transmission of lymphoma in cats and the presence of virus-like particles that resembled 'the virus of murine leukaemias' in the induced tumours were reported in Nature. These seminal studies initiated research on feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and launched the field of feline retrovirology. This review article considers the way in which some of the key early observations made by Bill Jarrett and his coworkers have developed in subsequent years and discusses progress that has been made in the field since FeLV was first discovered.\n",
      "Serial cytogenetic analysis revealed karyotypically unrelated clones in four patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) in remission. At diagnosis, three patients had t(8;21)(q22;q22) and one had an inv(16)(p13q22). After 18-22 months in remission, different clones emerged in each patient with myelodysplastic features of the bone marrow cells. The emergence of clones with abnormalities of chromosome 7 in remission seems to be an unfavourable factor for prognosis.\n",
      "The very rapid development in the last few years of techniques based on use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for characterizing molecular lesions in leukaemia and lymphoma now offers the opportunity for monitoring residual disease at a sensitivity of one malignant cell in 10(5) or 10(6) normal cells. Maximal specificity is presumably achieved when the DNA sequences amplified are truly leukaemia-specific, such as BCR/ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia, RARA PML/RARA in t(15;17) acute myelogenous leukemia, DEK/CAN in t(6;9) AML, PBX1/E2A in t(1;19) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or TAL-1 deletions in other T-ALLs. Comparable sensitivity may be achieved by using immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements if a clonospecific probe can be generated. However, the presence of similar sequences in IgH genes from normal B lymphocytes may decrease the specificity. For clinical purposes the crucial issues are the following. Can PCR techniques be used for confirmation of diagnosis and evaluation of extent of disease? Can PCR data obtained in remission provide information about the probability of cure or of relapse? Can techniques be developed to quantitate the PCR product and thereby increase its predictive value? These and other issues were addressed at the 4th Workshop of the Molecular Biology/BMT Study Group that took place in Bristol UK on 9-10 May 1992.\n",
      "The relative concentrations of pCG14 RNA (a myelocyte-specific mRNA), pAM6 RNA (a monocyte-lineage specific marker), and c-myc RNA (present at higher concentrations in more primitive cells) were measured in the RNAs from peripheral blood leucocytes from leukaemic samples and normal individuals. The potential of differences in the relative abundances of these three RNAs in a series of 34 leukaemias was assessed as a means of distinguishing among the myeloid leukaemias. The chronic phase CGL samples were clustered with a high pCG14 RNA, a medium to low c-myc RNA abundance, and a variable pAM6 RNA level. The ANLL samples could be distinguished from the chronic phase CGL by virtue of different relative abundances of these RNAs: low pCG14, medium to high c-myc and a variable pAM6. The acute phase CGL samples showed a variety of relative RNA abundances with some samples sited within the ANLL region. Using samples obtained during the progression of CGL we have shown a shift in the relative abundances of these RNAs from the CGL region towards the ANLL region, and have suggested that the use of these parameters may allow the progression to acute phase to be monitored and, possibly, predicted.\n",
      "There is a general belief that the clustering of childhood leukaemia is a widespread phenomenon and that it provides evidence for appreciable environmental influence on the incidence of the disease. We discuss this issue critically, identifying different kinds of clustering and their possible aetiological mechanisms and examining some analyses of British data. We argue that, in some cases, analyses have been used which lead to dubious conclusions, and that, allowing for multiple testing and anecdotal reporting, the total evidence for clustering is at best weak.\n",
      "Vertebrate haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to a hierarchically organised set of progenitors for erythroid, myeloid, lymphoid and megakaryocyte lineages, and are responsible for lifelong maintenance of the blood system. Dysregulation of the haematopoietic differentiation programme is at the origin of numerous pathologies, including leukaemias. With the discoveries that many transcriptional regulators and signalling pathways controlling blood cell development are conserved between humans and Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly has become a good model for investigating the mechanisms underlying the generation of blood cell lineages and blood cell homeostasis. In this review article, we discuss how genetic and molecular studies of Drosophila haematopoiesis can contribute to our understanding of the haematopoietic niche, as well as of the origin and/or progression of haematopoietic malignancies in humans.\n",
      "The clinical and laboratory data of 48 leukapheresis-treated patients with hyperleucocytic leukaemia (HL) was reviewed to assess the correlation between the degree of leucoreduction and early mortality. Leukapheresis resulted in > 50% leucoreductions and postapheresis WBC counts < 100 x 10(9)/l in most patients (64.5%). Patients presenting with neurological, respiratory or renal complications had higher early mortality rates than patients without such complications, despite similar initial WBC counts and comparable leucoreductions. Thus, in these patients, more efficient leucoreduction was not associated with improved early survival.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Deregulation of the MAPK genes signalling caused by somatic mutations have been implied in leukaemia pathogenesis, including RAS mutation (RASmut) in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which has been associated with intra-uterine chemical exposures. A case-case study was conducted in order to explore maternal and child exposures to tobacco smoking associations with early age leukaemia (EAL). METHODS: Covariables of reference were MLL rearrangements (MLL-r), RASmut and NQO1 rs1800566 (C609T). Samples from 150 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 85 AML were included. Maternal exposures were assessed using a structured questionnaire with demographic, personal habits and residence history information. Restriction fragment length polymorphism and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography were used to screen FLT3, KRAS, and NRAS mutations; direct sequencing was performed to validate the results. NQO1 polymorphism was detected by real-time allelic discrimination technique. RESULTS: Overall, RASmut were detected in 28.7% of EAL cases; BRAFmut was found only in one AML patient. Higher rate of KRASmut was found in ALL (30.3%) compared to AML (20.8%) with MLL-r; RASmut showed an association with second-hand tobacco smoking exposures (OR, 3.06, 95% CI, 1.03-9.07). A considerable increased risk for EAL with the combination of RASmut and NQO1 609CT (OR, 4.24, 95% CI, 1.24-14.50) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated the increased risk association between maternal smoking and EAL with MLL-r. Additionally, suggests that children second-hand tobacco exposures are associated with increased risk of EAL with RASmut modulated by NQO1 rs1800566 (C609T).\n",
      "A multi-centre retrospective analysis on 117 patients relapsing after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for acute leukaemia was carried out by the Leukaemia Working Party of the European Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation (E.B.M.T.). Forty-one patients had acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 76 had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Relapse occurred between 3 and 30 months after BMT and where investigated the leukaemia was found to have relapsed in recipient cells. In 10 cases the relapse was associated with new cytogenetic abnormalities. 74 patients received further treatment for leukaemia. Of these 21 out of 50 with ALL and 11 out of 24 with AML achieved a complete remission and had a median survival of 12 months compared with a median survival of 4 months for untreated patients or patients not achieving complete remission (P less than 0.001). Factors predictive for successful remission induction were a long interval between bone marrow transplant and relapse in ALL patients; and isolated extramedullary relapse. Presenting blast count, karyotype and remission status and number at the time of BMT were not predictive. Donor bone marrow was shown to be responsible for haemopoietic recovery occurring in the 21 out of 31 patients tested who achieved remission using donor karyotype or red blood cell antigens as markers. Nine patients received a second bone marrow transplant but only one became a long-term survivor. The results show that chemotherapy can usually prolong survival in selected patients with acute leukaemia relapsing after BMT but further BMT has a poor outlook.\n",
      "Hairy-cell leukaemia (HCL) is usually readily diagnosed by seeing typical hairy cells (HCs) in the blood film. The diagnosis is then confirmed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, marker analysis, and bone marrow examination. HCs are clonal mature memory B cells with specific features of activation. This HC activation is responsible for many of the pathological features of the disease, including its distinctive bone marrow fibrosis, splenic red pulp invasion, and pseudo-sinus formation. Chlorodeoxyadenasine is the treatment of first choice. Deoxycoformycin and rituximab are useful for the treatment of relapsed/refractory disease. The nature of the primary oncogenic event(s) remains unknown and is the major unresolved issue in HCL.\n",
      "Experimental work in animal models suggests that the course of systemic and organ-specific autoimmune disorders can be modified by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We describe two patients, each with a long history of psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, who received an allogeneic BMT for leukaemia. Four years post-BMT, they remain in full remission of psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, and of their leukaemia. We review the evidence for support of the concept that both psoriasis and ulcerative colitis are immune-mediated disorders and speculate on the possible role of allogeneic BMT in treating life-threatening autoimmune disorders.\n",
      "Leptin alone and in combination with other cytokines has a stimulatory effect on proliferation of leukaemic cells. This effect may be due to prevention of apoptosis of progenitor cells or upregulation of specific receptors on leukaemic precursors that make them more responsive to stimuli. This work investigates the relationship between serum leptin level, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in acute leukaemic patients. The relationship to blood cell counts, haemoglobin and response to chemotherapy was also investigated. The study included 25 acute leukaemic male patients [15 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 10 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)] and 15 age and sex matched healthy controls. All were subjected to thorough history taking, clinical examination, complete blood picture, hepatic and renal function tests and determination of serum leptin, IL-6 and VEGF levels. In addition, patients were subjected to bone marrow aspiration, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping study and serum leptin assay after chemotherapy. Serum leptin level showed statistically significant elevation only in AML group (p<0.01). This elevation was unrelated to the presence of extramedullary infiltration or response to chemotherapy and correlated only with body mass index (p<0.05). In ALL, the mean serum leptin level was insignificantly different from the controls. In both AML and ALL, there was no significant difference in serum leptin level before and after treatment. Statistically significant elevation of IL-6 and VEGF, uncorrelated with serum leptin level was detected in AML patients when compared with the controls. No correlation was found between serum leptin level and any of the studied haematological parameters. It is concluded that the release of leptin, IL-6 and VEGF may be regulated by different mechanisms leading to diversity in clinical features of the disease.\n",
      "AIMS: To detect cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens using flow cytometry in acute leukaemia and to use this technique for double marker combinations. METHODS: Cytoplasmic staining was carried out in samples from 40 cases of acute leukaemia with monoclonal antibodies against the myeloid antigen CD13, the lymphoid antigens CD3, CD22, mu chain and the enzymes terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilised with Tween 20 and Becton Dickinson FACS lysing solution. Flow cytometry results were compared in the same cases with immunocytochemistry results using the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase method. RESULTS: The gentle permeabilisation induced by this method permitted preservation of the membrane antigens and the size and morphology of the cells. The results using flow cytometry were comparable with those obtained using immunocytochemistry, with nearly complete concordance in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: This technique is simple, rapid, sensitive and reproducible and it is suitable for double staining procedures, such as nuclear and cytoplasmic, nuclear and membrane, or cytoplasmic and membrane. It therefore provides a powerful tool for extending the use of immunophenotyping for the diagnosis and follow up of acute leukaemia. It could also be used for the investigation of minimal residual disease.\n",
      "To determine the epidemiology and outcome of children with Down syndrome (DS) diagnosed with acute leukaemia in the Nordic countries, data registered in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) population-based leukaemia registry were analysed. Of 3494 children with acute leukaemia diagnosed between July 1984 and December 2001, 136 patients (3.9%) with DS were identified. 2.1% of the children with acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) and 14.0% of the children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) had DS. In ALL, DS patients had similar age and sex distribution and no major differences in blood counts compared with non-DS children. None of the DS patients had T cell leukaemia. Outcome was inferior to that of non-DS children and treatment results did not improve over time. In AML, DS patients showed a significant female predominance and all but one were <5 years old. DS patients with AML had significantly lower platelet and white blood cell counts and two-thirds were type M7 as according to the French-American-British classification. None of the patients <5 years of age had typical AML cytogenetic aberrations. Outcome was far better in the DS group. DS patients treated for AML after 1992 had an excellent outcome (probability of event-free survival, 83 +/- 6%). The high proportion of female DS patients with AML is unexplained. The differing treatment results in AML versus ALL need further evaluation and represent a challenge for the coming years.\n",
      "Three cases of acute leukaemia with t(4;12) (q11-12;p13) karyotypic abnormalities were analysed. They had the following common clinical and biological characteristics: (1) dysplasia of three haemopoietic lineages: (2) absent or low myeloperoxidase activity: and (3) retention of platelets in the peripheral blood and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. There were increased numbers of basophils in the bone marrow and peripheral blood in two of the cases. In all, the blast cells displayed the unique immunophenotype CD7+CD13+CD34+HLA-DR+. The blasts analysed in one case expressed c-kit on the membrane surface. These findings suggest that the t(4;12) (q11-12;p13) abnormality is associated with a particular type of acute leukaemia, one in which the morphology and immunophenotype suggest that the translocation may have occurred at an early stage of haemopoiesis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: A clinical pilot study performed by our group showed that dacarbazine can induce a marked reduction of blast cells in patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Leukaemic blasts (LB) from responsive patients showed low levels of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (OGAT). DESIGN: An in vitro study was performed to evaluate OGAT levels and sensitivity to temozolomide (a triazene compound that spontaneously decomposes into the active metabolite of dacarbazine) in a relatively large number of LB samples. RESULTS: OGAT levels varied widely among the LB of different patients, with a mean value higher in acute lymphoblastic leukaemias than in AML. About 25% of LB obtained from patients with AML showed low OGAT activity, in the range corresponding to that observed in leukaemic patients responsive to dacarbazine in vivo. A reasonable inverse correlation was found between OGAT levels and LB sensitivity to temozolomide. CONCLUSIONS: Triazenes could have a therapeutic potential in human leukaemias. Moreover, OGAT determination could provide rapid and reliable information about a patient susceptibility to these antitumor agents.\n",
      "The recent publication reviewing the updated WHO classification commented on the presence of cyclin D1-positive cells in the proliferation centres (PC) of small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (SLL/CLL). The figure quoted was 30%, which appeared higher than our experience. To assess cyclin D1 expression in PC of SLL/CLL cases, we performed a review of SLL/CLL cases diagnosed at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 1996 and 2009. Of 105 SLL/CLL cases, 16.2% showed expression of cyclin D1 in PC with none carrying the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32). Our study and a review of the published literature suggest that this phenomenon occurs with a significantly lower prevalence than that described in the recent review of the updated WHO classification. We confirm that cyclin D1 expression is confined to PC with the typical small lymphocytes being negative. This finding is apparently unrelated to the translocation involving CCND1 and IGH genes.\n",
      "A monoclonal antibody, NP57, was produced and used against the neutrophil granule protein elastase, which selectively stain neutrophils in cryostat and paraffin wax sections. The antibody stains neutrophils and a subpopulation of monocytes in blood smears and neutrophil precursors in bone marrow smears, and gives positive reactions with the cell lines HL60 and U-937. It labelled the blast cells in 68% of cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (M1-M5) but was unreactive with all cases of lymphoid leukaemias. Most of the elastase negative myeloid leukaemias were labelled by monoclonal anti-myeloperoxidase (antibody MPO-7) as were cells from the promyelocytic line HL60. No cases of myeloid leukaemia showed the opposite pattern--that is elastase positive, myeloperoxidase negative, suggesting that the production of myeloperoxidase precedes the onset of elastase synthesis during myeloid maturation. The anti-elastase antibody NP57 is a useful addition to the range of monoclonal antibodies available for the differential diagnosis of acute leukaemia by alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) labelling of cell smears; it may also be of value for the histopathological diagnosis of tumour deposits in myeloid leukaemia and for the detection of neutrophils in paraffin sections.\n",
      "The term \"leukaemia\" refers to a large and heterogenous group of diseases, with treatment response and outcome dependent on the specific type of malignancy. New molecular methods allow us to specifically evaluate the type of disorder, and provide treatment of necessary intensity. The aim of this review is to provide insight into the progress in leukaemia treatment that had been possible due to advances in molecular genetics over the last few decades. Those new sophisticated diagnostic methods have allowed us not only to predict patients' prognosis but also to provide a specific therapy depending on the molecular and genetic characteristics of patients. Our review is based on 25 articles regarding novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods as well as prognostic factors, released between 1992 and 2011. Those articles focus mostly on molecular and cytogenetic testing allowing revolutionary methods of patient classification and individual therapy for this highly heterogeneous group of disorders. Implementation of molecular genetic testing to evaluate the type of leukaemia allowed paediatric oncologists and haematologists to adjust the intensity of treatment, improve outcome, minimize toxicity of therapies and considerably lower the risk of side effects. In the last few decades there has been a great improvement in survival among children suffering from haematopoietic malignancies. Progress made in molecular genetics allowed the creation of new treatment protocols that are designed to maintain a high cure rate for children with leukaemia while reducing toxicity.\n",
      "We have previously demonstrated that when freshly isolated childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells are incubated in growth medium after isolation from blood, chromatin is rapidly cleaved into nucleosomal sized fragments that are multiples of 200 bp. The fragmentation is similar to that observed in other types of cells undergoing apoptosis or programmed cell death. In this study we describe a more comprehensive approach to the study of DNA fragmentation in leukaemia. Fragmentation was observed in freshly isolated cells from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and in one with common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Frozen samples of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and acute myeloid leukaemia cells also showed fragmentation of DNA. However, no fragmentation was evident in normal leukocytes treated under the same conditions. Ultrastructural studies on the isolated leukaemia cells demonstrate that the chromatin cleavage observed biochemically is associated with morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis.\n",
      "There is a need for novel treatment for acute leukaemia as relapse rates remain unacceptably high. Immunotherapy aims to stimulate the patient immune responses to recognize and destroy leukaemia cells whilst activating immune memory. The qualities of the most potent professional antigen-presenting cell, the dendritic cell (DC), can be used to stimulate leukaemia-specific cytotoxic T cells. DCs can be loaded with leukaemia antigens, or leukaemia blasts can be modified to express DC-like properties for use in vaccine therapy. This chapter will review the rationale for DC vaccine therapy, the preclinical and clinical trials to date, the barriers to successful DC vaccine therapies and the role of immune adjuncts to improve outcomes.\n",
      "Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) provides one of the few ways of analysing the genotype of individual cells, an important consideration for mixed cell populations such as those found in leukaemia. A more sophisticated variation combines fluorescence immunophenotyping and FISH for specific leukaemia-associated chromosome rearrangements. Combined immunophenotyping and FISH is a powerful tool to identify the cell lineage in which the leukaemia-specific chromosome rearrangement occurs and has been used to identify putative pre-leukaemic cells in normal cord blood. Another valuable FISH-based research technique is multi-fluor FISH (M-FISH). This multicolour approach is effectively a molecular karyotype of individual cells and has a range of applications, from chromosome breakage studies and characterising mouse models of leukaemia, to providing a perfect complementary approach to the emerging genomic microarray technologies.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: There is an ongoing debate on the possible association between infections in early childhood and subsequent cancer risk, but it remains unclear if a hospital admission for infection is associated with risk of childhood cancer diagnosis. We examined if a hospital-based diagnosis of pneumonia was a clinical marker of the three most common childhood cancers. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Denmark, hospital diagnoses, 1994-2013. METHODS: Using national health registries, we compared the observed incidence of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer among 83 935 children with a hospital-based pneumonia diagnosis with that expected among children in the general population. We calculated absolute cancer risks and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) as a measure of relative risk. RESULTS: The cancer SIRs were substantially increased during the first 6 months of follow-up; lymphoid leukaemia: 6.2 (95% CI 3.5 to 10.3); myeloid leukaemia: 14.8 (95% CI 6.0 to 30.6); Hodgkin lymphoma: 60.8 (95% CI 26.2 to 120), non-Hodgkin lymphoma: 15.9 (95% CI 5.2 to 37.2) and brain cancer: 4.4 (95% CI 1.9 to 8.7). The 6-month absolute risks of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer were all low, reaching 0.05% when combined. An increased risk persisted beyond 5 years for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and brain cancer. However, the 5-year absolute cancer risk was 0.14%. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term incidence of leukaemia, lymphoma and brain cancer was higher than expected and persisted beyond 5 years for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and brain cancer. However, the absolute cancer risk was low.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The limit of acceptable toxicity for standard chemotherapeutic drugs used in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) therapy has been reached. New therapeutic strategies are therefore needed. OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes development in new strategies, and gives an overview of the clinical status on new drugs for non-promyelocytic AML in adults. METHODS: Information was principally gathered from the databases ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed.gov. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The major improvements in AML treatment during the last two decades has not been the introduction of new therapeutic agents, but rather the more optimal use of well-known drugs (e.g., high-dose cytarabine therapy, the use of ATRA in maintenance therapy of acute promyelocytic leukaemia) and improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of potentially life-threatening complications in patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, further investigations based on specific targeted therapy and stratification of patients according to knowledge of the individual disease and health status will probably be necessary in future studies of new targeted therapy.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous disease, with biologically and prognostically different subtypes distinguished by cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis, as recognised in the latest (2008) WHO classification system. However, since the publication of this schema, application of various high throughout technologies including whole genome and exome sequencing of AML cases has revealed a plethora of recurrent mutational targets, including a number of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, not previously implicated in leukaemogenesis. Deciphering the combinations of mutations that cooperate to induce AML and determining which particular alterations (or combinations) confer independent prognostic information represent major ongoing challenges, which will necessitate analysis of large cohort sizes involving international cooperation. However, the uncertainty concerning optimal risk-stratification of AML based on the rapidly evolving picture emerging from molecular genetic profiling provides a strong rationale for evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) detection as a tool to refine outcome prediction. This modality may not only capture differences in treatment response that reflect the underlying molecular heterogeneity, but also inter-patient variability in drug availability and metabolism, which may also significantly influence outcome. Developments in leukaemia diagnostics coupled with the possibility that MRD may be tracked using molecular and/or flow cytometry-based methods in the majority of patients hold considerable promise to inform more personalized approaches to therapy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In recent decades, following the introduction of effective chemotherapy, the prognosis of children with leukaemia and lymphoma has dramatically improved, but data reflecting further possible improvement achieved in the 1990s are scarce. METHODS: Using the Automated Childhood Cancer Information (ACCIS) database, we carried out a period analysis of 10-year survival for the 1995-99 period. Analyses were carried out by diagnostic groups, age-group at diagnosis, sex and four European regions. RESULTS: Ten-year survival estimates for the 1995-99 period were 73% for any type of leukaemia, 78% for acute lymphoid leukaemia and 52% for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. The corresponding 10-year survival rates for all types of lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were 84, 91 and 79%, respectively. These figures are much higher than those obtained by traditional (cohort-based) methods of survival analysis. A large difference in prognosis is still observed between the East and other parts of Europe. CONCLUSION: Major improvement in prognosis for children with leukaemia or lymphoma has been ongoing in Europe during the 1990s, but further monitoring and investments are required to remove the large regional differences between European regions.\n",
      "We reviewed the reports of 79 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia patients admitted to our department between 1996 and 2005. Patients' characteristics and outcome were analysed. The acute myeloid leukaemia rate for all patients who received intensive chemotherapy, i.e. age > or = 60 years was 52.9%; in the age group (60-69) and > or = 70 years it was 62.5% and 44.4%, respectively. The acute myeloid leukaemia rate difference between the diagnosis periods (1996-2000) and (2001-2005) are statistically significant only in the age group (60-69) years (P = 0.018). For patients who received intensive chemotherapy and treatment other than intensive chemotherapy, the median overall survival was 9.73 and 3.6 months, respectively (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in overall survival between the age groups for the two diagnosis periods, except in patients aged > or = 80 years 3.0 and 0.63 month, respectively (P = 0.023). This study improved knowledge of characteristics and outcome of elderly acute myeloid leukaemia patients in our department.\n",
      "The incidence rate (IR) of bloodstream infections (BI) and invasive mycoses (IM) during chemotherapy for paediatric acute lymphoblastic (ALL) or non-lymphoblastic leukaemias (AnLL) was evaluated for 153 BI and 22 IM diagnosed during 143,668 patient-days at risk from January 1988 to December 2000. IR, the number of episodes/100 days at risk, was 0.315 for AnLL and 0.092 for ALL (P < 0.001) with significant changes reflecting the intensity of anti-ALL chemotherapy. IR was 0.097 for first-line less intensive, 0.136 during first-line intensive, 0.261 during second-line therapy (P < 0.001), and 0.021 during maintenance. During intensive chemotherapy, the IR for BI was 0.134 in ALL with 0.087 for first-line less intensive therapy, 0.110 for first-line intensive, 0.230 for second-line intensive therapy (P < 0.001) and 0.274 in AnLL (P = 0.001). IR was 0.021 in ALL and 0.048 in AnLL (P = 0.034) for IM. In conclusion, there is a correlation between intensity of chemotherapy and rate of infections in paediatric acute leukaemias.\n",
      "Recent progress has demonstrated that acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) can be classified by chromosomal aberrations and leukaemia-specific molecular gene rearrangements into homogeneous biological subgroups. However, descriptive epidemiological reports on AML consider the disease as a single entity. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is an example of a truly unique AML subtype that has an easy-to-recognize morphology associated uniformly with distinct chromosomal and gene rearrangement aberration. Thus, APL is amenable to epidemiological studies as a model of human AML with a specific and well-characterized chromosomal and molecular abnormality. This chapter shows that epidemiological characteristics of APL are different from those of non-APL AML using data from the Los Angeles tumour registry and other sources. The principal distinct APL epidemiological features that so far have been described are the constant incidence with age after age 20, equal incidence in males and females and higher frequency among patients originating in Latin America. The APL-specific PML/RARalpha gene rearrangement is different in Latinos and non-Latinos. Therapy-related APL has the same response to treatment and outcome as de novo APL. It is therefore likely that aetiological factors for APL are different from those of other AML subtypes. So far no environmental and/or occupational risk factors have been found for APL. Future molecular studies of the APL-specific fusion gene combined with epidemiological and environmental investigations might lead to better understanding of specific aetiological factors in APL patients.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prehospital presentation of paediatric leukaemia and identify the disease and non-disease related factors which facilitate or impede diagnosis. DESIGN: Thematic analysis of qualitative semistructured interviews. SETTING: One tertiary referral centre in Southern England. PARTICIPANTS: 21 parents and 9 general practitioners (GPs) of 18 children (<18-year-old) with a new diagnosis of acute leukaemia. RESULTS: The majority of children were first seen by GPs before the characteristic signs and symptoms of leukaemia had developed. In their absence, behavioural cues such as the child becoming apathetic or 'not themselves' often triggered parents to seek medical help. Most GPs were unclear about the nature and severity of the child presentation: then, safety netting, thorough history-taking and examination, and reliance on contextual information about the parents or from prior hospital paediatrics experience were used to manage diagnostic uncertainty. The nature of the doctor-parent relationship helped and hindered the diagnostic pathway. GPs' prior perceptions of parents as being ensible' or 'worriers' influenced how gravely they treated parental concerns, with 'worriers' being taken less seriously. Some parents believed GPs failed to listen to their anxieties and discounted their expert knowledge of their child. Specific delay factors included lack of continuity of GP; some GPs' reluctance to take blood from children; and some parents feeling unable to voice effectively their concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of paediatric leukaemia in primary care differs from that described in many hospital studies, with greater diversity and intermittency of symptoms, and the frequent absence of 'red flags' of serious illness. A wide range of non-disease related factors potentially delay the diagnosis of paediatric leukaemia, including tensions in the doctor-patient relationship and the doctors' cognitive biases. The identification and attempted modification of these factors may minimise diagnostic delay more successfully than raising awareness of 'red flags' of disease.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the utility of flow cytometry for phenotyping of acute leukaemias and selection-of monoclonal antibodies. DATA SOURCES: The literature review was obtained through internet, journals and chapters in the relevant books. DATA SELECTION: Relevant articles and chapters on immunophenotyping of acute leukaemias were selected from respected international journals and books in the field of haematology and were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Complete articles relevant to the topic were selected and reviewed and the necessary information extracted for this review. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry has been used extensively in recent years to characterise haemopoeitic malignancies and done routinely in the developed world. This technique has greatly improved the diagnosis and classification of haemopoeitic malignancies and has been recommended by World Health Organisation classification (WHO) of tumours of haemopoeitic and lymphoid tissue. Application of flow cytometry for the diagnosis of leukaemias has been recently introduced in Kenya and is currently being undertaken in research using limited but appropriate panels of monoclonal antibodies. It is hoped that findings of this research will inform the use of flow cytometry as an ancillary diagnostic technique in our resource-constrained set up.\n",
      "Neonatal leukaemia cutis is a significant neoplasm that may represent a cutaneous manifestation of systemic leukaemia, usually of myeloblastic type. Rarely, it may be or appear to be limited to skin, in which case it is called neonatal aleukaemic leukaemia cutis. By definition, it presents within the first 4 weeks of life and often has a 'blueberry muffin baby' appearance of magenta coloured nodules affecting almost any area of the skin, usually sparing mucous membranes, palms and soles. This clinical pattern is more commonly associated with neonatal infections such rubella and toxoplasmosis, and may be evident with other neonatal neoplasms such as neuroblastoma. Due to the morbidity associated with chemotherapy and reported cases of spontaneous remission without systemic progression in those with neonatal aleukaemic leukaemia cutis without 11q23 translocation, the authors not treating the child with chemotherapy, but to simply monitor for fading of the violaceous nodules, and watch for possible signs of systemic leukaemia.\n",
      "The detection of small numbers of leukaemia cells in patients with occult disease has important clinical implications. Leukaemia is a monoclonal disease which frequently displays clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma (TCR gamma) and/or immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene. Clone-specific junctional sequences arising as a result of these gene rearrangements provide potentially valuable targets for monitoring residual disease by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, existing strategies for PCR amplification of these clone-specific rearrangements frequently lack the necessary sensitivity or specificity, due either to the small size of the target junctional region, or to interference resulting from polyclonal IgH or TCR gamma rearrangements in normal lymphocytes. We have previously described a novel PCR strategy to overcome these obstacles which is based on the design of two overlapping clone-specific PCR primers which span the junctional region. We now describe a modification to this strategy which employs relatively short clone-specific primers which further increases the level of specificity. This new method should improve the detection of residual cells, particularly in those cases displaying small junctional regions. Unlike other strategies, specificity is generated from the initial round of amplification. This non-radioactive technique should thus prove effective in monitoring residual leukaemia in patients.\n",
      "Fifty-four patients allografted for leukaemia were evaluated at various intervals after bone marrow transplantation for the presence of host haemopoiesis using red blood cell and cytogenetic markers. Out of 40 patients in remission, 10 showed functional host and donor haemopoiesis (mixed chimerism), whereas in the other 30 (complete chimerism) host haemopoiesis was never detected. Seven of the 14 evaluable patients who relapsed showed the reappearance of host haemopoiesis at the time of relapse. Analysis of the dose of total body irradiation (TBI) indicated that patients who achieved mixed chimerism, whether or not they relapsed, had received significantly lower doses than those with complete chimerism. However, some patients with complete chimerism had received a TBI dose equivalent to the dose received by those with mixed chimerism, suggesting that the TBI dose is not the only factor determining the reappearance of host haemopoiesis. The data on chimerism and relapse suggest that there is heterogeneity in radiosensitivity between normal marrow cells and leukaemic cells, and also within the different types of leukaemia. The incidence/severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) was significantly higher in patients with complete chimerism than in mixed chimeras, suggesting that mixed chimerism may play a role in the development of tolerance. Alternatively the absence of GVHD (i.e. tolerance) may be responsible for the persistence of host haemopoietic cells.\n",
      "The aetiology of childhood leukaemia remains generally unknown, although exposure to moderate and high levels of ionizing radiation, such as those experienced during the atomic bombings of Japan or from radiotherapy, is an established cause. Risk models based primarily on studies of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors imply that low-level exposure to ionizing radiation, including ubiquitous natural background radiation, also raises the risk of childhood leukaemia. Using two sets of recently published leukaemia risk models and estimates of natural background radiation red-bone-marrow doses received by children, about 20% of the cases of childhood leukaemia in Great Britain are predicted to be attributable to this source. However, for one of these sets of risk models this attributable fraction is materially dependent on how the radiation-induced risk is assumed to be transferred between the Japanese atomic bomb survivors and Western children. Over a range of annual doses representing the range (0.5-2.5 mSv/year) experienced by most populations, the attributable proportion for the preferred risk-transfer model varies between 8 and 30%, with small deviations from a linear relationship that are largely due to the saturation of the model, although again this range of attributable fractions depends on the assumed transfer of risk between populations.\n",
      "Bone-marrow being a home to various kinds of normal hematopoietic cells, sometime becomes overcrowded by abnormal cell population in malignancies like in acute myeloid leukaemia. One such dilemma in diagnosis betides when two abnormal cell populations in bone-marrow occur at the same time. A prime example is when reactive plasmacytosis in bone-marrow eventuate in relation with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Due to scarce amount of such cases reported, it is imperative to understand the difference between reactive plasmacytosis which arises after induction of chemotherapy and the one which is diagnosed along with AML, during initial diagnosis due to other causes, like infections and IL-6 production by the leukemic blast population. To substantiate these erstwhile arguments, the brief case history of a 45 years old female patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia with coincident reactive plasmacytosis having no previous history of chemotherapy is presented along with review of past published literature.\n",
      "The work studied possible association between genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6, GSTM1, GSTT1and NQO1 and altered susceptibility to leukaemia, correlating these genetic polymorphisms with clinical prognostic data, response to therapy and relapse. The study included 32 leukaemia patients, 19 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 13 with acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), and 11 normal individuals (control group). Basic investigations for the diagnosis of AML and ALL were performed, including blood picture, bone marrow aspirate, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping for detection of subtypes. Detection of CYP2D6, NQO1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genetic polymorphisms used a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. A follow-up was made for association between the outcome of patients and different patterns of genetic polymorphisms. Results demonstrate a significant increase in the frequency of CYP2D6 wild-type and GSTM1 null genotypes in the acute leukaemia group compared with the control. Studying the relationship between polymorphisms of these genes and the outcome of our cases revealed the wild genotype of CYP2D6 significantly influenced the outcome of acute leukaemia particularly in AML cases, while GSTM1 null genotype was associated with bad prognosis among the ALL group. The study also revealed that patients with combined mutant CYP2D6/present GSTM1/present GSTT1 achieved the best prognosis, suggesting synergistic impact of these genetic polymorphisms on the outcome of acute leukaemia cases. This case-control study suggests a contribution of CYP2D6 and GSTM1 null variants in the development of acute leukaemia. In addition, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes were apparently related to response, side effects and prognosis of patients with AML.\n",
      "We evaluated the outcome of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for advanced acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in 383 adult patients in nine Australian adult BMT centres between 1981 and 1997. The median overall survival for the group was 4.8 months, with an estimated 5-year survival of 18%. 28% of patients died of transplant-related toxicities within the first 100 d. Progressive disease was responsible for 48% of deaths. Multi-factor analysis demonstrated that AML (v ALL), disease status (second complete remission [CR2] v others), age (< 40 years) and duration of prior first complete remission (CR1) (> 6 months) were pre-transplant variables significantly associated with improved survival. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of any grade reduced the rate of relapse in both AML and ALL, but only grades I-II were associated with improved survival. Both limited and extensive chronic GVHD were associated with increased survival. Only patients with AML in untreated first relapse or CR2, with a duration of CR1 > 6 months, or patients with T ALL, had a 5-year survival > 20%. Transplants for AML in induction failure or pre-B ALL in untreated first relapse or CR2 had an intermediate outcome, with 5-year survival of 10-20%. A 5-year survival of < 10% was observed for patients transplanted for ALL in induction failure or for pre-B ALL or AML in refractory first relapse or beyond CR2. These results suggest that for most adult patients with advanced acute leukaemia an allograft offers only a small chance of cure.\n",
      "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been known as a versatile functional molecule, and as being involved in the colony formation of haemopoietic progenitor cells. Clinically, an elevated HGF level in the blood has been associated with liver diseases such as fulminant hepatic failure and acute hepatitis. We have found a high level of HGF in blood and bone marrow plasma from patients with various types of leukaemia and lymphoma. In particular, 21/31 acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) patients showed a significant level of HGF (> 0.40 ng/ml) in their blood or bone marrow plasma. The mean value of HGF in the plasma of AML patients was 2.03 ng/ml, which was higher than that in the serum of patients with acute hepatitis. This demonstrates, for the first time, evidence of frequent association of increased levels of HGF in non-lymphocytic leukaemias, though its significance in the disease remains unknown.\n",
      "Leukaemia is an uncommon late complication of exposure to the ionizing radiation of radioactive iodine (131I). Most cases reported have been of acute leukaemias developing after high doses of 131I. Only a few cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) have been reported in this setting to date. We report two new cases of CML after low dose radioactive iodine and review the literature. We present an analysis of the minimal relative risk of CML developing in thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I in Israel. Two male patients, 35 and 51 years old, developed CML following low dose 131I therapy for metastatic mixed papillary and follicular carcinoma of the thyroid. Both had undergone thyroidectomy and neck dissection and thyroid ablation with 131I (total dose: 56 and 130 mCi respectively). Four and 10 years later, respectively, a leucocytosis was noticed with typical blood smears, and CML was diagnosed either by Philadelphia translocation or bcr-abl gene rearrangement. Thyroid cancer at that time was in remission. Estimated minimal relative risk of CML after 131I therapy where the population considered at risk comprised all thyroid cancer patients detected during the years 1981-1991 in Israel was 8.95 (95% confidence limits 2.26-35.16). Literature review disclosed five additional similar cases. The mean radioiodine dose given to the seven CML patients was 11416MBq (range 1134-32130 MBq), considerably lower than the dose given to patients reported in the literature who subsequently developed acute leukaemias (mean 34965, range 3856-54810 MBq). We suggest that CML is a potential complication of low dose 131I therapy given for thyroid carcinoma even at the lower end of the dose range used for this indication. Leucocytosis appearing in these patients should raise the suspicion of secondary CML.\n",
      "Granulocytic sarcoma is an extramedullary tumour of primitive granulocytic cells. It can develop at any anatomic site and is often a forerunner to the development of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Granulocytic sarcoma of the small intestine presents with abdominal pain and obstruction. We report a case of a 17-years-old boy who presented with epigastric pain. His endoscopy revealed multiple polypoid lesions throughout the duodenum and small bowel. Histopathology and flow cytometery confirmed the diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma associated with acute myelogenous leukaemia. To our knowledge there have been only two previous case reports of multiple granulocytic sarcomas in the small intestine, both of these were adult patients. This is the first patient in the paediatric age group with multiple granulocytic sarcomas of the small intestine.\n",
      "Advances in both allogeneic marrow transplantation and conventional therapy for acute leukaemia have complicated the choice between bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and other remission treatment options. Because older patients may be more susceptible to BMT-related complications, this study analysed the effect of age on clinical outcome for 149 patients with acute leukaemia in remission receiving allogeneic BMT. Overall projected relapse-free survival at 3 years post-transplant is equivalent for 48 adults (18 years or older) and 101 children (less than 18) at 45.4% (31.1-59.6; 95% confidence interval) and 39.9% (30.1-49.7; 95% C.I.), respectively. Among 73 patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) 35.3% of adults and 30.1% of children survive relapse-free at 3 years. Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated that higher diagnostic white count, but not pre-transplant extramedullary leukaemia, remission number, or age, was important as an independent adverse clinical prognostic factor for patients with ALL. Overall outcome was better for 76 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 51.6% of adults and 52.9% of children surviving relapse-free at 3 years post-transplant. Cox multivariate regression analysis identified first remission status and lower white cell count, but not patient age, as independent predictors of improved relapse-free survival for AML patients. Adults had greater transplant morbidity, predominantly related to a higher incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), resulting in longer hospital stay. Survival at 100 d, long-term survival and clinical performance status were similar in both age groups. These data suggest that results of allogeneic BMT for adults with acute leukaemia compare favourably with those found in children and are superior to most reports of conventional chemotherapy. Allogeneic BMT remains a reasonable option for remission acute leukaemia patients up to the age of 45.\n",
      "In patients with acute leukaemia, studies of minimal residual disease (MRD) provide powerful and independent prognostic information. Multiparameter flow cytometry is a widely applicable and reliable approach for monitoring MRD. Using triple or quadruple marker combinations, aberrant or uncommon phenotypic profiles can be identified in about 80% of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 95% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). These profiles can reveal leukaemic cells even when these are not evident by morphological analysis. Thus, one leukaemic cell among 1000-10000 normal bone marrow or peripheral blood cells can be routinely detected. In this chapter we discuss technical aspects of MRD detection by flow cytometry and summarize results of correlative studies between MRD, clinical and biological features of leukaemia and treatment outcome. Current knowledge indicates that MRD studies using well-tested methodologies are clinically useful and should be incorporated into the clinical management of patients with acute leukaemia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: A long-held view links higher socioeconomic status (SES) to higher rates of childhood leukaemia. Some recent studies exhibit associations in the opposite direction. METHODS: We reviewed journal literature through August 2002 for associations between childhood leukaemia and socioeconomic measures. We determined the direction of each association and its P-value. We described the results with regard to study design, calendar period, geographic locale, and level of the socioeconomic measures (individual or ecological). For measures with sufficient number of results, we computed summary P-values across studies. RESULTS: Case-control studies conducted in North America since 1980 have involved subject interviews or self-administered questionnaires and have consistently reported inverse (negative) associations of childhood leukaemia with individual-level measures of family income, mother education, and father education. In contrast, associations have been consistently positive with father occupational class in record-based case-control studies and with average occupational class in ecological studies. CONCLUSIONS: Connections of SES measures to childhood leukaemia are likely to vary with place and time. Validation studies are needed to estimate SES-related selection and participation in case-control studies. Because different socioeconomic measures (such as income and education) and individual-level and ecological-level measures may represent different risk factors, we advise researchers to report these measures separately rather than in summary indices of social class.\n",
      "Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) describes a technique whereby RNA is first reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the enzyme reverse transcriptase, and the resulting cDNA amplified in either a single-step or a two-step nested PCR reaction. It is particularly useful for detecting molecular markers associated with leukaemia, as it enables a single assay to be used for many patients, each with unique genomic translocation breakpoints, but who have common fusion points in mRNA. This molecular method can not only detect aberrations that are cytogenetically cryptic, such as t(12;21)(p13;q22) in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but is also very sensitive, and as such can be used to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD). Detecting and measuring MRD is important because it can be a guide to determining prognosis and relapse risk, predict recurrence of leukaemia, and enable individualization of treatment.\n",
      "FLT3 overexpression is a recurrent event in various acute leukaemia subtypes. This transcriptional deregulation is important to define the prognostic risk for many patients. Of note, the molecular mechanisms leading to this gene upregulation are unknown for a substantial number of cases. In this Mini-Review, we highlight the role of FLT3 overexpression in acute leukaemia and discuss emerging mechanisms accounting for this upregulation. The benefits of using targeted therapy are also addressed in the overexpression context, posing other therapeutic possibilities based on state-of-the-art knowledge that could be considered for future research.\n",
      "We describe two patients with positive t(15;17) acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) that developed into a therapy-related myelodysplasia 2-2.5 years after complete remission (CR) and then evolved into therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML). Both patients received anthracyclines as potential leukaemogenic drugs. In both cases, cytogenetic changes usually occurring after use of alkylating agents were noticed: monosomy 7 associated with monosomy 5 or 5q- chromosome. A review of the literature on t-AML occurring after successful therapy for APL showed only one report similar to these two cases. These observations suggest that anthracyclines can cause t-AML similar to that induced by alkylating agents.\n",
      "Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) is essential for homing and maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells in distinct stromal cell niches within the marrow. Chemotactic responsiveness of haematopoietic stem cells is restricted to the ligand for CXCR4, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), which is constitutively secreted by marrow stromal cells. Myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia cells also express CXCR4 that induces leukaemia cell chemotaxis and migration beneath marrow stromal cells. CXCR4 expression levels have a major prognostic impact in acute myeloid leukaemia. There is growing in vitro and in vivo evidence that CXCR4 expression by leukaemia cells allows for homing and their retention within the marrow. As such, leukaemia cells appear to utilise CXCR4 to access niches that are normally restricted to progenitor cells, and thereby reside in a microenvironment that favours their growth and survival. CXCR4- and integrin-mediated contact between leukaemia cells and stromal cells protects leukaemia cells from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced cell death and therefore may represent a mechanism to explain minimal residual disease and subsequent relapses commonly seen in the treatment of these diseases. This review summarises our current knowledge regarding the importance of CXCR4 in acute and chronic leukaemia, discusses the importance of CXCR4 detection by flow cytometry in the diagnostic workup of leukaemia patients, and introduces the potential role of CXCR4-targeting compounds for the treatment of leukaemia patients.\n",
      "Survival rates among children with leukaemia in low-income countries are lower than those in high-income countries. This has been attributed in part to higher treatment-related mortality (TRM). We examined the demographics, treatment, and outcomes of paediatric patients in El Salvador with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to determine the incidence, causes, and risk factors for TRM. Two trained data managers collected data prospectively; no patients were excluded. Biological, socioeconomic and nutritional predictors were examined. A total of 469 patients with ALL and 78 patients with AML were included. The 2-year cumulative incidence of TRM was significantly higher among children with AML (35.4+/-6.4%) than those with ALL (12.5+/-1.7%; P<0.0001). However, the proportion of deaths attributable to the toxicity of treatment did not differ significantly between AML (25/47, 53.2%) and ALL (55/107, 51.4%; P=0.98). Among children with ALL, low monthly income (P=0.04) and low parental education (P=0.02) significantly increased the risk of TRM. Among children with AML, biological, socioeconomic, and nutritional variables were not associated with TRM. In this low-income country, toxic death significantly contributes to mortality in both ALL and AML. A better understanding of the effect of socioeconomic status on TRM may suggest specific strategies for patients with ALL.\n",
      "Advances in digital pathology have allowed a number of opportunities such as decision support using artificial intelligence (AI). The application of AI to digital pathology data shows promise as an aid for pathologists in the diagnosis of haematological disorders. AI-based applications have embraced benign haematology, diagnosing leukaemia and lymphoma, as well as ancillary testing modalities including flow cytometry. In this review, we highlight the progress made to date in machine learning applications in haematopathology, summarise important studies in this field, and highlight key limitations. We further present our outlook on the future direction and trends for AI to support diagnostic decisions in haematopathology.\n",
      "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been known as a multiple function factor, which also stimulates early haematopoiesis. In this study, we found that HGF was expressed at both the RNA and protein levels in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). In patients with AML (n = 20) and CML (n = 5), bone marrow plasma HGF concentrations were 20.44 +/- 6.26 (mean +/- s.e.) ng ml-1 and 7.17 +/- 0.53 ng ml-1 respectively. These were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the value for normal subjects (n = 26): mean 0.92 +/- 0.09 ng ml-1. Constitutive HGF production was observed in freshly prepared leukaemic blast cells from three patients with high HGF levels of bone marrow plasma. Expression of HGF mRNA was correlated with bone marrow plasma HGF levels. After complete remission was obtained in six patients, bone marrow plasma HGF levels were significantly decreased. In contrast, the HGF mRNA was less abundantly expressed in acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL). In patients with ALL (n = 5), bone marrow plasma HGF concentration (0.69 +/- 0.14 ng ml-1) remained low within the value for normal subjects. These results suggest that some populations of myeloid lineage cells have the ability to produce HGF.\n",
      "Noncoding somatic mutations have been demonstrated to play important role in tumourigenesis. Here we show that there exists an acute myeloid leukaemia associated noncoding somatic mutation at 3' terminal of conserved HOXA cluster. The mutation was identified in the bone marrow blasts but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells or buccal cells of two M3 (acute promyelocytic leukaemia, APL) type patients from 45 acute myeloid leukaemia patients. The mutation also existed in a pair of twins one of them developed acute myeloid leukaemia M4 (acute myelomonocytic leukaemia) type. The mutation resides in about 2-kb downstream of HOXA1 gene where a functional retinoic acid response element is located and also bound by histone demethylase KDM3B. Reporter assay showed that the mutation results in the upregulation of transcriptional activity and unresponsiveness to retinoic acid receptor. To sum up, we identified a new acute myeloid leukaemia associated noncoding somatic mutation.\n",
      "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) with intracytoplasmic inclusions is a rare and unusual subtype of acute leukaemia. Here we describe a case of ALL with intracytoplasmic inclusions in an adult female. These inclusions stained negative for Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Sudan Black B (SBB) and Alpha-naphthyl acetate estarase (ANAE) and positive for Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS). This case is being presented for its unusual occurrence and to recognise the characteristics of this subtype of ALL to avoid a misdiagnosis of AML (Acute Myeloid Leukaemia).\n",
      "The association between bovine major histocompatibility system (BoLA) type and persistent lymphocytosis in cattle with antibodies to bovine leukaemia virus was examined by comparing antigen frequencies in cattle with persistent lymphocytosis to controls matched for age, sex, breed and presence of antibodies to BLV. The cattle came from nine dairy herds in south-east Queensland, Australia; six herds were Australian Illawarra Shorthorn (AIS), two herds were Jersey and one herd was Friesian. Antigen W6 and Eu28R were more common in cattle with persistent lymphocytosis than in controls. Antigen W8 was less common in AIS cattle with persistent lymphocytosis. A study of 24 offspring from one sire, heterozygous for W10 and Eu28R, showed that offspring inheriting Eu28R from the sire were significantly more likely to have antibodies to BLV than offspring inheriting the opposing W10 haplotype.\n",
      "An increase in the blood eosinophil count may occur in a number of disease states including allergies, parasitic infections, vascular disease and as a reaction to the presence of malignant tumours. This article defines those disorders that are not purely reactive, and describes in detail the diagnosis and features of clonal eosinophilic disorders and the hypereosinophilic syndrome. The clonal disorders that are associated with eosinophilia are discussed, in particular the acute and chronic eosinophilic leukaemias and clonal eosinophilias in association with acute myeloid leukaemia, myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes. Whether eosinophilia is produced by a clonal or reactive disorder, the end result can often be the same, i.e. end organ damage produced by sustained hypereosinophilia in the presence of eosinophil activation. When no cause for the eosinophilia leading to the end organ damage is found, this disease is termed 'idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome'. Its pathogenesis, clinical features and management are discussed with particular reference to the possibility of it being a T-cell-associated disorder.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Leukaemia is the eleventh commonest UK cancer. The four main subtypes have different clinical profiles, particularly between chronic and acute types. AIM: To identify the symptom profiles of chronic and acute leukaemia in adults in primary care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Matched case-control studies using Clinical Practice Research Datalink records. METHOD: Putative symptoms of leukaemia were identified in the year before diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was used for analysis, and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated to estimate risk. RESULTS: Of cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2009, 4655 were aged ≥40 years (2877 chronic leukaemia (CL), 937 acute leukaemia (AL), 841 unreported subtype). Ten symptoms were independently associated with CL, the three strongest being: lymphadenopathy (odds ratio [OR] 22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 13 to 36), weight loss (OR 3.0, 95% CI = 2.1 to 4.2), and bruising (OR 2.3, 95% CI = 1.6 to 3.2). Thirteen symptoms were independently associated with AL, the three strongest being: nosebleeds and/or bleeding gums (OR 5.7, 95% CI = 3.1 to 10), fever (OR 5.3, 95% CI = 2.7 to 10), and fatigue (OR 4.4, 95% CI = 3.3 to 6.0). No individual symptom or combination of symptoms had a PPV >1%. CONCLUSION: The symptom profiles of CL and AL have both overlapping and distinct features. This presents a dichotomy for GPs: diagnosis, by performing a full blood count, is easy; however, the symptoms of leukaemia are non-specific and of relatively low risk. This explains why many leukaemia diagnoses are unexpected findings.\n",
      "Australia has a population of 17.5 million people distributed in six states and two territories. The first allogeneic transplants were performed in the early 1970s. There are now 19 hospitals registered with the Australian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Data Registry. In 1992 a total of 478 transplant procedures were carried out, of which 228 were allografts and 250 were autografts. The principal indications for allografting were acute leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia; the principal indications for autografting were non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia and myeloma. In general the patterns of indications and donor use do not differ from those seen in most European countries and North America.\n",
      "Lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells are being considered as a new and promising form of immunotherapy in the management of patients with solid tumours. Few informations are instead available on these cytotoxic effectors in haematological neoplasias. Here we shall discuss the possible role of LAK cells in human leukaemias. Evidence will be provided for a rationale in the clinical exploitment of Interleukin 2 (IL2)/LAK cells in the treatment of acute leukaemia patients, whilst the implication of these cytotoxic populations appears more uncertain in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Previous reports have indicated an excess of leukaemia in Broome County, New York, particularly in the Town of Union. Surveillance of cancer incidence data indicates that a large proportion of these cases occurred among males ages 65 and older. Shoe and boot manufacturing has been the largest single industry in this area throughout much of the past century. Occupational studies from Europe suggest a link between leukaemia and employment in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry. However, researchers have not found a positive association between leukaemia and employment in the shoe industry among workers in the United States. METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between leukaemia incidence among males 65 and older and employment in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry. Thirty-six cases of leukaemia occurring between 1981-1990; among males age 65 and older; residing in the town of Union met the study case criteria. Death certificates were obtained for each of the cases. These were matched to death certificates of 144 controls on date of death and date of birth +/- 1 year. Death certificates were then examined to determine the employer and occupation of each study subject. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the risk of leukaemia among those working in the industry. RESULTS: The risk of both leukaemia (OR = 1.47; 95% CI 0.70, 3.09) and acute myeloid leukaemia (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 0.33, 4.28) were elevated among those employed in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry, however neither was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results, though suggestive of an association between leukaemia and employment in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry, were not statistically conclusive due mainly to limited study power. Several additional limitations may also have prevented the observance of more conclusive findings. Better exposure assessment, information on length of exposure and types of job held, control of confounding factors and information on chemicals used by this company would strengthen any future investigation.\n",
      "Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells responsible for the initiation of primary antigen-specific immune responses. In chronic myeloid leukaemia DC have been generated from Ph+ cells and these Ph+ DC are capable of stimulating cytolytic T-cell responses against the parent leukaemia cells. The prevalence of this phenomenon in acute leukaemia (AL) is unknown and we have therefore studied a variety of acute leukaemias to determine their potential for DC development. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 21 cases of AL were cultured in GM-CSF + TNF alpha. Of these cases, 15 were viable in culture and cells with typical DC morphology were observed in 12 of these 15 cases. DC growing in culture expressed either CDla and/or CD83 and were HLA-DR+ CD40+ CD80+ CD86+ typical of mature DC. In 9/12 cases the cultured cells possessed potent antigen-presenting capacity as measured in the allo-MLR. The malignant origin of the cultured DC was confirmed by FISH analysis in two cases (one 5q- and one Ph+ AL) and by persistent aberrant expression of CD19 in two cases of biphenotypic leukaemia. Functional DC may be derived from AL blasts in a significant number of patients and such DC may be capable of inducing leukaemia-specific immune responses with potential for clinically beneficial effects.\n",
      "In this chapter, we apply the molecular epidemiological paradigm of biomarkers of exposure, early effect and susceptibility to causal models of leukaemia and lymphoma. The aim is to enhance the development of biomarkers for use in studying the causes of these haematopoeitic cancers in the general population. Two causal models of acute myeloid leukaemia are discussed in detail: chemotherapy-induced and benzene-induced acute myeloid leukaemia. Specific chromosomal changes found in acute myeloid leukaemia may serve as useful biomarkers of early effect in these models, and genetic variants in glutathione S-transferases, NQO1 and DNA-repair enzymes may serve as useful biomarkers of susceptibility. Several causal models of lymphoma exist in which biomarkers could be developed and validated. These include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunosuppression, families with inherited disorders and workers exposed to petroleum products, pesticides or organochlorines. Biomarkers of early effect could include markers of DNA double-strand breaks and aberrant V(D)J recombination, and susceptibility may be related to polymorphisms in genes controlling DNA repair and immunological status. We predict that biomarkers of susceptibility will continue to be studied in the case-control format, perhaps in large pooled studies, but that for biomarkers of early effect, there will be a move away from the study of diseased populations to the study of individuals 'at risk' in the causal models described above.\n",
      "AIMS: To investigate whether the antigen levels of the B cell lineage markers CD19 and CD20 can distinguish between normal and neoplastic B cells or characterise distinct expression patterns among the chronic B cell leukaemias. METHODS: Peripheral blood cells from 70 patients with B cell disorders and 17 healthy donors were analysed by quantitative flow cytometry. Direct immunofluorescence staining was performed with phycoerythrin conjugated CD19 and CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Standard microbeads with different capacities to bind mouse immunoglobulins were used to convert the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values into number of antigen molecules/cell, expressed as antibody binding capacity (ABC). RESULTS: CD19 and CD20 ABC values in leukaemic B cells differed from those of normal blood B lymphocytes. The results identified distinct profiles of CD19 and CD20 expression in the various types of B cell leukaemias. In all leukaemias studied except hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), CD19 expression was significantly lower than the mean (SD) value in normal B cells (22 (7) x 10(3) molecules/cell), as follows: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 13 (7) x 10(3); B prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-PLL), 16 (9) x 10(3); splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL), 15 (11) x 10(3); mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 10 (7) x 10(3). In HCL there was strong CD19 expression (38 (16) x 10(3)). In contrast, the level of expression of membrane CD20 was higher than the mean (SD) value in normal B cells (94 (16) x 10(3) molecules/cell) in MCL (123 (51) x 10(3)); B-PLL (129 (47) x 10(3)); SLVL (167 (72) x 10(3)); and HCL (312 (110) x 10(3)); while it was significantly lower (65 (11) x 10(3)) in CLL compared with normal B cells and the other B cell leukaemias. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative determination of CD19 and CD20 may provide useful diagnostic information for the study of B lymphoproliferative disorders.\n",
      "Haematopoiesis is controlled by a number of growth factors and cytokines, a number of which act through binding to high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Approximately 20 different RTK classes have been identified, all of which share a similar structure that includes a ligand binding extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Recent studies have linked an increasing number of mutations in the RTKs to the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic leukaemia. For example, the FLT3 receptor, a RTK class III, is the most commonly mutated gene in acute myeloid leukaemia, while c-kit mutations are strongly linked to the development of mast cell malignancy. This review summarizes the RTK classes that are known to be expressed on normal haematopoietic tissue and highlights the many 'gain-of-function' mutations involved in leukaemogenesis. It is to be hoped that this knowledge will provide important new insights for targeted therapy in leukaemia.\n",
      "Anti-leukaemia activity after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been studied extensively but its antigen specificity and effector cell phenotype remain unknown. Here we report a study in three recipients of autologous bone marrow transplantation done as part of the treatment for acute leukaemia, in whom we were able to detect innate specific anti-leukaemia activity post-transplant. One patient maintained selective cell-mediated cytolytic activity against her autologous leukaemic cells in the absence of cytolysis of her normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC). She remains in complete remission 3 years after ABMT for acute myeloid leukaemia (M5). A second patient was transplanted for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and had detectable anti-leukaemia activity up to 20 weeks post-ABMT. At this point anti-leukaemia activity could no longer be demonstrated and the patient suffered a relapse 2 weeks later. A third patient was transplanted for AML (M4 Eo) and lacked detectable leukaemia-specific immune reactivity at 1, 3 and 6 months post-ABMT. She relapsed 6 months after her ABMT and returned to complete remission after further chemotherapy. She commenced treatment with alpha interferon and regained NK function. Furthermore, she developed high level cytolytic activity against her autologous leukaemic cells in the absence of activity against her remission bone marrow samples. She remains in complete remission 17 months after her initial relapse. This is the first report of an apparent association between in vitro leukaemia-specific cytolytic activity in individual patients after ABMT and clinical outcome. It encourages the theory that autologous immunomodulation may be useful in the future treatment of leukaemia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To analyse trends in incidence rates of acute leukaemia in patients aged 15 and over admitted to hospital. DESIGN: A descriptive epidemiological study. SETTING: University teaching hospital, Haematology Clinic, Skopje. RESULTS: The crude incidence rates of acute leukaemia in adults during this period increased substantially (p for overall trend < 0.001). The lowest crude incidence rates (CIR) were observed in 1996 (CIR = 1.64/100 000; 95% Confidence Interval CI = 1.1-2.4), while the highest were noted in 2003 (CIR = 3.76/100 000; 95% CI = 2.9-4.8). In 1993 the sex ratio of the incidence rates (males to females) was Rate Ratio (RR) = 2.23, while as of 2001 the association between sexes disappeared (RR = 1). The trend in males was not significant (p = 0.160), while in females it showed a monotonic increase that was highly significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During a short period of time (11 years) we have noted an increase in the incidence rates of acute leukaemia in our population aged 15 years and above. The study suggests that this could be due to increased risk in females, and in adults over 40 years. In addition, according to the census results in 1994 and 2002 the proportion of people aged 65 and above increased by 30.5% implying that this demographic change could account for part of the relative increase in the incidence rates of acute leukaemia. Further analytic studies are needed to address the possible causes of these changes. What is already known on this topic: The risk of acute leukaemia increases by age and it is higher in males than in females. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The incidence rates are equal between the sexes; the increase in risk of acute leukemia in females could be due to environmental risk factor.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) affects children and adults of all ages. AML remains one of the major causes of death in children with cancer and for children with AML relapse is the most common cause of death. Here, by modelling AML in vivo we demonstrate that AML is discriminated by the age of the cell of origin. Young cells give rise to myeloid, lymphoid or mixed phenotype acute leukaemia, whereas adult cells give rise exclusively to AML, with a shorter latency. Unlike adult, young AML cells do not remodel the bone marrow stroma. Transcriptional analysis distinguishes young AML by the upregulation of immune pathways. Analysis of human paediatric AML samples recapitulates a paediatric immune cell interaction gene signature, highlighting two genes, RGS10 and FAM26F as prognostically significant. This work advances our understanding of paediatric AML biology, and provides murine models that offer the potential for developing paediatric specific therapeutic strategies.\n",
      "The growth and maturation of haemopoietic cells is regulated by signal transduction through tyrosine protein kinases. Recently, a novel cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X, called Bmx, was identified in human bone marrow RNA. Bmx belongs to a subfamily of tyrosine kinases which are expressed in various haemopoietic cell lineages. We studied Bmx expression using RT-PCR of RNA from fractionated peripheral blood leucocytes, progenitor-enriched fractions of cord blood and from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from leukaemia patients. Bmx was strongly expressed in haemopoietic tissues and enhanced in neutrophilic granulocytes. Bmx mRNA was also found in CD34-positive progenitor cells from cord blood. All samples (10/10) of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and (4/4) with chronic myeloid leukaemia showed expression of Bmx. In contrast, none of the samples of acute lymphoid leukaemia (0/8) and only one out of six samples of chronic lymphoid leukaemia expressed Bmx. In conclusion, Bmx expression seems to be associated with myelopoiesis.\n",
      "The incidence, malignancy and treatment resistance of many types of human B-cell leukaemias (B-ALL) are directly related to patient age. A major obstacle to elucidate the contribution of age to the development and evolution of leukaemias is the lack of appropriate mouse models where precise control of the timing of oncogene expression is possible. Here we present proof-of-principle experiments showing how a conditional transgenic mouse model of BCR-ABLp190-driven B-ALL offers the opportunity to test the hypothesis that the age of the leukemic cells-of-origin of B-ALL influences B-ALL malignancy. B-ALLs generated from 12- and 20-month-old progenitors gave rise to a more invasive B-ALL than the one developed from 4-month old precursors. This was evidenced by survival analysis revealing the increased malignancy of B-ALLs generated from 20 or 12-month-old transformed progenitors compared with the 4-month equivalents (median survival of 88 days versus 50.5 and 33 days, respectively). Our study shows that the age of target cells at the time of transformation affects B-ALL malignancy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Paternal occupational exposures have been proposed as a risk factor for childhood leukaemia. This study investigates possible associations between paternal occupational exposure and childhood leukaemia in Great Britain. METHODS: The National Registry of Childhood Tumours provided all cases of childhood leukaemia born and diagnosed in Great Britain between 1962 and 2006. Controls were matched on sex, period of birth and birth registration subdistrict. Fathers' occupations were assigned to 1 or more of 33 exposure groups. Social class was derived from father occupation at the time of the child birth. RESULTS: A total of 16 764 cases of childhood leukaemia were ascertained. One exposure group, paternal social contact, was associated with total childhood leukaemia (odds ratio 1.14, 1.05-1.23); this association remained significant when adjusted for social class. The subtypes lymphoid leukaemia (LL) and acute myeloid leukaemia showed increased risk with paternal exposure to social contact before adjustment for social class. Risk of other leukaemias was significantly increased by exposure to electromagnetic fields, persisting after adjustment for social class. For total leukaemia, the risks for exposure to lead and exhaust fumes were significantly <1. Occupationally derived social class was associated with risk of LL, with the risk being increased in the higher social classes. CONCLUSION: Our results showed some support for a positive association between childhood leukaemia risk and paternal occupation involving social contact. Additionally, LL risk increased with higher paternal occupational social class.\n",
      "Ten per cent of children entered into the national leukaemia study UKALL VIII were under 2 years at diagnosis. The 6 year event-free survival of this cohort was 39%. Specific adverse features were age under 1 year, high initial white cell count and null cell ALL. Those with common ALL, WBC 10-50 x 10(9) 1-1 and especially those aged 18 months or older did not have an adverse prognosis compared with the whole trial entrants. Overall, however there was a doubling of CNS relapse rate and of both induction and remission deaths. Those with a WBC under 10 x 10(9) 1-1 had a high haematological relapse rate. The type of leukaemia and method of management rather than specifically the age appeared to be the predictor for poor outcome.\n",
      "A three-year-old cat with lymphadenopathy, non-regenerative anaemia and marked leucocytosis (171.3 x 10(9) white blood cells/l) was diagnosed with monocytic leukaemia and treated with a combination of anticancer drugs. A number of mature and immature monocyte-like cells were detected in the peripheral blood and bone marrow; they proved to be monocytic cells by cytochemical examination and an analysis of their cell surface phenotype, indicating that the cat suffered from acute myeloid leukaemia, subclassified as monocytic leukaemia (M5). Treatment with cytarabine, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone greatly reduced the number of blast cells in the cat peripheral blood and bone marrow. The cat was in partial remission for 67 days and survived for 95 days after it was first examined.\n",
      "Over the last few years, both synchrotron-based FTIR (S-FTIR) and Raman microspectroscopies have helped to better understand the effects of drugs on cancer cells. However, cancer is a mixture of cells with different sensitivity/resistance to drugs. Furthermore, the effects of drugs on cells produce both chemical and morphological changes, the latter could affect the spectra of cells incubated with drugs. Here, we successfully cloned sensitive and resistant leukaemia cells to nilotinib, a drug used in the management of leukaemia. This allowed both the study of a more uniform population and the study of sensitive and resistant cells prior to the addition of the drug with both S-FTIR and Raman microspectroscopies. The incubation with nilotinib produced changes in the S-FTIR and Raman spectra of both sensitive and resistant clones to nilotinib. Principal component analysis was able to distinguish between cells incubated in the absence or presence of the drug, even in the case of resistant clones. The latter would confirm that the spectral differences between the so-called resistant clonal cells prior to and after adding a drug might reside on those more or less sensitive cells that have been able to remain alive when they were collected to be studied with S-FTIR or Raman microspectroscopies. The data presented here indicate that the methodology of cell cloning can be applied to different types of malignant cells. This should facilitate the identification of spectral biomarkers of sensitivity/resistance to drugs. The next step would be a better assessment of sensitivity/resistance of leukaemia cells from patients which could guide clinicians to better tailor treatments to each individual patient.\n",
      "We have analysed the expression of HLA-G in 40 leukaemia samples of various subtypes [seven cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 28 cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), three cases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and two cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)] by flow cytometry using HLA-G-specific monoclonal antibody. No leukaemia samples expressed HLA-G without incubation with interferon (IFN)-gamma. However, six out of 28 (21%) AML samples expressed HLA-G upon incubation with IFN-gamma. These six samples derived from one out of seven M2, two out of eight M4 and three out of five M5. The results indicated that AML cells, especially myelomonocytic leukaemia samples, are capable of expressing the HLA-G molecule.\n",
      "Experimental toxicological studies have offered clear evidence that benzene induces haematopoietic neoplasms, and it is generally accepted that exposure to benzene is a risk factor for leukaemia, in particular for acute non-lymphatic leukaemia. Quantitative aspects of benzene risk assessment are still a matter of controversy, however. In several risk assessments an estimated 50 deaths from leukaemia per 1000 deaths would arise from exposures to benzene of 10 ppm during a working life of 30 years. The assessment presented in this paper leads to lower estimates, which are more in agreement with the weak toxicological data. Furthermore, an approach is presented to incorporate the results of low exposure epidemiological studies into the process of quantitative risk assessment.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Advances in therapy and supportive care have improved the outlook for many patients with acute leukaemia, however elderly patients have increased treatment-related toxicity and shorter survival. Most clinical trials have selected patient populations with young median ages and it is therefore difficult to apply results to the general population where the majority of patients presenting with acute leukaemia are over 60 years. There is little information in the literature guiding appropriate treatment of these patients. AIMS: To determine the relationship between age, treatment received, and outcome in patients presenting with acute leukaemia. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients presenting to Prince Henry Hospital and Monash Medical Centre with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) during a five year period. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (51-AML, 15-ALL) presented with acute leukaemia between March 1989 and April 1994. Median patient age was 63 years; 32% of patients received supportive therapy only; 86% of patients with ALL and 58% of patients with AML commencing remission-induction chemotherapy entered a complete remission. Median survival for patients receiving only supportive therapy was three months. Median survival in patients under 55 years was almost twice as long as patients over 55 years receiving similar treatment (AML-eight vs four months p = 0.023; ALL-3.5 vs seven months p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Median survival for acute leukaemia is inversely proportional to age. Applying results from selected series to elderly patients with acute leukaemia is inappropriate.\n",
      "Fifty-four cases of adult acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) were studied. Their main symptoms were weakness and easy fatiguability (80%), fever (78%) and bleeding manifestation (48.38%). Our patients were younger (median age 34 years) and the disease was more advanced at the time of presentation than that seen in the West. FAB morphological classification of adult ANLL cases showed M2 (44.44%) the most predominant type followed by M4 (24%), M5 and M6 were less common (3.7%). Majority of ANLL cases (68.51%) occurred up to the age of 40 years. Our results are comparable to European and consistent with Pakistani and Libyan studies.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation of clonal small mature-looking lymphocytes, usually of B cell origin. In addition to a better understanding of many biological features, during the last 10-15 years a great progress has been made in the prognostic characterization of the disease. The therapeutic achievements, however, have been less impressive. The possibility to identify patients with different prognosis has renewed interest in the treatment of this disorder. A considerable number of controlled trials have been performed or are in course, and new perspectives for CLL treatment are emerging. Basically four different kinds of measures are used: 1) chemotherapy, 2) radiotherapy, 3) adjuvant measures and 4) new modalities.\n",
      "The efficient detection of chromosomal aberrations in childhood acute leukaemias presents a significant component in the diagnostics of this frequent malignant disease. We used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH) to determine the frequency of chromosomal changes in 33 children with acute leukaemia (AL). The yields of chromosomal abnormalities were compared with the results obtained using conventional cytogenetics (G-banding) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Conventional cytogenetics revealed chromosomal changes in 17 (52 %) of studied patients. The employment of FISH together with G-banding analysis identified chromosomal changes in 27 (82 %) of the AL patients investigated. CGH detected changes in DNA copy numbers in 24 (73 %) patients, 40 losses and 67 gains were found in total. HR-CGH disclosed 98 losses and 97 gains in 26 (79 %) patients. In comparison with CGH, HR-CGH analyses unveiled 88 new chromosomal aberrations: 58 losses and 30 gains. The most commonly gained chromosomes were 21 (22.5 %), X (15 %), 18 (12,5 %) and 17 (10 %). The most common losses involved sub-regions or arms of chromosomes 7 (15 %), 9 (12.5 %), 16, 19 and 1 (10 % each). Cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analyses of 33 childhood acute leukaemias revealed chromosomal changes in total 31 (94 %) patients. The evaluation of HR-CGH sensitivity proved that the minimal cell population of malignant cells in which a certain chromosomal change could be found was close to the 20 - 30 % level. Our results confirm the benefits of HR-CGH in detecting chromosomal changes in childhood AL. Supplementing G-banding and FISH with the HR-CGH diagnostic method increases the detection of unbalanced structural chromosomal rearrangements and can reveal small cell clones with gains and losses of whole chromosomes in hyperdiploid AL.\n",
      "Polymorphisms within the phase II metabolizer enzymes GST T1, GST M1 and GST P1 affect the body ability to detoxify a range of potential leukaemogens encountered in the environment. Using PCR, GST T1, GST M1 and GST P1 genotypes were determined in 557 adults with acute leukaemia and 952 age, sex and geographically matched controls. The strongest association with acute leukaemia was observed for the GST T1 null genotype, which occurred among 19% of cases and 14% of controls [odds ratio (OR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.93]. A slightly higher proportion of cases (53%) than controls (49%) displayed the GST M1 null genotype, although the difference was not statistically significant (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.98-1.52). No effect was observed for the GST P1 genotype and no interaction between the GST T1 and GST M1 genotypes was evident. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was weakly associated with both GST T1 null (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.97-1.79) and GST M1 null (OR 1. 24, 95% CI 0.98-1.56), whereas acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was associated with GST T1 null (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.31-8.26). No associations between smoking and disease risk in relation to GST T1 and GST M1 polymorphic status were found.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To study incidence and mortality of leukaemias, cancer of the larynx, and other cancers near the petrochemical plant at Baglan Bay, in response to local concerns of an alleged cluster of cancers in the vicinity. METHODS: This is a small area study of cancer incidence, 1974-84 and of mortality, 1981-91 based on the national postcoded data held by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit and with population and socioeconomic data from the 1981 census. The study is centred on BP Chemicals Ltd, Baglan Bay, Port Talbot, West Glamorgan, South Wales and includes a general population sample of 115,721 people (1981 census) living within 7.5 km of the plant. Cancer incidence and mortality for all cancers, leukaemias, and cancer of the larynx were examined within 7.5 km and 3 km of the plant, and tests for decline in risk of these cancers with distance from the plant were carried out. Mortality from several other cancers possibly associated with the petrochemical industry was also studied. RESULTS: There were 5417 incident cancer cases and 2458 cancer deaths within 7.5 km of the plant during the periods of study. There was an 8% excess incidence of all cancers within 7.5 km, and a 24% excess of cancer of the larynx, consistent with a general excess of these cancers in West Glamorgan, but no apparent decline in incidence with distance from the plant, nor excess mortality. There was also no evidence of decline in leukaemia incidence or mortality with distance, at all ages or in children. Among the other causes included in the mortality study, there was an excess of multiple myeloma within 7.5 km, especially among women, and a significant decline in mortality from non-Hodgkin lymphomas although there was no excess overall within 7.5 km. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent excess incidence of all cancers and cancer of the larynx within 7.5 km of the BP Chemical Ltd works was consistent with an excess more generally in West Glamorgan, possibly related, at least to some extent, to cancer registration in Wales. There was no excess mortality from these cancers. The results for multiple myeloma and especially non-Hodgkin lymphomas may have been chance findings in view of the multiple tests of significance carried out in the study. A study of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers near oil refineries in Great Britain is to be undertaken that will help put the findings of the present study in wider context.\n",
      "Between March 1983 and December 1985, six patients with haematological disorders (four acute nonlymphocytic leukaemias, one chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia and one severe aplastic anaemia have undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Four of the 6 patients are alive and free from disease between 33+ and 55+ months; two patients died due to grade IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD).\n",
      "AIMS: Near-tetraploidy/tetraploidy (NT/T) is a rare cytogenetic alteration in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). NT/T-AML is categorised as complex cytogenetics and therefore, presumed to have an unfavourable prognosis. Our aim is to further characterise the clinical, morphological, cytogenetic and prognostic features of NT/T-AML. METHODS: We searched our cytogenetic laboratory database from 1991 to 2012 to reveal 13 cases of NT/T-AML. Each case was evaluated with regard to its demographics, morphology, immunophenotype and prognosis. Specific morphological features included blast size, irregularity of nuclear contours, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and presence and lineage of dysplasia. RESULTS: Eleven men and two women had a median age of 68 years. Blasts were predominately large (11/13). Eight of 13 patients had AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Sixty-nine per cent of patients achieved complete remission (CR). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.6 months. CR rate and median OS in cases with ≥ 5 cytogenetic abnormalities were 71% and 6 months, compared with 67% and 18.1 months in cases with <5 abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: NT/T-AML occurs in older males, exhibits large blast size and is associated with myelodysplasia. Unlike previously reported data, our study reveals an overall better prognosis in this older population with NT/T-AML than was expected for a complex karyotype AML. Cytogenetic complexity independent of ploidy status did not greatly affect the high CR rates, but did appear to be a better estimation of prognostic risk in terms of median OS.\n",
      "PRAME (Preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma) has been previously identified as a melanoma antigen recognized by cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and found to be expressed in a variety of cancer cells including leukaemic cells. We have screened 98 Japanese patients with leukaemia and lymphoma for expression of the PRAME gene using semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Forty-one patients (42%) showed high levels of PRAME expression. Eight of these patients were then monitored using real-time PCR for a period of 10-37 months. Significant reductions in the PRAME expression were observed in all patients after chemotherapy. An increased expression was detected in the two patients who relapsed, one of which was before cytological diagnosis. These changes were correlated with those of other known genetic markers, such as the bcr-abl gene. Therefore, quantitative monitoring of the PRAME gene using real-time PCR method may be useful for detecting minimal residual disease and to predict subsequent relapse, especially in patients without known genetic markers. In addition, a PRAME-positive leukaemia cell line and fresh leukaemic cells were found to be susceptible to lysis by PRAME-specific CTLs established from a patient with melanoma, suggesting that the PRAME peptide can also be a target leukaemia antigen for T cells.\n",
      "DNA analysis has become of practical value in the diagnosis and classification of leukaemias and lymphomas. This is exemplified by the study of lymphoproliferative disorders using immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene probes for the determination of clonality and cell lineage. Chromosomal analysis with DNA probes is now a useful complementary approach to cytogenetics. For example, the study of particular lymphomas or chronic myelogenous leukaemia with DNA probes hybridising to specific chromosomal breakpoints allows the detection of chromosomal translocations at a genomic level. Chromosomal loss in neoplastic cells can be detected by DNA probes in individual heterozygous for particular restriction fragment length polymorphisms, most efficiently by locus-specific hypervariable region probles. These techniques will enable progress to be made in the understanding of the biology of remission and disease progression in haematological malignancies.\n",
      "For many years there was a widely accepted picture of how a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gives rise to the multiple types of blood and immune cells. This described the general nature of stem and progenitor cells and the pathways of cell development. Recent years have seen many attempts to re-draw the map of haematopoiesis. These have become increasingly complex, and they often envisage multiples routes to some cell types. The 'established' view that self-renewal in haematopoiesis only occurs in HSCs has been challenged by the recognition of self-renewing HSC-derived progenitor cells that display at least some fate restriction. This evolution of how normal haematopoiesis is viewed has inevitable implications for understanding the origins, disease progression and classification of the leukaemias. In essence, some progenitor cells are now seen as possessing a larger repertoire of routes to end-fates than was previously thought. This leads one to ask whether leukaemia stem cells are equally or less versatile than their normal counterparts?\n",
      "BACKGROUND: UK policy aims to improve cancer outcomes by promoting early diagnosis, which for many haematological malignancies is particularly challenging as the pathways leading to diagnosis can be difficult and prolonged. METHODS: A survey about symptoms was sent to patients in England with acute leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Symptoms and barriers to first help seeking were examined for each subtype, along with the relative risk of waiting >3 months' time from symptom onset to first presentation to a doctor, controlling for age, sex and deprivation. RESULTS: Of the 785 respondents, 654 (83.3%) reported symptoms; most commonly for NHL (95%) and least commonly for CLL (67.9%). Some symptoms were frequent across diseases while others were more disease-specific. Overall, 16% of patients (n=114) waited >3 months before presentation; most often in CML (24%) and least in acute leukaemia (9%). Significant risk factors for >3 months to presentation were: night sweats (particularly CLL and NHL), thirst, abdominal pain/discomfort, looking pale (particularly acute leukaemias), and extreme fatigue/tiredness (particularly CML and NHL); and not realising symptom(s) were serious. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate important differences by subtype, which should be considered in strategies promoting early presentation. Not realising the seriousness of some symptoms indicates a worrying lack of public awareness.\n",
      "For two decades, leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have been advanced paradigms for the cancer stem cell field. In CML, the acquisition of the fusion tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL1 in a haematopoietic stem cell drives its transformation to become a LSC. In AML, LSCs can arise from multiple cell types through the activity of a number of oncogenic drivers and pre-leukaemic events, adding further layers of context and genetic and cellular heterogeneity to AML LSCs not observed in most cases of CML. Furthermore, LSCs from both AML and CML can be refractory to standard-of-care therapies and persist in patients, diversify clonally and serve as reservoirs to drive relapse, recurrence or progression to more aggressive forms. Despite these complexities, LSCs in both diseases share biological features, making them distinct from other CML or AML progenitor cells and from normal haematopoietic stem cells. These features may represent Achilles' heels against which novel therapies can be developed. Here, we review many of the similarities and differences that exist between LSCs in CML and AML and examine the therapeutic strategies that could be used to eradicate them.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether experience of cancer in childhood leaves a hypersensitivity to various somatic symptoms. Further, are self-reported somatic symptoms explained by medical late-effects or a worry of recurrence of the cancer? METHODS: Of the total of 44 female survivors of leukaemia, 42 were compared with 69 age-matched healthy controls. We used a questionnaire to study self reported somatic symptoms and a face-to-face interview to explore worries about recurrence of the illness. Health status and medical late effects were evaluated by a paediatric haematologist. RESULTS: In contrast to our assumptions, young survivors of leukaemia reported fewer somatic symptoms than healthy age-matched comparison subjects (p < 0.001). Late physical sequelae were uncommon except in the survivors of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Of the survivors, 52% were afraid of recurrence of the illness. The presence of physical or visible impairment and worry of recurrence were unrelated to frequency of somatic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that experience of childhood leukaemia and its treatment does not result in increased somatic concerns or hypochondriacal tendencies.\n",
      "We analysed data obtained from the Hawaii Tumor Registry, a population-based participant in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programme that monitors cancer incidence and mortality for the entire state. A total of 138 males and 116 females, under the age of 15, were diagnosed with leukaemia between 1960 and 1984, with average annual age-adjusted incidence rates of 49.6 and 44.8 per million, respectively. Time trend analysis by 5-year calendar periods revealed an increasing rate for leukaemia among females only, whereas other populations have shown a positive trend in both sexes. The incidence rates for all ethnic groups combined were similar to those for US whites. Japanese and Chinese males had a slightly higher rate for leukaemia than US whites, while Filipinos, Hawaiians and whites in Hawaii had relatively lower rates. Among females, incidence was higher among whites, Filipinos, Hawaiians and Chinese than among US whites, and lower among Japanese. Thus, there were notable sex differences in the ethnic distribution of this disease.\n",
      "The clinical characteristics and prognostic relevance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with myelodysplastic features remains to be clarified in children. We prospectively examined 443 newly diagnosed patients in a multicentre clinical trial for paediatric de novo AML, and found 'AML with myelodysplasia-related changes' (AML-MRC) according to the 2008 World Health Organization classification in 93 (21·0%), in whom 59 were diagnosed from myelodysplasia-related cytogenetics alone, 28 from multilineage dysplasia alone and six from a combination of both. Compared with 111 patients with 'AML, not otherwise specified' (AML-NOS), patients with 'AML-MRC' presented at a younger age, with a lower white blood cell count, higher incidence of 20-30% bone marrow blasts, unfavourable cytogenetics and a lower frequency of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), NPM1 and CEBPA mutations. Complete remission rate and 3-year probability of event-free survival were significantly worse in 'AML-MRC' patients (67·7 vs. 85·6%, P < 0·01, 37·1% vs. 53·8%, P = 0·02, respectively), but 3-year overall survival and relapse-free survival were comparable with 'AML-NOS' patients. By multivariate analysis, FLT3-ITD was solely associated with worse overall survival. These results support the distinctive features of the category 'AML-MRC' even in children.\n",
      "Chromosome banding analysis is the gold standard method for the identification of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). It allows stratification of AML patients into subgroups with distinct responses to therapy and survival. Unfortunately, a variety of issues hamper cytogenetic evaluation in c. 10% of cases [unsuccessful cytogenetics (UC)] and the outcome of these patients is poorly understood. To better define the significance of UC in patients with AML, we compared the baseline characteristics and the prognostic impact of 94 (6%) patients, whose standard metaphase analysis yielded unacceptable results, to the remaining 1403 AML patients with successful cytogenetic analysis treated on successive Southwestern Oncology Group protocols. The incidence of UC increased with age, with peak incidence in patients older than 60 years. These patients had a lower response rate to induction chemotherapy (complete remission rate of 43%) and dismal 5-year survival rates (16%), which was especially poor in patients older than 60 years (<5%). The complete remission and survival rates were similar to those seen in patients with unfavourable karyotype. The early death rate was not increased. These results suggest that UC increases with age and predict for poor outcomes, similar to the outcomes of patients with unfavourable karyotype.\n",
      "Modern management of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) relies on the integration of phenotypic and genetic data to assign classification, establish prognosis, enhance monitoring and guide treatment. The prism through which we can now disperse a patient leukaemia, interpret and apply our understanding has fundamentally changed since the completion of the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of an AML patient in 2008 and where possible, many clinicians would now prefer to delay treatment decisions until the karyotype and genetic status of a new patient is known. The success of global sequencing initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have brought us significantly closer to cataloguing the full spectrum of coding mutations involved in human malignancy. Indeed, genetic capability has raced ahead of our capacity to apply much of this knowledge into clinical practice and we are in the peculiar position of having routine access to genetic information on an individual patient leukaemia that cannot be reliably interpreted or utilised. This is a measure of how rapid the progress has been, and this rate of change is likely to continue into the foreseeable future as research intensifies on the non-coding genome and the epigenome, as we scrutinise disease at a single cell level, and as initiatives like Beat AML and the Harmony Alliance progress. In this review, we will examine how interrogation of the coding genome is revolutionising our understanding of AML and improving our ability to underscore differences between paediatric and adult onset, sporadic and inherited forms of disease. We will look at how this knowledge is informing improvements in outcome prediction and the development of novel treatments, bringing us a step closer to personalised therapy for myeloid malignancy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: High benzene exposure causes acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Three petroleum case-control studies identified 60 cases (241 matched controls) for AML and 80 cases (345 matched controls) for chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL). METHODS: Cases were classified and scored regarding uncertainty by two haematologists using available diagnostic information. Blinded quantitative benzene exposure assessment used work histories and exposure measurements adjusted for era-specific circumstances. Statistical analyses included conditional logistic regression and penalised smoothing splines. RESULTS: Benzene exposures were much lower than previous studies. Categorical analyses showed increased ORs for AML with several exposure metrics, although patterns were unclear; neither continuous exposure metrics nor spline analyses gave increased risks. ORs were highest in terminal workers, particularly for Tanker Drivers. No relationship was found between benzene exposure and risk of CLL, although the Australian study showed increased risks in refinery workers. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study does not persuasively demonstrate a risk between benzene and AML. A previously reported strong relationship between myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (potentially previously reported as AML) at our study low benzene levels suggests that MDS may be the more relevant health risk for lower exposure. Higher CLL risks in refinery workers may be due to more diverse exposures than benzene alone.\n",
      "Blood formation, or haematopoiesis, originates from haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), whose functions and maintenance are regulated in both cell- and cell non-autonomous ways. The surroundings of HSCs in the bone marrow create a specific niche or microenvironment where HSCs nest that allows them to retain their unique characteristics and respond rapidly to external stimuli. Ageing is accompanied by reduced regenerative capacity of the organism affecting all systems, due to the progressive decline of stem cell functions. This includes blood and HSCs, which contributes to age-related haematological disorders, anaemia, and immunosenescence, among others. Furthermore, chronological ageing is characterised by myeloid and platelet HSC skewing, inflammageing, and expanded clonal haematopoiesis, which may be the result of the accumulation of preleukaemic lesions in HSCs. Intriguingly, haematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukaemia have a high incidence among elderly patients, yet not all individuals with clonal haematopoiesis develop leukaemias. Here, we discuss recent work on these aspects, their potential underlying molecular mechanisms, and the first cues linking age-related changes in the HSC niche to poor HSC maintenance. Future work is needed for a better understanding of haematopoiesis during ageing. This field may open new avenues for HSC rejuvenation and therapeutic strategies in the elderly.\n",
      "From June 1986 to June 1990, 64 patients with leukaemia (25 acute myelogenous leukaemia, 21 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 18 chronic myeloid leukaemia) undergoing marrow transplantation were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide (CY) and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) without lung shielding (n = 33) or CY and fractionated TBI with lung shielding (n = 31, control group) as conditioning. Patients conditioned with TBI without lung shielding received a significantly higher total lung dose compared with the control group (p less than 0.0001). The 3-year leukaemia-free survival for patients receiving TBI without lung shielding is 54 +/- 18% versus 51 +/- 18% for patients receiving TBI with lung shielding (p = ns). There was no significant difference in the probability of leukaemia relapse (22 +/- 18% for TBI without lung shielding versus 24 +/- 18% for control group; p = ns). The probability of interstitial pneumonitis is 15 +/- 14% for TBI without lung shielding and 5 +/- 5% for TBI with lung shielding (p = ns). A higher incidence of lung fungal infection (15 versus 3%) and interstitial pneumonitis (12 versus 3%) has been documented in patients receiving TBI without lung shielding compared with the control group. The results indicate that higher radiation dose to the lung did not increase antileukaemic efficacy of TBI but seemed to be associated with the increased pulmonary toxicity.\n",
      "We used an in vitro clonogenic assay in semi-solid medium to test the sensitivity of normal bone marrow and acute myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia progenitors to the flavonol quercetin. We have studied 14 acute myeloid (AML) and four acute lymphoid (ALL) leukaemias. All ALL and the vast majority of AML (12/14) had a high sensitivity to quercetin with more than 50% growth inhibition at 2 x 10(-6) M quercetin. One M3-AML was partially quercetin-sensitive displaying 60% surviving AML-colony forming units (CFU-AML) at a quercetin concentration of 10(-5) M. One M1-AML was resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of quercetin at a concentration of 2 x 10(-5) M. The clonogenic efficiency of both AML and ALL positively correlated with leukaemic colony-forming unit (CFU-L) sensitivity to quercetin suggesting that this parameter can be useful in predicting quercetin responsiveness of leukaemic cells. We have also studied the effect of various quercetin concentrations on colony formation by normal bone marrow cells. At a quercetin concentration of 10(-5) M, we observed (in five different experiments) a mean recovery of 53% and 65% of erythroid blast-forming units (BFU-E) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), respectively. Thus, normal bone marrow appeared partially resistant to quercetin, being inhibited less than 50% by quercetin concentration higher than 2 x 10(-5). When normal bone marrow were deprived in CD34+ haematopoietic progenitors the resultant population became highly sensitive to quercetin, with a mean recovery of BFU-E and CFU-GM of 5% and 12% of controls respectively in the presence of 2 x 10(-5) M quercetin. Furthermore, CD34 progenitors, positively selected, appeared fully resistant to quercetin concentrations as high as 2 x 10(-5) M. Thus, CD34+ progenitors are a quercetin-resistant component in normal bone marrow. In conclusion, our results further provide a biological basis for the therapeutic use of quercetin, considering that this compound could inhibit leukaemic cell growth without suppressing normal haematopoiesis.\n",
      "Patients with haematological disorders and their families must adjust to a wide range of psychosocial stresses, including coming to terms with a life-threatening diagnosis and coping with aggressive and invasive treatment regimens. The stress of this situation is exacerbated for many patients who must relocate to a metropolitan area for specialist treatment. This discussion presents research findings that indicate that for many of these patients the need for accommodation during relocation for treatment is a problem that should be given serious consideration. It is anticipated that this descriptive profile of a successful response to the problem of accommodation for leukaemia patients will provide useful data for the development of such services elsewhere.\n",
      "Recurrence of the original disease remains the main cause of treatment failure in patients given allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for either acute or chronic leukaemia. Infusion of donor lymphocytes (DLI) is useful for rescuing patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, while this option is of limited value in patients with acute leukaemia. Moreover, DLI may cause fatal graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or prolonged myelosuppression. A more sophisticated approach is that of generating and expanding ex vivo T-cell lines or clones able to selectively or preferentially lyse leukaemia blasts, while sparing non neoplastic targets. In this review, we will summarize the results we have obtained in vitro utilizing an approach based on the generation of leukaemia reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes through the use of apoptotic leukaemia cells as source of tumor antigens. Our approach proved to be feasible and effective in the experimental model for different types of leukaemia, even when the donor was HLA-disparate with the recipient. This strategy has to be tested in the clinical setting for proving its efficacy in preventing/treating leukaemia recurrence.\n",
      "Spatial variations in childhood acute leukaemia (AL) incidence rates were investigated by département, in mainland France, over the period 1990-2004. This is the first spatial study of this incidence to cover a 15-year period. French National Registry of Childhood Haematological Malignancies data and population counts by type of leukaemia (AL, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloblastic leukaemia), time period (1990-2004, 1990-1994, 1995-1999 and 2000-2004), sex, and age group (0-14, 0-4, 5-9 and 10-14 years of age) were considered. The overall homogeneity of the relative risks of leukaemia was tested, as well as comparison to 1 of each relative risk by the exact Poisson test. To give a more stable estimate of the underlying relative risk pattern than that provided by the local standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), Bayesian hierarchical models using four different spatial priors have been produced: the parametric BYM and CAR models, and two semiparametric models. Very slight overall heterogeneity was observed on the whole AL data set (SIR overdispersion 18.6%, P=0.10). Irrespective of the model, the ranges of the smoothed SIRs exhibited considerable shrinkage relative to the ranges of the local SIRs. The associated maps were slightly heterogeneous; the smoothed SIRs of overall acute lymphoblastic leukaemia of the south-west départements were slightly higher than those of the north-east. The results, however, did not remain stable when investigated by leukaemia type, time period, sex or age group. No spatial heterogeneity of childhood AL incidence on the département scale was observed but that does not exclude spatial heterogeneity on other scales.\n",
      "Response to treatment and resource implications were compared in two groups of children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treated during consecutive periods. Event-free survival at 5 years improved from 12% (SE 3.4) during 1972-82 (group A) to 45% (SE 6.9) during 1983-87 (group B). The median time spent in hospital increased from 35 to 170 d. Allogeneic marrow transplantation was offered to all eligible children in group B. Eleven of the 53 children had a suitable donor and 10 proceeded to bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The relapse rate was lower after BMT than after chemotherapy, although not significantly so. We conclude that there has been a real improvement in prognosis for children with AML; that modern treatment requires intensive hospital resources and that these results should encourage further efforts to improve outlook and to explore treatments not involving radiation.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to document the imaging abnormalities seen in the central nervous system (CNS) in cases of childhood leukaemia or as complications of its treatment. Magnetic Resonance (MR) images and Computed Tomographic (CT) scans were reviewed retrospectively in 22 children and adolescents with neurological manifestations/complications of leukaemia or its treatment. Among the 22 patients, nine had two or more different CNS abnormalities. The imaging abnormalities seen in 15 patients before or during treatment included sinus thrombosis, cortical vein thrombosis, cerebral haemorrhage, meningeal leukaemia, infections, skull leukaemic infiltration and treatment-related neurotoxicity. After therapy, seven patients had CNS abnormalities, including secondary brain tumours, skull tumour, mineralising microangiopathy, leucoencephalopathy, transient white matter abnormalities, spinal intradural haematoma, chronic subdural haematoma, radiation necrosis, meningeal leukaemia and leukaemic infiltration at the vertebral body. CNS complications are related to the inherent risk of leukaemia itself, to the treatment method and to the duration of survival.\n",
      "The management of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in India remains a challenge. In a two-year prospective study at our centre there were 380 newly diagnosed AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukaemia, AML-M3) patients. The median age of newly diagnosed patients was 40 years (range: 1-79; 12.3% were ≤ 15 years, 16.3% were ≥ 60 years old) and there were 244 (64.2%) males. The median duration of symptoms prior to first presentation at our hospital was 4 weeks (range: 1-52). The median distance from home to hospital was 580 km (range: 6-3200 km). 109 (29%) opted for standard of care and were admitted for induction chemotherapy. Of the 271 that did not take treatment the major reason was lack of financial resources in 219 (81%). There were 27 (24.7%) inductions deaths and of these, 12 (44.5%) were due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli and 12 (44.5%) showed evidence of a fungal infection. The overall survival at 1 year was 70.4% ± 10.7%, 55.6% ± 6.8% and 42.4% ± 15.6% in patients aged ≤ 15 years, 15 - 60 years and ≥ 60 years, respectively. In conclusion, the biggest constraint is the cost of treatment and the absence of a health security net to treat all patients with this diagnosis.\n",
      "Survivors of child acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) have a higher than expected risk of developing secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The glycophorin A (GPA) mutation assay measures the frequency of variant NO and NN erythrocytes in MN heterozygotes. A raised variant frequency (Vf) has been shown in patients treated with chemotherapy known to be at risk of secondary leukaemia. ALL patients were investigated for increased Vf using the GPA assay. Vfs at diagnosis were not significantly different from controls (NO Vf P = 0.193; NN Vf P = 0.790). During treatment Vfs increased significantly (No Vf P = 0.001; NN Vf P = 0.001). NO Vf returned to control values (P = 0.169) within 5 years from diagnosis but NN Vf remained significantly raised (P = 0.014). Three study patients developed secondary AML. At diagnosis of AML all three had significantly increased Vf. The first had a significantly raised Vf at routine follow-up 19 years following diagnosis of ALL then developed AML 3.5 years later. The second had a significantly raised NN Vf at diagnosis of ALL indicating possibly prior exposure to a mutagen or defective DNA repair involving erythroid stem cells. We conclude that a raised Vf detected by the GPA assay can act as a marker for the development of secondary induced leukaemia and can be used to screen individuals at a known high risk of this complication.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia in Western countries. The diagnosis requires mature-appearing lymphocytes in the peripheral blood to >5 x 10(9)/L. The immunophenotype typically includes B cell antigens CD19, CD20 and CD23, low expression of surface immunoglobulin and CD5+, with other T cell antigens absent. Bone marrow biopsy, although not required for diagnosis, must show at least 30% lymphocytes. Cytogenetic abnormalities are frequent in patients with CLL, and may be associated with poor prognosis. Clinically, most patients are asymptomatic at presentation, with incidental lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly in the routine physical examination. Infections by opportunistic pathogens are the major cause of death. Aggressive transformation occurs in 10% of patients with CLL, most commonly prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) and Richter syndrome. PLL de novo must be differentiated from PLL of an aggressive transformation. The incidences of autoimmune diseases and solid or haemopoietic secondary malignancies are increased in patients with CLL. Clinical stage is the strongest prognostic factor in CLL. There is no indication for early intervention. The current recommendation to start treatment includes disease-related symptoms, massive and/or progressive hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, increasing bone marrow failure, autoimmune disease, and recurrent infections. Alkylating agents (e.g. chlorambucil) and nucleoside analogues (e.g. fludarabine) are the most active agents for CLL. Fludarabine induces higher response rates, but no improvement in overall survival has been observed. Fludarabine is the drug of choice for the majority of patients with CLL. Chlorambucil may be helpful for elderly patients with poor performance, and for patients who do not tolerate fludarabine. No drug combination is better than single agents. For patients refractory to initial treatment, referral to a clinical trial is the best choice. Other salvage therapy includes retreatment with the same initial agent (chlorambucil or fludarabine) if initial response was observed, or fludarabine for patients refractory to chlorambucil. Promising new approaches include cycle-active agents, nelarabine, biological therapy such as anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, bone marrow transplantation, including the use of submyeloablative preparative regimens ('minitransplant') to induce graft-versus-leukaemia effect, and gene therapy. Prophylactic antibacterials and intravenous immunoglobulin should not be used routinely during supportive care. Epoetin may be helpful for patients who have anaemia without obvious cause. Assessment of response to therapy in CLL has been updated by the National Cancer Institute Working Group, and these guidelines are used worldwide for clinical trials.\n",
      "34 out of 403 apparently unselected adult patients with acute leukaemia referred to a single department from 1970 through 1989 survived more than 3 years. The cumulative rate of relapse after 3 years was 39% in patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and 74% in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The latest relapse was observed 75 months after diagnosis in AML and 98 months after diagnosis in ALL. 65% of the long-term survivors were able to undertake normal physical activity, 26% had decreased activity, and 9% were unable to work. 5-year survival for all patients, whether treated or not, during two successive decades was 16% versus 18% and 5% versus 6%, respectively, for ALL and AML. The departmental results were identical with population-based national results. Only in patients 15-49 years of age with AML was there evidence that more intensive treatment had led to better survival.\n",
      "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Firstly, to examine relationships between the birth and death addresses of children dying from leukaemia and cancer in Great Britain, and the sites of potential environmental hazards; and secondly to measure relative case densities close to, and at increasing distances from, different hazard types. DESIGN: Home address postcodes (PCs) and their map coordinates were identified at birth and at death in children who died from leukaemia or cancer. Potentially hazardous industrial addresses and PCs were listed from business and other directories, and map coordinates obtained from the Central Postcode Directory or else located directly on Ordnance Survey (OS) maps. Railway lines and motorways were digitised from OS maps. Numbers of deaths (and births) at successive radial distances from these hazards were counted and compared with expected numbers. The latter were based on a count of all PCs at similar distances. Relative case density ratios at successive distances from the hazards were obtained from observed and expected numbers, aggregated over similar sites. This was repeated for different hazard types and results were tested for evidence of systematic centrifugal case density gradients. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: All 22,458 children dying from leukaemia or cancer aged 0-15 years, in England, Wales, and Scotland, between 1953 and 1980. MAIN RESULTS: Relative excesses of leukaemias and of solid cancers were found near the following: (1) oil refineries, major oil storage installations, railside oil distribution terminals and factories making bitumen products; (2) motor car factories, coach builders, and car body repairers; (3) major users of petroleum products including manufacturers of solvents, paint sprayers, fibreglass fabricators, paint and varnish makers, plastics and detergent manufacturers, and galvanisers; (4) users of kilns and furnaces including steelworks, power stations, galvanisers, cement makers, brickworks, crematoria and aluminium, zinc, and iron/steel foundries; (5) airfields, railways, motorways and harbours. The findings for leukaemias and for solid cancers were indistinguishable. The hazard proximities of birth addresses were stronger than for death addresses. For children who had moved house between birth and death, the proximity effect was limited to the birth addresses. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancers are geographically associated with two main types of industrial atmospheric effluent namely: (1) petroleum derived volatiles and (2) kiln and furnace smoke and gases, and effluents from internal combustion engines.\n",
      "Deletions and apparent transcriptional abnormalities of the FHIT gene at 3p14.2 have recently been reported in a wide variety of solid tumours. To determine whether lesions of this gene also occur in leukaemia, we have analysed a total of 97 patients (chronic myeloid leukaemia, CML, in chronic phase or blast crisis, n = 71; de novo acute leukaemia, n = 26) and 16 normal individuals. Intact FHIT transcripts from all cases were amplified using RT-PCR. In addition, smaller size bands that were less intense than the full-length products were amplified from several samples from patients with leukaemia and also from normal leucocytes. Sequencing of the small products revealed that they were derived from FHIT transcripts lacking whole exons. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, no mutations in the coding sequence were detected in any patient. Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity was not seen in any of 36 informative patients at D3S1300 or D3S1481, markers located within the FHIT locus. We conclude that the FHIT gene and other uncharacterized tumour-suppressor genes at 3p14.2 are unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of acute leukaemia or progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis. Moreover, low-abundance FHIT transcripts that lack whole exons are not specific to malignant cells and should not be taken as evidence of an abnormality in the absence of demonstrable genomic DNA lesions.\n",
      "2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA) is an antileukaemic agent used in treatment of hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia of B- and T-cell type (B-CLL and T-CLL). The aim of this study was to elucidate the interpatient variability of CdA phosphorylation and its relation to response to CdA treatment. In extracts of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with B-CLL (n = 39), CdA phosphorylation was significantly higher than in HCL (n = 19) when calculated per protein (391 +/- 155 pmol CdA phosphorylated/mg protein/min versus 288 +/- 166 pmol/mg/min, P < 0.001), but was the same when calculated per cell (12 +/- 5.9 pmol/10(6) cells/min versus 14 +/- 5.9 pmol/10(6) cells/min) due to a larger cell volume in HCL. In T-CLL (n = 6), CdA phosphorylation was significantly lower than in B-CLL, both when calculated per protein (128 +/- 68 pmol/mg/min, P < 0.001) or per cell (5.7 +/- 2.7 pmol/10(6) cells/min, P < 0.05). This low CdA phosphorylation in T-CLL was unexpected because normal B- and T-lymphocytes contain equal amounts of CdA phosphorylation. With B-CLL, 21 patients who responded (complete and partial response) to CdA treatment showed a significantly higher CdA phosphorylation than 13 patients not responding to CdA treatment (456 +/- 170 pmol/mg/min versus 309 +/- 97 pmol/mg/min, P < 0.01). We conclude that the level of CdA phosphorylation is correlated with the response of leukaemias to CdA treatment.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/AIM: Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88), which activates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, is important for the growth of lymphoma and leukaemia cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of ST2825, a synthetic peptidomimetic compound which inhibits MYD88 homodimerization, on their growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven lymphoma and leukaemia cell lines including TMD8, a B-cell lymphoma line with MYD88-activating mutation, were treated with ST2825 and analysed for cell proliferation and expression of NF-κB signalling-related molecules. RESULTS: ST2825 suppressed the growth of all cell lines by inducing apoptosis and down-regulating phosphorylation of NF-κB pathway components inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase (IκB) and reticuloendotheliosis oncogene A (RelA), as well as of MYD88 activator Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), suggesting that MYD88 may affect BTK activity. ST2825 effects were specific as MYD88-targeting siRNA also suppressed phosphorylation of NF-κB signalling proteins and BTK in TMD8 cells. CONCLUSION: ST2825 may be a novel drug targeting not only B-lymphoid malignancies with MYD88 mutations, but also lymphoma and leukaemia with wild-type MYD88.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a malignancy of CD5(+) B cells. This B-cell lineage is established during ontogeny and replenished by the process of self-renewal. Spontaneous and induced leukaemias that frequently affect this lineage are thought to arise as a result of the frequent cell division required to maintain the population throughout adulthood and in response to repeated exposure to environmental antigens. In a series of bone marrow transplant (BMT) experiments performed in B6D2F1 mice, B-cell leukaemia occurred in recipients of serially transplanted syngeneic bone marrow. This study was therefore designed to determine the frequency and phenotype of the observed leukaemia. Male donor cells were initially transplanted into lethally irradiated female hosts and secondary (2 degrees ) BMT was performed at 3 months. At 1, 2, 3 and 16 months following primary (1 degrees ) BMT, and when 2 degrees BMT recipients developed leukaemia, animals were sacrificed and their tissues extensively examined. These analyses confirmed a host-derived CD5(+) transplantable B-cell leukaemia that was initiated in 50% of 1 degrees BMT recipients. With serial passage, the leukaemia became more aggressive and lost CD5 expression, suggesting transformation to a high-grade leukaemia/lymphoma. This previously unreported observation suggests that the combination of radiation and subsequent serial transplantation induces a proliferative stress to the host B-cell compartment that is causative in leukaemic transformation.\n",
      "To clarify the aspects affected by the PEBP2beta/MYH11 fusion gene involved in the inv(16), we analysed immunophenotypes in myelomonoblastic leukaemias. We found high expressions of CD34 and c-KIT antigens in myelomonoblastic cells from all patients carrying this fusion gene, including two with M4 and one CML blastic phase, in contrast to those with M4 without the fusion gene. These findings indicate that immunophenotyping is useful for detecting a leukaemia with the fusion gene in myelomonoblastic leukaemias and that the PEBP2beta/MYH11 gene is involved in immature cells expressing CD34 and c-KIT antigens.\n",
      "Since malignant cells are derived from normal cells, many tumour-associated antigens are also expressed in normal tissues. For examples, WT1 is expressed at elevated levels in most leukaemias, but it is also expressed at reduced levels in normal CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells and in progenitor cells of other tissues. Antigen expression in normal tissues is likely to trigger immunological tolerance and thus blunt T cell responses. This could explain the observation that WT1 vaccination in mice frequently fails to stimulate high avidity cytotoxic T cell responses. In order to circumvent tolerance, we have isolated from HLA-A2-negative donors high avidity CTL specific for HLA-A2-presented peptide epitopes of WT1. These allorestricted CTL efficiently kill HLA-A2-positive leukaemia cells but not normal CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells. However, adoptive cellular therapy with allorestricted CTL could only be performed in leukaemia patients rendered tolerant to the infused CTL by prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In order to circumvent this limitation, we propose to exploit the TCR of allorestricted CTL as therapeutic tool. TCR gene transfer can be used to take advantage of the specificity of allorestricted CTL and transfer it to patient CTL, while avoiding the transfer of immunogenic alloantigens from the donor CTL to the patient.\n",
      "We report 27 patients with relapsed acute or chronic leukemia who underwent a second hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from a related or unrelated donor. Seventeen patients were diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and four with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Ages ranged from 22 to 49 years (median 37); 13 patients were female and 14 male. Relapse was diagnosed between 1 and 45 months after the first HSCT. Sixteen patients who relapsed had received an autologous transplant initially and 11 an allogeneic transplant. Ten patients relapsed within 6 months and 17 patients later than 6 months. Chemotherapy was used as reinduction for relapse after HSCT in 16 patients who had received an autologous transplant and in three who had received an allogeneic transplant, since the latter did not respond to reduction of immunosuppression to induce a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reaction. Five of these 19 patients (26%) achieved complete remission (CR), seven patients did not respond to chemotherapy and seven achieved a partial remission (PR). The stem cell source for the second HSCT included bone marrow (n = 12) and PBSC (n = 4) from genotypically identical unrelated donors, PBSC (n = 7) and bone marrow (n = 3) from related donors. Currently eight of the 27 patients are alive and disease-free after the second HSCT. One patient is alive and disease-free after two allogeneic transplants (day +1538), eight patients, who relapsed after an autologous transplant followed by an allogeneic transplant (days +248 to +1140), acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 6) and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 2) are alive and disease-free. The overall disease-free survival is 30% (8/27). The overall disease-free survival of autologous transplant patients subsequently undergoing an allogeneic transplant is 43% (P = 0.049). It is suggested that a second HSCT is possible for patients with leukemia relapse following the first autologous transplant. A second transplant might also be offered to patients relapsing after the first allogeneic HSCT. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2000) 25, 41-45.\n",
      "The success of genetically engineered T cells that express chimeric antigen receptors (CARTs) has been a momentous step forward in harnessing the potent cancer fighting abilities of the immune system. The efficacy seen in relapsed/refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), not only by inducing remission, but also in maintaining long-term disease control, has been unprecedented. While the foundation for this approach has been firmly set in place, continued development will improve the efficacy, toxicity and applicability to other malignancies of this new class of 'living drugs'. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the most current clinical trial data in both acute and chronic leukaemias, and discuss some of the potential ways to enhance the activity and safety of CART therapy going forward.\n",
      "This EBMT activity report documents the haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) activity in Europe in 2005. It provides numbers of HSCT by indication, donor type and stem cell source, lists the new practice of planned double transplants with allogeneic after autologous HSCT and concentrates on the increasing role of unrelated transplants over the last years. In 2005, there were 24,168 first HSCT, 8890 allogeneic (37%), 15,278 autologous (63%) and 3773 additional re- or multiple transplants reported from 597 centres in 43 participating countries. Main indications were leukaemias (7404 (31%; 82% allogeneic)); lymphomas (13,825 (57%; 89% autologous)); solid tumours (1655 (7%; 92% autologous)) and non-malignant disorders (1131 (5%; 93% allogeneic)). A total of 671 planned allogeneic after autologous HSCT were reported; the majority for myeloma (52%), lymphoma (28%) and acute myeloid leukaemia (11%). Compared to 2004, there was a 20% increase in allogeneic HSCT; numbers of autologous HSCT remained constant. The most noticeable increase was in unrelated HSCT, which comprise 41% of all allogeneic HSCT. Unrelated HSCT were preferentially performed for leukaemias and in countries with high income according to World Bank criteria. These data illustrate the current experience in Europe and form the basis for patient counselling and decisions making at health care institutions.\n",
      "In 2014, strides were made in the care of haematological malignancies. In particular, the heterogeneity of multiple myeloma was unravelled, and new diagnostic criteria and frontline standards of care were proposed; new therapeutic approaches have been validated and approved in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; and in chronic myeloid leukaemia, complete cytogenetic response was confirmed as the primary therapeutic end point.\n",
      "The relative incidence of leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and central nervous system (CNS) tumours among workers presumably exposed to extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MFs) was studied. The study population consisted of all male industrial workers in Finland aged 25 to 64 years during 1971-1980 according to the Population Census in 1970. The occupations were grouped into three exposure categories according to the probability of exposure. The category of \"probable\" exposure included electrical occupations and the category of \"possible\" exposure included occupations where electric motors or welding are common. All other occupations were included to the category of \"no exposure\". Cancer incidence rates in different occupational groups during 1971-1980 were obtained after linking the census records with the national death certificates and the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry. The adjusted relative risks (with 95% confidence limits) in the categories of \"probable\" and \"possible\" exposure were for all leukaemia 1.9 (1.0-3.5) and 1.4 (1.1-1.8), for AML 1.5 (0.5-4.7) and 1.4 (0.9-2.1), and for CNS tumours 1.3 (0.7-2.3) and 1.3 (1.0-1.6), respectively. The results are concordant with earlier studies suggesting elevated risk among workers exposed to ELF magnetic fields.\n",
      "Adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is uncommon, with an age-standardised incidence of approximately 3 per 100,000. Patients present (median age, > 60 years) with evidence of bone marrow failure, anaemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia and their sequelae, or AML is detected incidentally by a full blood count. Treatment for AML aims to eliminate leukaemia from bone marrow with intensive chemotherapy: age (over or under 60 years) and performance status determines whether standard or high-dose chemotherapy can be used, but fewer than half the patients with AML are under 60 years. Supportive therapy during initial induction chemotherapy is needed to control neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding, and to ameliorate the side effects of chemotherapy. Standard induction chemotherapy produces complete remission in 56%-74% of patients; 20% are long term survivors; 10%-15% of patients die in the induction period. Allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended in patients under 50 years with an HLA- compatible sibling, with the best outcomes achieved in patients transplanted in first complete remission. It can also provide long term survival in patients who fail to achieve remission after induction therapy. The outcome of AML has improved, particularly for younger patients, but treatment outcomes for older patients and those with secondary leukaemia are still unsatisfactory. The mean overall survival of patients in randomised studies treated with standard therapy is still only 9-15 months.\n",
      "Traditionally, patients with acute leukaemia are admitted to hospital during chemotherapy-induced pancytopenia, although a few recent reports have reported the feasibility and safety of outpatient treatment. We have developed an outpatient treatment programme for patients with acute leukaemia incorporating comprehensive patient education for self-care management at home during pancytopenia and involvement of patients in care of their tunnelled central venous catheter (CVC). During neutropenia, patients are treated with prophylactic ciprofloxacine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and fluconazole. Herein, we report the results of outpatient treatment of 60 patients with acute leukaemia (54 with acute myeloid leukaemia) followed prospectively in the period from March 2004 to 2007. After induction chemotherapy, outpatient treatment was possible after 48 of 73 induction courses, with no readmission in 19 of these (40%). A total of 129 consolidation courses were administered with outpatient treatment following 116 of these, with no readmission in 69 (59%). The median number of days spent at home with neutrophils below 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 8 d per course following induction and 12 d following consolidation chemotherapy. The predominant cause of readmission was neutropenic fever, in most instances of unknown origin. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus faecium were the most frequently identified bacteria in blood cultures, whereas only four positive blood cultures with multiresistant Escherichia coli were identified in the entire patient cohort, the latter exclusively observed in patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. The majority of the patients were able to take care of their CVC including change in dressing and heparin flushing. There were 12 CVC-related infections. There were no treatment-related deaths. We conclude that outpatient treatment of patients with acute leukaemia is feasible and safe.\n",
      "AIM: To analyse haemopoietic regrowth and residual disease in bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens after treatment for acute leukaemia, using immunohistochemical staining. METHODS: Biopsy specimens before and after treatment were studied from patients diagnosed as having acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukaemia. Specimens after treatment encompassed periods from two to 56 weeks from the start of treatment. Routine haematoxylin and eosin and Giemsa stained sections were evaluated in association with immunostained preparations. A panel of antibodies was used, which reacts with epitopes showing restricted expression dependent on the lineage or maturation stage of cells. Results were evaluated in the light of clinical, peripheral blood, and marrow aspirate findings. RESULTS: The speed and sequence of regrowth of haemopoietic cells were more variable than expected. Immunostaining highlighted features of dysplasia after treatment and in some cases assisted detection of residual or relapsed leukaemia. Peripheral blood and aspirate cell counts reflected accurately the amount of regrowth, but not the dysplasia, seen in biopsy samples. Delayed regrowth was associated with complex individual factors. CONCLUSIONS: Morphological and immunohistochemical study of trephine biopsy specimens from patients treated for acute leukaemia provides information complementary to that obtained from peripheral blood and aspirated marrow. Variation in the timing and sequence of regrowth is highlighted. Immunostaining can aid in the detection of relapse or minimal residual leukaemia. The clinical relevance of dysplastic changes in biopsy specimens after treatment is uncertain, but such changes may persist for long periods.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarise diagnostic clinical/laboratory findings and highlight differences between classical hairy cell leukaemia (HCLc) and hairy cell leukaemia variant (HCLv). Discussion of prognosis and current treatment indications including novel therapies, linked to understanding of the underlying molecular pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Improved understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of HCLc, particularly the causative mutation BRAF V600E, leading to constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK signalling pathway and increased cell proliferation. HCLc is caused by BRAF V600E mutation in most cases. Purine nucleoside analogue (PNA) therapy is the mainstay of treatment, with the addition of rituximab, improving response and minimal residual disease (MRD) clearance. Despite excellent responses to PNAs, many patients will eventually relapse, requiring further therapy. Rarely, patients are refractory to PNA therapy. In relapsed/refractory patients, novel targeted therapies include BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), anti-CD22 immunoconjugate moxetumomab and Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi). HCLv has a worse prognosis with median overall survival (OS), only 7-9 years, despite the combination of PNA/rituximab improving front-line response. Moxetumomab or ibrutinib may be a viable treatment but lacks substantial evidence.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: To further define the relative impact of immunotherapy and subsequent development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) on survival in patients with relapsed acute leukaemia postallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT), we performed a single-centre retrospective analysis of 32 actively treated patients between 2003 and 2011. METHODS: A total of 13 patients were identified who were treated actively with cessation of immunosuppression ± Fludarabine, Cytarabine, G-CSF (FLAG) induction, but no donor leucocyte infusion (DLI) (non-DLI group) and 19 patients received the same step-wise therapy plus G-CSF mobilized DLI (G-DLI group). RESULTS: Groups were not statistically different with regards to baseline characteristics; however, the G-DLI group contained more sibling donors as opposed to unrelated donors than the non-DLI group. With a median follow-up of 47 months, the median overall survival (OS) of the non-DLI and G-DLI groups was not statistically different (8 months vs. 9 months, respectively, P = 0.5). Survival at 3 years was <10% in both groups. Univariate analysis identified response to FLAG, and new onset chronic GVHD as the only factors associated with improved OS. CONCLUSION: Second donor stem cell infusions are unwarranted in the treatment of relapse after allogeneic SCT and therapeutic strategies should focus on cytoreduction followed by immune modulation with the aim of invoking chronic GVHD.\n",
      "AIM: Previous surveys of ocular disease in leukaemia patients have shown the retina, choroid, and orbit as the most commonly involved sites. Depending on the type of leukaemia and the study design, the prevalence of ocular disease in leukaemia varies from 30 to 90%. Although chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia in Western countries, the prevalence of ocular disease in CLL is not known. The aim of this prospective study was to estimate the prevalence of ocular disease in CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All CLL patients attending either a teaching or district general hospital haematology clinic were invited to undergo a full eye examination. The clinical stage of the CLL (Binet) at the time of the eye examination and the most recent full blood count (FBC) indices were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: Over 6 months, 25 patients with an average age of 65 were recruited. A total of 18 patients had Binet stage A disease, three had stage B, and four stage C. The mean FBC indices at the time of examination were haemoglobin 13.5 g/dl, white cell count 37.4 x 10(9)/l, and platelets 172 x 10(9)/l. Only three patients (12%) had ocular disease that was likely to be a secondary complication of CLL. These secondary complications included bilateral posterior subcapsular cataract following radiotherapy, unilateral acute retinal necrosis, and unilateral conjunctival vascular anomalies. The presence of ocular complications was not related to the CLL stage or to the current FBC parameters. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that ocular involvement in CLL is uncommon, a reflection of the indolent course of CLL as compared to other leukaemias. Although sight-threatening ocular complications have been documented in this and other studies, the low prevalence of complications and the lack of association with disease parameters make it impossible to identify a 'high-risk' group. Routine screening of CLL patients for ocular complications is not justified.\n",
      "The aggressive radiotherapy and chemotherapy used in conditioning regimens for children with leukaemia undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) cause a severe catabolic state. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is indispensable in the management of these patients. 25 children with leukaemia undergoing BMT were studied to evaluate the efficacy of TPN and the value of anthropometric parameters and biochemical variables (albumin, retinol-binding protein and prealbumin) in monitoring nutritional status in the critical post-BMT phase. The complications of TPN were mainly metabolic, generally mild and easily controlled. The hyperalimentation solution and infusion line were not responsible for infection in any patient. The marked variations in anthropometric parameters and albumin expected in such patients were not observed in our children due to the nutritional support given. Prealbumin and retinol-binding protein showed statistically significant, positive variations (P less than 0.01), thus proving sensitive indices of the response to nutritional repletion.\n",
      "So where are we now? I think the first thing to say is that there is a well-established excess around Sellafield of childhood leukaemia, although excesses around other nuclear sites are of a lower magnitude. The excess near Sellafield is strongly associated with fathers having high exposure to external whole-body penetrating radiation while working at the installation before their child conception. But is this association pointing towards a causal mechanism? One possibility is genetic damage, but most geneticists and radiobiologists would consider that the levels of occupational exposure, even at Sellafield, are too low for this to be a plausible pathway on current knowledge. This is based to some extent on the lack of any similar effect among children born subsequently to Japanese survivors of the atomic bombs--however, the scenario is somewhat different contrasting a high short-term exposure with a lower long-term exposure. As well, some workers at Sellafield will also be exposed to radionuclides, such as plutonium, which we have not yet been able to analyse for. In addition, there are other exposures in a complex environment which may or may not be relevant. One experimental study in the laboratory using animals supports the idea that a pathway through irradiation of the parents is plausible, although this one result needs replication. Other causes have been suggested for the excess childhood leukaemia levels in particular around nuclear establishments--these include population movement, implicating viruses that have long been considered to be associated with childhood leukaemia, high rates in isolated communities, and also selection of areas for nuclear sites that have a natural propensity to high rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "There has been considerable progress in the understanding and treatment of childhood acute myeloid leukaemia over the past two decades. In particular, cyto- and molecular genetics offer the potential for more specific diagnosis of what is basically a heterogeneous disease. To date treatment has been based on a steady increase in cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without the addition of bone marrow transplantation. Randomised therapeutic trials are difficult to perform in what is a rare disease. The best way forward is for paediatric trial groups worldwide to collaborate in developing common, or parallel, therapeutic protocols.\n",
      "Children with Down syndrome (DS) are highly susceptible to acute leukaemia. Given the potential role of infections in the aetiology of leukaemia in children without DS, we investigated whether there was an association between early-life infections and acute leukaemia in children with DS. Maternal infections during pregnancy were also examined. We enrolled 158 incident cases of acute leukaemia in children with DS (97 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 61 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)) diagnosed at Children Oncology Group institutions between 1997 and 2002. DS controls (N=173) were selected from the cases' primary care clinics and frequency matched on age at leukaemia diagnosis. Data were collected on demographics, child medical history, mother medical history, and other factors by maternal interview. Analyses were conducted using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. A significant negative association was observed between acute leukaemia and any infection in the first 2 years of life (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.33-0.92); OR=0.53, 95% CI (0.29-0.97); and OR=0.59, 95% CI (0.28-1.25) for acute leukaemia combined, ALL, and AML respectively). The association between acute leukaemia and maternal infections during pregnancy was in the same direction but not significant. This study offers support for the hypothesis that early-life infections may play a protective role in the aetiology of acute leukaemia in children with DS.\n",
      "Using flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry, we investigated the reactivities of two different murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), MRK 16 and MRK 20, specific to adriamycin-resistant K562 cells (K562/ADM) with peripheral human mononuclear cells (MNC) (mainly blastic cells and lymphocytes) from 31 patients with leukaemia or malignant lymphoma. Reactivity with MRK 16 MAb was observed in five cases and reactivity with MRK 20 MAb in 18 cases. The cases were divided into three groups according to their reactivity patterns: group I, only the proportion of MRK 16-positive cells was increased; group II, only the proportion of MRK 20-positive cells was increased; group III, both MRK 16-and MRK 20-positive cells were increased. Some cases reflected the prior administration of adriamycin, vincristine, vinblastine and VP-16, which are known to induce P-glycoprotein expression. Expression of Mr 85,000 protein was observed more frequently than that of P-glycoprotein in leukaemia and malignant lymphoma, and this was not associated with either the total dose or period of administration of anticancer drugs. The expression of Mr 85,000 protein recognised by MRK 20 was further confirmed by Western blot analysis.\n",
      "A subset of patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) develop acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, little is known about the biology of such leukaemias and their relationship to the mast cell (MC) lineage. We report on two female patients who suffered from SM and AML. According to FAB criteria, the leukaemias were classified as AML-M4 (patient 1) and AML-MO (patient 2). The coexistence of the two distinct neoplasms (AML and SM) was demonstrable by immunostaining of serial bone marrow (BM) sections with monoclonal antibodies (mAb). In particular, the MC infiltrates were found to react with mAb against MC-tryptase and MC growth factor receptor c-kit (CD117), but not with mAb to CD15 or CD34. In contrast, the AML blasts were immunoreactive for CD15 (patient 1) or CD34 (patient 2), but did not express tryptase. The c-kit point mutation Asp-->Val at codon 816, considered to play a role in the transformation of MC progenitors, was detected in patient 1 in a BM cell fraction containing 4% MC. However, no c-kit mutation was found in pure AML blasts (<1% MC). These findings argue against an evolution of the AML clone from neoplastic MC or MC-committed progenitors.\n",
      "We report the case of a male patient with Ph-positive CML who developed AML 5 years after allogeneic BMT. Clinically, the AML seemed to develop on the basis of a myelodysplasia. The myeloid origin of blasts has been proven by immunophenotyping. The variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) and short tandem repeat (STR) showed donor-type haemopoiesis. The interphase FISH showed the XX genotype directly in the morphologically identifiable blasts and in the CD34-positive sorted bone marrow cells. This proved the new leukaemia to be of donor origin. The necessity of using multiple techniques and the advantage of combined immunophenotyping and FISH methods in this case is emphasized.\n",
      "Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of FAB classification for acute leukaemia was assessed using the modified criteria of the FAB classification. Leishman stained peripheral smear and May Grunwald Giemsa stained bone marrow smears from 72 cases of acute leukaemia were used for this purpose. Cytochemical stains used were peroxidase, PAS and Sudan black B. Intraobserver and interobserver concordance/discordance was calculated. Kappa statistic was used to correct the chance expected agreement. Intraobserver and interobserver concordance was 76% which improved to 91% when cytochemistry was included. Lymphocytic/Nonlymphocytic concordance was 87.5% and 90% respectively for intraobserver and interobserver groups.\n",
      "Fungal infections are increasingly being reported in patients with acute leukaemia on intensive induction chemotherapy protocols. The common fungi seen are candida, aspergillus and mucormycosis. We have seen 3 cases of mucormycosis over the last 4 years. All 3 patients had acute leukaemia-two had acute lymphoblastic and one acute myeloid leukaemia. All patients were in neutropenic phase after induction chemotherapy. Features suggestive of fungal infection were fever and development or progression of pulmonary infiltrates despite antibiotic therapy. Repeated body fluid cultures were negative in two patients. In the first patient, the diagnosis was confirmed after biopsy of a palatal mass; he was treated successfully with amphotericin-B. In two patients the diagnosis was confirmed at autopsy. A high degree of suspicion in febrile, neutropenic cancer patients on chemotherapy and early administration of amphotericin-B may improve the outcome. With dissemination, the prognosis is poor.\n",
      "Gene fusions are common driver events in leukaemias and solid tumours; here we present FusionAnalyser, a tool dedicated to the identification of driver fusion rearrangements in human cancer through the analysis of paired-end high-throughput transcriptome sequencing data. We initially tested FusionAnalyser by using a set of in silico randomly generated sequencing data from 20 known human translocations occurring in cancer and subsequently using transcriptome data from three chronic and three acute myeloid leukaemia samples. in all the cases our tool was invariably able to detect the presence of the correct driver fusion event(s) with high specificity. In one of the acute myeloid leukaemia samples, FusionAnalyser identified a novel, cryptic, in-frame ETS2-ERG fusion. A fully event-driven graphical interface and a flexible filtering system allow complex analyses to be run in the absence of any a priori programming or scripting knowledge. Therefore, we propose FusionAnalyser as an efficient and robust graphical tool for the identification of functional rearrangements in the context of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing data.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and aetiology of secondary leukaemia after childhood cancer in Britain. DESIGN: Cohort study and a case-control study. SETTING: Britain and population based National Register of Childhood Tumours. SUBJECTS: Cohort of 16,422 one year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed in Britain between 1962 and 1983, among whom 22 secondary leukaemias were observed. A case-control study of 26 secondary leukaemias observed among survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed in Britain between 1940 and 1983; 96 controls were selected matched for sex, type of first cancer, age at first cancer, and interval to diagnosis of secondary leukaemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dose of radiation averaged over patients' active bone marrow and total accumulated dose of epipodophyllotoxins, alkylating agents, vinca alkaloids, antimetabolites, and antibiotics (mg/m2) given for the original cancer. RESULTS: Cumulative risk of secondary leukaemia within the cohort did not exceed 0.5% over the initial five years beyond one year survival, except that after non-Hodgkin lymphomas 1.4% of patients developed secondary leukaemia. Corresponding figure for patients treated for non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the early 1980s was 4%. The relative risk of secondary leukaemia increased significantly with exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and dose of radiation averaged over patients' active bone marrow. Ten patients developed leukaemia after having an epipodophyllotoxin-teniposide in nine cases, etoposide in one. Chromosomal translocations involving 11q23 were observed relating to two secondary leukaemias from a total of six for which there were successful cytogenetic studies after administration of an epipodophyllotoxin. CONCLUSIONS: Epipodophyllotoxins acting alone or together with alkylating agents or radiation seem to be involved in secondary leukaemia after childhood cancer.\n",
      "Cells from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) were separated into CD34-enriched and CD34-depleted subpopulations. The clonogenic capacities of these two subpopulations were then compared to each other and to the original unseparated cell population. In every study, the CD34-enriched subpopulation demonstrated a substantial increase in clonogenicity in vitro in comparison with the original cell population, while the reverse was the case for the CD34-depleted subpopulations. For reasons not clear at present, the enrichment for clonogenic cells far exceeded the enrichment for cells expressing the CD34 antigen. Additionally, the clonogenic potential was found to be unrelated to the level of myc expression in the various cell populations.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and distribution of specific marrow patterns on pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations in children with leukaemia and lymphoma and with respect to the anatomic location. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant study included children with leukaemia or lymphoma who underwent pre-treatment MRI examinations over 18 years (between 1 January 1995 and 31 August 2013). Two radiologists blinded to the clinical diagnosis reviewed each study to determine the presence or absence of abnormal marrow signal and, when present, sub-categorised the pattern into diffuse, patchy, or focal abnormal marrow. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare marrow patterns between leukaemia and lymphoma. RESULTS: The study included 50 children (32 males and 18 females; mean age 9.5 ± 5.3 years) with 54 MRI examinations (27 leukaemia and 27 lymphoma) that included 26 spine and 28 non-spine studies. Marrow replacement was present on 43 (80%) studies, significantly more common with leukaemia than with lymphoma (p = 0.039). The diffuse replacement pattern was significantly more common with leukaemia when compared to lymphoma (p < 0.001) and the focal pattern was only observed with lymphoma. In the spine, the diffuse pattern was observed with lymphoma (3/14, 21%). All patients with leukaemia and MRI outside of the spine showed marrow involvement. CONCLUSION: Marrow replacement is common on MRI from children with leukaemia and lymphoma. A diffuse pattern was significantly associated with leukaemia on studies outside of the spine and a focal pattern was only observed with lymphoma, independently of the anatomic location. KEY POINTS: • Bone marrow replacement on pre-treatment MRI examinations in children with leukaemia and lymphoma was observed in 93% (25/27) and 67% (18/27), respectively. • Diffuse pattern of marrow replacement was significantly more common in leukaemia even though this pattern was also observed with lymphoma on the spine MRI studies. • Focal pattern of marrow replacement was present only with lymphoma and not with leukaemia regardless of the anatomic location.\n",
      "Twenty-seven patients above 40 years of age (range 40-55) with leukaemia underwent transplantation with haematopoietic stem cells from HLA-A, -B and -DR identical unrelated donors. They were compared to 69 younger patients, median age 23. In the older group, the diagnoses were acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) five, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) three and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) 19. The corresponding figures in the younger patients were 21, 27 and 21, respectively. Conditioning consisted of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) combined with 10 Gy total body irradiation. Immunosuppression was ATG or OKT3 for 5 days before transplantation and methotrexate combined with cyclosporin A. The probabilities of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 23 and 21%, and the cumulative incidences of chronic GVHD were 64 and 50% in the older and younger patient cohorts, respectively. Overall, 3-year transplant-related mortality rates were 46% in patients > or =40 years of age and 32% in patients <40 years of age (P = 0.16). Three-year patient survival rates were 54 and 46% in the two groups, respectively. In patients with chronic phase CML, the corresponding figures were 67 and 68%, respectively. We conclude that patients above 40 years of age should be considered for transplantation with marrow from unrelated donors.\n",
      "Isolated extramedullary relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with sparing of the marrow after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a rare occurrence, and the mechanisms underlying the selective involvement of extramedullary sites remain undefined. These might be due to relapse in sanctuary sites where the leukaemic cells are resistant to chemotherapy, or a stronger putative graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect in the marrow as compared with peripheral tissues. We report two ALL patients with repeated episodes of extramedullary relapse after BMT in whom both mechanisms might be operating. In the first patient, the marrow was in morphologic and molecular remission before isolated leukaemic relapse in the central nervous system (CNS) occurred. Subsequent secondary infiltration of leukaemic cells into the marrow was only evident molecularly but not morphologically, implying that the relapse had arisen in a sanctuary CNS site. In the second patient, a first relapse in the marrow, which was induced into morphologic and molecular remission by chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion, was followed by extramedullary relapses without any subsequent involvement of the marrow. This suggested that factors, likely to be due to a GVL effect, were stronger in the marrow than in peripheral tissues.\n",
      "The Bcl10 gene was identified through characterization of the t(1;14)(p22;q32) associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Bcl10 is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and has been reported to be mutated in other subtypes of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL) and leukaemic cell lines, raising the possibility that its deregulation could be implicated in other forms of haematological malignancy. We screened 226 cases, including 123 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 50 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 20 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), 10 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia-prolymphocytic leukaemia (CLL/PLL) and 23 cases with 1p abnormalities, for Bcl10 mutations by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformation polymorphism (RT-PCR/SSCP). Three known polymorphisms and two common splice variants were identified; however, no mutations were detected. One splice variant led to a 33-bp in frame deletion, whereas the other caused a 16-bp deletion predicting C-terminal truncation of Bcl10. However, both splice variants were also detected in normal bone marrow, suggesting that they are unlikely to be of pathogenetic significance. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis revealed no rearrangements of Bcl10 among 16 ALL and 11 cases of haematological malignancy with 1p abnormalities. Our results suggest that mutation of the Bcl10 gene as a mechanism of tumorigenesis is not associated with leukaemia.\n",
      "Two children with acute leukaemia developed histologically confirmed invasive aspergillosis within 2 weeks after onset of polychemotherapy. One child had received only prednisone and one pulse of vincristine and daunorubicin before. This child showed classical roentgenographic signs of aspergilloma following an upper pulmonary lobe infiltration. The second patient developed caecal aspergillosis obscured by clinical signs of appendicitis. He died of disseminated aspergillosis several weeks later in spite of systemic antifungal therapy. Both case reports illustrate that the possibility of invasive aspergillosis must also be expected in young patients soon after onset of induction chemotherapy.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 3q26 cytogenetic abnormalities is associated with overexpression of EVI1, dysmegakaryopoiesis and poor prognosis. Screening for EVI1 transcripts was performed in 336 cases of AML, including 139 patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Expression was detected in 7 out of 10 cases with and 23 out of 326 without 3q26 abnormalities including one APL case. Among cases lacking 3q abnormalities, detection of EVI1 transcripts was neither associated with characteristic dysmegakaryopoietic features, nor predictive of a poor outcome, indicating that screening will probably not assist in treatment stratification. This study nevertheless demonstrates that deregulation of EVI1, although rare in APL, is a relatively frequent event in AML.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether parental occupations and chemical and other specific exposures are risk factors for childhood leukaemia. DESIGN: Case-control study. Information on parents was obtained by home interview. SETTING: Three areas in north England: Copeland and South Lakeland (west Cumbria); Kingston upon Hull, Beverley, East Yorkshire, and Holderness (north Humberside), and Gateshead. SUBJECTS: 109 children aged 0-14 born and diagnosed as having leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma in study areas during 1974-88. Two controls matched for sex and date and district of birth were obtained for each child. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occupations of parents and specific exposure of parents before the children conception, during gestation, and after birth. Other adults living with the children were included in the postnatal analysis. RESULTS: Few risk factors were identified for mothers, although preconceptional association with the food industry was significantly increased in case mothers (odds ratio 2.56; 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 5.00). Significant associations were found between childhood leukaemia and reported preconceptional exposure of fathers to wood dust (2.73, 1.44 to 5.16), radiation (3.23, 1.36 to 7.72), and benzene (5.81, 1.67 to 26.44); ionising radiation alone gave an odds ratio of 2.35 (0.92 to 6.22). Raised odds ratios were found for paternal exposure during gestation, but no independent postnatal effect was evident. CONCLUSION: These results should be interpreted cautiously because of the small numbers, overlap with another study, and multiple exposure of some parents. It is important to distinguish periods of parental exposures; identified risk factors were almost exclusively restricted to the time before the child birth.\n",
      "The FMS proto-oncogene encodes a polypeptide growth factor receptor expressed on the cell surface of monocytes and B lymphocytes within the haematological system. Mutations of the FMS gene at codons 301 and 969 have been detected in a number of haematological disorders. Mutations at these codons are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of leukaemia in cells expressing a mutant receptor. Following our finding that the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) was expressed on B cells, we have assessed DNA from 17 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 15 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL), two samples from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), and 20 haematologically normal individuals for the presence of C-terminal mutations of the FMS gene. Using single stranded conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP), a single band shift was detected resulting from a nucleotide insertion at codon 965 in the DNA isolated from a patient with B-NHL. These results indicate that mutations of the FMS gene in this region are rare in B-cell malignancy but may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukaemias and lymphomas in a small subset of patients. However, the presence of other mutations not detected using this type of analysis cannot be excluded.\n",
      "Immunological phenotyping of acute leukaemias is important for a more precise diagnosis with respect to both cell lineage and maturation level. We have developed a rapid and reliable method for immunophenotyping, based on the use of magnetic monodisperse beads coated with monoclonal antibodies. After only a 10-min incubation of immunomagnetic beads (IMB) with mononuclear cells isolated from bone marrow or peripheral blood, the percentage of rosetting cells can be counted in the microscope. A panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies against haematopoietic cell-surface antigens was applied on 29 cases of acute myelogenic (AML) or lymphocytic (ALL) leukaemias, in order to compare immunological typing by immunomagnetic beads with immunofluorescence staining (IF). In all the cases tested, the two methods showed a virtually identical antigen distribution. The procedure described offers the advantages of being fast and simple to perform. Moreover, it has a high specificity and is easy to interpret in cases with low antigen expression.\n",
      "Acute leukaemia is a rare event during the course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and only a small fraction of such cases have been shown to be true acute lymphoblastic crises. 1 case is described where both small lymphocytes and proliferating lymphoblasts have the same monoclonal pattern as defined by direct immunofluorescence of membrane-bound immunoglobulins. Previous cases are reviewed and do not appear to be mere coincidence: acute blast crisis may represent a part of the natural history of CLL.\n",
      "Cell surface expression of CD86 (mCD86) provides an important co-stimulatory signal which profoundly influences immune responses. In this report, we investigated the potential presence of a circulating soluble form of CD86 (sCD86) in normal individuals and patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Circulating sCD86 was detected in the plasma of all normal individuals (1.04 +/- 0.33 ng/ml, n = 51) and patients analysed. Plasma collected from AML patients in remission (n = 6) contained only low levels of sCD86 but significantly elevated levels (> or =2.65 ng/ml, P < 0.0001) were detected in 10/24 AML patients analysed at the time of presentation or relapse. Significantly elevated levels of sCD86 were also detected in 2/17 B-CLL patients. There was no correlation between sCD86 levels and other clinical parameters. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that normal monocytes and dendritic cells, as well as isolated AML (n = 2) and B-CLL (n = 4) cells, expressed an alternatively spliced transcript of CD86 which encoded a soluble form absent in normal T, B and NK cells. The finding that a proportion of leukaemia patients contain elevated levels of sCD86 and that at least some leukaemic cells express sCD86 transcript suggests a potential role for sCD86 in modulating mCD86 signalling during the malignant process.\n",
      "During the last three decades it has become apparent that the majority of cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are characterized by at least one of a variety of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities. These changes have been found in many instances to correlate closely with distinct morphological features and clinical characteristics, the molecular basis of which is becoming increasingly understood. Furthermore, diagnostic karyotype has been shown to be a key determinant of outcome in AML, with mounting evidence to support the notion that cytogenetic analysis can serve to identify biologically distinct subsets of disease that demand tailored therapeutic approaches. This has led to a rising trend towards routine cytogenetic and molecular characterization of newly diagnosed acute leukaemia, providing a framework for treatment stratification.\n",
      "This study aimed to seek parents' experiences of how they learned their child had leukaemia and therefore identify ways of improving this process. To achieve this task a questionnaire was designed to ask parents about specific elements of the initial interview and give them opportunity to add their thoughts and feelings on the subject. All children with a diagnosis of leukaemia over an eighteen-year period were identified and parents of those children still alive were invited to partake in the study. 49 out of 50 families agreed to participate of which 35 (72%) returned completed questionnaires. The majority 29 (83%) expressed overall satisfaction. Their replies confirmed some findings of previous studies, and also offered some new insights. Examples of new findings or expansion on previous findings include observations on the presence of young children at the initial interview; the importance of the language used in conveying the diagnosis and prognostic information, and a preference for actuarial terms when discussing prognosis. Telling parents their child has leukaemia is a challenging and important task. The experience of parents gives us valuable insights into our own communication skills and highlights areas of possible improvement in this difficult area.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To analyse a decade-long pattern of clinical presentation of acute myeloid leukaemia patients and compare it with contemporary data. METHODS: The retrospective cohort study was conducted at the National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, and comprised of medical record of acute myeloid leukaemia patients from March 2006 to October 2016. Data noted age at presentation, gender, medical history, physical examination, blood and bone marrow investigations such as, haemoglobin levels, blood cell count myeloperoxidase activity, periodic acid-Schiff and reticulin staining as well as final diagnosis. Comparison, where possible, was done with contemporary literature. SPSS 19 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 626 subjects, 248(39.6%) were females and 378(60.4%) males. The overall mean age was 35.3±17.1 years. The most common age group was 15-40 years with 354(56.5%) patients. The most common subtype was acute myeloid leukaemia with maturation 183(33.6%). Myeloperoxidase activity was positive for the majority of the acute myeloid leukaemia patients. Periodic acid-Schiff test, done on only selected patients, was mostly negative. Reticulin staining was positive for 113(65.3%) patients. The most common presenting complaints were fever 266(71.9%) and weakness 168(45.4%). Mean haemoglobin and red blood cell count were 8.3 ± 2.4 g/dL and 2.9 ± 1.2 1012/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Acute myeloid leukaemia was found to be a highly variable disease that presented with non-specific signs and symptoms.\n",
      "AIM: This cross-sectional study evaluated periodontal status in patients with leukaemia and its correlation with haematological parameters. METHODS: Patients with different types of leukaemia and minimum age of 14 years were eligible. Calibrated examiners assessed Seymour index (SI), plaque index (PlI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) and performed an interview. Haematological parameters were obtained from haemogram performed on the same day of the periodontal examinations. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were evaluated, which corresponded to an 85% response rate. Periodontal parameters were in agreement with plaque accumulation (PlI 1.28 ± 0.5, GI 0.74 ± 0.4, PD 2.27 ± 0.6, BOP 33%, CAL 2.31 ± 1.6). PlI and CAL were statistically lower in acute leukaemia (1.13 ± 0.61 and 1.96 ± 1.7) in comparison with chronic leukaemia (1.46 ± 0.44 and 2.74 ± 1.4). Moreover, older age (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-1.56), higher educational level (CI: -1.94 to -0.64) and smoker (CI: 0.39-1.96) were associated with CAL. Correlation between periodontal and haematological parameters was not observed. Correlations between GI x SI and PD x SI were statistically significant (r(S) = 0.390, p = 0.001; r(S) = 0.517, p = 0.000 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Periodontal parameters were consistent with plaque accumulation and did not correlate with haematological parameters irrespective of the leukaemia type.\n",
      "Many different chromosomal translocations occur in man at chromosome 11q23 in acute leukaemias. Molecular analyses revealed that the MLL gene (also called ALL-1, HRX or HTRX) is broken by the translocations, causing fusion with genes from other chromosomes. The diversity of MLL fusion partners poses a dilemma about the function of the fusion proteins in tumour development. The consequence of MLL truncation and fusion has been analysed by joining exon 8 of Mll with the bacterial lacZ gene using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that this fusion is sufficient to cause embryonic stem cell-derived acute leukaemias in chimeric mice, and these tumours occur with long latency compared with those found in MLL-Af9 chimeric mice. These findings indicate that an MLL fusion protein can contribute to tumorigenesis, even if the fusion partner has no known pathogenic role. Thus, truncation and fusion of MLL can be sufficient for tumorigenesis, regardless of the fusion partner.\n",
      "Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorder with myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative overlap features, and an inherent tendency to transform to acute myeloid leukaemia. Approximately 30% of patients present with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, while almost 90% have molecular aberrations involving epigenetic regulation, the spliceosome component machinery, tumour suppressor genes and transcription factors/regulators. Numerous prognostic models exist for CMML, with more recent models incorporating prognostic mutations, such as those involving ASXL1. Other variables that seem to consistently affect outcomes include the degree of leucocytosis/monocytosis, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Allogeneic stem cell transplant remains the only curative option for CMML, while hypomethylating agents can be used for transplant-ineligible patients or those without suitable stem cell sources. Targeting biological pathways activated in CMML offers potential hope for more effective and less toxic therapies.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in first-line therapies, the outcomes of relapsed or refractory childhood acute leukaemia that has not achieved complete remission after relapse, has relapsed after stem cell transplantation (SCT), has primary induction failure and has relapsed with a very unfavourable cytogenetic risk profile, are dismal. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of T-cell-replete haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) with low-dose anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG), tacrolimus, methotrexate and prednisolone (PSL) in 14 paediatric patients with high-risk childhood acute leukaemia. RESULTS: All patients achieved complete engraftment. The median time to reaching an absolute neutrophil count of more than 0.5 × 10(9) L(-1) was 14 days. Acute graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD) of grades II-IV and III-IV developed in 10 (71%) and 2 (14%) patients, respectively. Treatment-related mortality and relapse occurred in one (7%) patient and six (43%) patients, respectively. Eleven patients were alive and seven of them were disease-free with a median follow-up of 36 months (range: 30-159 months). The probability of event-free survival after 2 years was 50%. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that T-cell-replete haplo-SCT, with low-dose ATG and PSL, provides sustained remission with an acceptable risk of GVHD in paediatric patients with advanced haematologic malignancies.\n",
      "Leukaemia cells possess a latent form of a cell surface protease referred to as guanidinobenzoatase. Latency is due to complex formation between an inhibitor protein and the cell surface enzyme which is stable under acid conditions but is dissociated with formaldehyde treatment. The latent form of the cell surface protease has been used as a protecting mechanism during a preliminary step to stain all the nuclei of cells with haematoxylin. The enzyme-inhibitor complex was then dissociated and a combination of 9-amino acridine and propidium iodide employed to enable the fluorescent location of cells possessing active guanidinobenzoatase. We were thus able to visualise the nuclei by conventional light microscopy and simultaneously visualise the cell surface of leukaemia cells by fluorescent microscopy. This simple model system has provided technology applicable to the more complex analysis of neoplastic cells in cervical smears.\n",
      "Because of developments in diagnosis of haemopoietic malignant diseases during the past two decades, routine and reliable identification of very low numbers of malignant cells, known as minimal residual disease (MRD), is now possible. Several large-scale studies have shown that monitoring of MRD in haemopoietic malignant disease predicts clinical outcome. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, MRD detection is useful for evaluating early response to treatment and consequently for improving stratification, including treatment reduction. In acute promyelocytic leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia, MRD information at specific time points enables effective early treatment intervention. MRD monitoring is also possible in other leukaemia subtypes, but in these disorders the clinical value of MRD detection is not yet known.\n",
      "Restriction fragment length polymorphisms can be used to distinguish blood and marrow cells from close relatives. We used two probes that recognize a series of dispersed and highly polymorphic tandem-repetitive minisatellite regions in the human genome that can be detected via a shared 10-15 base pair core sequence similar to the generalized recombination sequence (chi) of E. coli. We have studied the resulting individual-specific DNA fingerprints in 15 patients before and after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation performed for chronic myeloid leukaemia and in two patients transplanted for acute leukaemia. Early engraftment could be demonstrated at 3 weeks post-transplant based on the recognition of cells of donor origin. One patient who failed to engraft had only recipient type marrow cells 3 months post-transplant. Nine patients who relapsed after transplantation had only cells of recipient origin. In one patient who relapsed after transplantation with T-cell depleted donor marrow, fractionation studies showed that his T-cells at relapse were of recipient origin. We conclude that these minisatellite probes are valuable for characterizing the origin of different cell populations after marrow transplantation and could be useful for characterizing relapse when donor and recipient are of the same sex.\n",
      "The fusion oncogene, promyelocytic leukaemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor-α (RARA), initiates acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) through both a block to differentiation and increased self-renewal of leukaemic progenitor cells. The current standard of care is retinoic acid (RA) and chemotherapy, but arsenic trioxide also cures many patients with APL, and an RA plus arsenic trioxide combination cures most patients. This Review discusses the recent evidence that reveals surprising new insights into how RA and arsenic trioxide cure this leukaemia, by targeting PML-RARα for degradation. Drug-triggered oncoprotein degradation may be a strategy that is applicable to many cancers.\n",
      "When Joe Burchenal started studying medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1934, antibiotics had not been discovered and the survival of patients diagnosed with acute leukaemia was < 4 months. By the time he retired in 1983, 58% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia survived 5 years with the majority being cured of their disease. His early work in infectious diseases and antimicrobials equipped him well, both clinically and scientifically. The approach to developing antibiotics to conquer previously incurable infection was an inspiration and model for his pioneering work when searching for drugs with activity against cancer. Trials of sequential and then combination chemotherapy followed. Success in treating lymphoid malignancies in children led him to develop treatment regimens for other more resistant cancers, and as an advocate of collaborative working he introduced multimodal therapy to tackle bulky or metastatic cancers, replacing inevitable relapse with a chance of true cure.\n",
      "Therapy-related leukaemias are becoming an increasing healthcare problem as more patients survive their primary cancers. The nature of the causative agent has an important bearing upon the characteristics, biology, time to onset and prognosis of the resultant leukaemia. Agents targeting topoisomerase II induce acute leukaemias with balanced translocations that generally arise within 3 years, often involving the MLL, RUNX1 and RARA loci at 11q23, 21q22 and 17q21 respectively. Chromosomal breakpoints have been found to be preferential sites of topoisomerase II cleavage, which are believed to be repaired by the nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair pathway to generate chimaeric oncoproteins that underlie the resultant leukaemias. Therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemias occurring after exposure to antimetabolites and/or alkylating agents are biologically distinct with a longer latency period, being characterised by more complex karyotypes and loss of p53. Although treatment of therapy-related leukaemias represents a considerable challenge due to prior therapy and comorbidities, curative therapy is possible, particularly in those with favourable karyotypic features.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (M3) is associated with both a characteristic t(15;17) and severe bleeding diathesis caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and/or hyperfibrinolysis. It has been suggested that annexin II, a coreceptor for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen (PLG), is overexpressed on the surface of promyelocytes, leading to an increased fibrinolytic potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study examined the level of annexin II cell surface and mRNA expression in a range of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines. The evidence that annexin II levels are higher in APL would lend support to the hypothesis that the bleeding disorder seen in APL is caused by hyperfibrinolysis. RESULTS: Cell surface annexin II was found to be expressed at higher levels on NB4 (promyelocytic) cells than on either KG1a (early myeloid) or HL60 (myelocytic) cells. However, even higher levels were found on U937 and MM6 (histo-monocytic) and HEL (erythroid) cells (p<0.01). MM6 cells showed a threefold increase in annexin II mRNA compared to any of the other cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not fully support the concept of the coagulopathy associated with APL being caused by hyperfibrinolysis alone. Further investigations are required to identify the significance of annexin II expression and regulation in leukaemia.\n",
      "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains a curative treatment for haematological malignancies resistant to other treatment approaches through the unique graft-versus-leukaemia effect (GvL). However, the lack of specificity of this response results in the targeting of normal tissue, and the morbidity and mortality associated with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Further improvements in exploiting the GvL effect to prevent relapse in high-risk leukaemias while minimizing toxicity have focused on the use of targeted anti-leukaemic immunotherapy. These strategies include the use of vaccines against minor histocompatibility antigens (HA-1, HA-2 and H-Y) and leukaemia-specific antigens (proteinase 3, Wilms' tumour 1 and BCR-ABL), and the adoptive transfer of leukaemia-specific T cells. The unique post-transplant milieu, which is characterized by lymphopenia, regulatory T-cell depletion and the release of growth factors, offers the opportunity to promote the expansion of engrafted T cells and enhance the specific GvL response. Techniques to reduce regulatory T-cell control over T-cell responses to leukaemia antigens could further enhance GvL reactivity. Finally, these approaches to increase GvL effects would be facilitated by transplant approaches to deplete GvHD alloresponses selectively while preserving GvL reactivity.\n",
      "AIMS: Elimination of non-value added testing without compromising high-quality clinical care is an important mandate for laboratories in a value-based reimbursement system. The goal of this study was to determine the optimal combination of flow cytometric markers for a screening approach that balances efficiency and accuracy. METHODS: An audit over 9 months of flow cytometric testing was performed, including rereview of all dot plots from positive cases. RESULTS: Of the 807 cases in which leukaemia/lymphoma testing was performed, 23 were non-diagnostic and 189 represented bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Of the remaining 595 cases, 137 (23%) were positive for an abnormal haematolymphoid population. Review of the positive cases identified minimum requirements for a screening tube as well as analysis strategies to overcome the diagnostic pitfalls noted. It is estimated that 38% fewer antibodies would be used in a screening approach, representing an opportunity for significant cost savings. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a framework for developing an evidence-based screening combination for cost-effective characterisation of haematolymphoid malignancies, promoting adoption of 'just-in-time' testing systems that tailor the evaluation to the diagnostic need.\n",
      "We investigated the occurrence of late events (beyond 2 years) in patients with acute leukaemia who received an allogeneic (BMT) (n = 1059), or an autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) (n = 656) in Europe during the period from January 1979 to December 1990. Patients with no recurrence of leukaemia at 2 years had overall 82% chance of being alive in complete remission at 9 years following transplantation regardless of the nature of the leukaemia, the status at transplant, and the type of transplant. The incidence of late relapses continuously decreased with time. The latest relapses in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) were observed following BMT at 6.6 years in a patient transplanted in first remission (CR1) and at 3.7 years in a patient transplanted in second remission (CR2), and following ABMT at 6 years and 5.1 years respectively. The latest relapses in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were observed following BMT at 4 years in a patient transplanted in first remission (CR1) and at 6.8 years in a patient transplanted in second remission (CR2), and following ABMT at 5.3 years and 4.5 years respectively. Several factors predictive for late relapse or death were identified. Patients allografted experienced a lower frequency of late relapse than patients autografted. Of the numerous other prognostic factors studied, female sex in AML, the use of total body irradiation (TBI) in ALL and status in CR1, rather than CR2-3, for both ALL and AML allografted were correlated with a lower relapse incidence. The use of TBI in ALL was also associated with a better LFS and survival. The absence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allografted AML correlated with better LFS and better survival, but had no influence on the relapse incidence. This study indicates that patients alive and well at 2 years post transplant have a very high probability of being cured, but the possibility of late relapse still remains.\n",
      "Phytocannabinoids possess anticancer activity when used alone, and a number have also been shown to combine favourably with each other in vitro in leukaemia cells to generate improved activity. We have investigated the effect of pairing cannabinoids and assessed their anticancer activity in cell line models. Those most effective were then used with the common anti-leukaemia drugs cytarabine and vincristine, and the effects of this combination therapy on cell death studied in vitro. Results show a number of cannabinoids could be paired together to generate an effect superior to that achieved if the components were used individually. For example, in HL60 cells, the IC50 values at 48 h for cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) when used alone were 8 and 13 µM, respectively; however, if used together, it was 4 µM. Median-effect analysis confirmed the benefit of using cannabinoids in pairs, with calculated combination indices being <1 in a number of cases. The most efficacious cannabinoid-pairs subsequently synergised further when combined with the chemotherapy agents, and were also able to sensitise leukaemia cells to their cytotoxic effects. The sequence of administration of these drugs was important though; using cannabinoids after chemotherapy resulted in greater induction of apoptosis, whilst this was the opposite when the schedule of administration was reversed. Our results suggest that when certain cannabinoids are paired together, the resulting product can be combined synergistically with common anti-leukaemia drugs allowing the dose of the cytotoxic agents to be dramatically reduced yet still remain efficacious. Nevertheless, the sequence of drug administration is crucial to the success of these triple combinations and should be considered when planning such treatments.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is characterized by a block in differentiation and an unregulated proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells. While the cause of AML in children is unknown, risk factors that have been identified include exposure to toxins such as ethanol, pesticides and dietary topoisomerase II inhibitors, prior chemotherapy with alkylating agents or topoisomerase II inhibitors, constitutional disorders such as Down syndrome and type I neurofibromatosis, and haematopoietic failure syndromes such as Fanconi anaemia and severe congenital neutropenia. With intensified chemotherapy including high-dose Ara-C, followed in many cases by bone marrow transplantation, and with improvements in supportive care, current survival rates approach 50%. Future advances in paediatric AML will include better risk stratification to determine optimal treatment and targeted cytotoxic therapy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantation is an accepted treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). We have recently reported improving results in HLA-identical sibling transplant over the ten year period 1981-1990. In this report we described the outcome in patients transplanted at St Vincent Hospital, Sydney between 1989 and 1993. AIMS: To determine the leukaemia-free survival, transplant-related mortality rate, and relapse rate for patients with AML or CML given HLA-identical sibling marrow transplants between 1989 and 1993. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with AML or CML received high dose busulphan/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy followed by infusion of T replete, HLA-identical sibling bone marrow. Cyclosporin/short methotrexate was utilised as prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease, ganciclovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus disease and cotrimoxazole as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Low dose intravenous heparin was used as prophylaxis for hepatic veno-occlusive disease. RESULTS: The five year disease-free survival for patients with AML transplanted in first complete remission was 72% and for those with CML transplanted in first chronic phase was 77%. The relapse rate for AML transplanted in first complete remission was 15% and for CML in first chronic phase 0%. The transplant-related mortality for AML transplanted in first complete remission was 16% and for CML transplanted in first chronic phase 23%. In contrast, the disease-free survival, relapse rate and transplant-related mortality for patients with AML transplanted outside first complete remission and for CML transplanted beyond first chronic phase was 17%, 57% and 57% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome for patients transplanted for early AML or early CML continues to improve and exceeds that obtainable by conventional therapy. The salvage rate is so low for patients transplanted in later stages of AML or CML that all patients less than 55 years of age with these diseases, who have a HLA-identical sibling donor, should be offered bone marrow transplantation early in their disease course.\n",
      "Telomeres are DNA structures which serve to stabilize chromosomes. In human cells telomeres progressively shorten with each cell division leading to eventual chromosome instability and cell death. Telomerase is a DNA polymerase which is required for the maintenance of telomeres. Therefore, telomeres and telomerase play a role in the regulation of the life span of the cell. Human cells express low levels of telomerase, however when telomere length reaches a critical level abnormal activation of telomerase can lead to immortalization and uncontrolled proliferation. This process has been associated with the development of many leukaemias and lymphomas. Understanding these processes in normal and malignant cells could lead to therapies which target the telomere/telomerase complex.\n",
      "The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) is present in 95% of chronic myelogenous leukaemias (CML) and 15% of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL). This cytogenetic marker is due to a t(9;22) translocation, which causes a rearrangement of the ABL oncogene. In order to better define the relationship between type of genomic rearrangement, variant ABL protein expressed and haematological phenotype, a series of Ph1-positive acute leukaemias, both myeloblastic (AML) and lymphoblastic, and several CML lymphoid blast crises have been analysed at the DNA and protein level. The results confirm the presence of the ABL protein P210 in all cases of CML, ALL and AML positive for rearrangement in the bcr region of chromosome 22, and, surprisingly, in one AML case apparently negative for bcr rearrangement. The ABL protein P190 was found to be present only in cases of ALL negative for bcr rearrangement. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the types of 9/22 junctions present in the mRNA of CML lymphoid blast crises showed no evidence of 'ALL-type' transcripts.\n",
      "Leukaemia risk in adult populations exposed to environmental air pollution is poorly investigated. We have carried out a population-based case-control study in an area that included a fossil fuel power plant, a coke oven and two big chemical industries. Information on residential history and several risk factors for leukaemia was obtained from 164 cases, diagnosed between 2002 and 2005, and 279 controls. A higher risk for subjects residing in polluted areas was observed, but statistical significance was not reached (adjusted OR = 1.11 and 1.56 for subjects living in moderately and in heavily polluted zones, respectively, p = 0.190). Results suggest a possible aetiological role of residential air pollution from industrial sites on the risk of developing leukaemia in adult populations. However, the proportion of eligible subjects excluded from the study and the lack of any measure of air pollution prevent definitive conclusions from being drawn.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine if a relation exists between paternal exposure to relatively high levels of radiation in the Scottish nuclear industry and the risk of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma is subsequently conceived children. DESIGN: Matched case-control study with three controls for each case. SETTING: The whole of Scotland. SUBJECTS: The fathers of 1024 children with leukaemia and 237 children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in Scotland below the age of 25 among those born in Scotland since nuclear operations began (in 1958) and the fathers of 3783 randomly chosen controls. The fathers of 80 children with leukaemia and 16 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in north Cumbria were also covered since some workers at one Scottish nuclear site live over the border in that area. Details of all fathers were then matched against records of the nuclear industry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Paternal preconceptional radiation exposures, particularly relatively high levels, both lifetime and in the six and three months before conception. RESULTS: No significant excess was observed in any subgroup and there was no significant trend: fathers of three controls but no cases were exposed to lifetime preconceptional levels of 100 mSv or greater (Fisher exact p value 0.84). In the six months before conception, fathers of two cases and three controls received 10 mSv or more, odds ratio 2.3 (95% confidence interval 0.31 to 17.24). In the three months before conception the fathers of one case and two controls received 5 mSv or more, odds ratio 1.7 (0.10 to 30.76). The results for leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma combined were similar. CONCLUSIONS: No significant excess of leukaemia or of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was found at any radiation level in any preconceptional period.\n",
      "Anti-cancer drugs may be able to inhibit tumour growth and metastasis by blocking fibrinogen- and/or fibrin-related pathways. To test this hypothesis, the effect of various anti-neoplastic drugs on the binding of 125I-Fibrinogen to two leukaemia cell lines, HL60 and P388, was investigated. All the drugs tested inhibited the binding of fibrinogen to leukaemia cells. This effect was particularly marked for drugs that act as inhibitors of protein synthesis. Since these anti-neoplastic drugs do not have anti-coagulant actions, these results provide evidence for the potential of targeting tumour fibrinogen as a new form of cancer chemotherapy.\n",
      "In recent decades, the conduct of uniform prospective clinical trials has led to improved remission rates and survival for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, high-risk patients continue to have inferior outcomes, where chemoresistance and relapse are common due to the survival mechanisms utilised by leukaemic cells. One such mechanism is through hijacking of the bone marrow microenvironment, where healthy haematopoietic machinery is transformed or remodelled into a hiding ground or \"sanctuary\" where leukaemic cells can escape chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. The bone marrow microenvironment, which consists of endosteal and vascular niches, can support leukaemogenesis through intercellular \"crosstalk\" with niche cells, including mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. Here, we summarise the regulatory mechanisms associated with leukaemia-bone marrow niche interaction and provide a comprehensive review of the key therapeutics that target CXCL12/CXCR4, Notch, Wnt/b-catenin, and hypoxia-related signalling pathways within the leukaemic niches and agents involved in remodelling of niche bone and vasculature. From a therapeutic perspective, targeting these cellular interactions is an exciting novel strategy for enhancing treatment efficacy, and further clinical application has significant potential to improve the outcome of patients with leukaemia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the association between childhood infections and childhood leukaemia have produced inconsistent results, likely due to the recall error/bias of infection data reported by the parents. The current study used a population-based and record-based case-control design to evaluate the association between childhood leukaemia and infections using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. METHODS: In all, 846 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 193 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2008, aged >1 and <10 years, were included. Up to four controls (3374 for ALL and 766 for AML) individually matched to each case on sex, birth date and time of diagnosis (reference date for the controls) were identified. Conditional logistic regression was performed to assess the association between childhood leukaemia and infections. RESULTS: Having any infection before 1 year of age was associated with an increased risk for both childhood ALL (odds ratio = 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.2-4.7) and AML (odds ratio = 6.0, 95% confidence interval 2.0-17.8), with a stronger risk associated with more episodes of infections. Similar results were observed for infections occurring >1 year before the cases' diagnosis of childhood leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Children with leukaemia may have a dysregulated immune function present at an early age, resulting in more episodes of symptomatic infections compared with healthy controls. However, confounding by other infectious measures such as birth order and day care attendance could not be ruled out. Finally, the results are only relevant to the medically diagnosed infections.\n",
      "The thrombopoietin receptor gene (MPL) is expressed in megakaryocytes and exhibits the gain of function point mutation W515K/L in approximately 5% of patients with primary myelofibrosis/idiopathic myelofibrosis (PMF) representing one subtype of the chronic myeloproliferative disorders (myeloproliferative neoplasm). A series of primary and secondary acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) with megakaryoblastic phenotype and myelofibrosis unrelated to PMF (n=12) was analysed for the MPL(W515K/L) mutation by pyrosequencing. In three cases (25%), MPL(W515L) was found and in two of these a combination with trisomy 21 or the Philadelphia chromosome occurred. None of the secondary AML cases evolving from pre-existing PMF showed MPL(W515K/L) (n=4). We conclude that MPL(W515L) occurs in a considerable proportion of acute megakaryoblastic leukaemias with myelofibrosis unrelated to PMF.\n",
      "In vivo chemotaxis and phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were evaluated in 20 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and in 10 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). For comparison, 20 healthy individuals were investigated. A skin-chamber technique and a phagocytosis test were used to quantify the neutrophil functions. The local leucocyte mobilisation in the skin-chamber was significantly lower in untreated patients with AML and ALL than in healthy individuals (P < 0.05). Patients with acute leukaemia in remission showed an increase in chemotactic parameters though they remained below normal levels. The phagocytosis index (PI) of peripheral blood PMN was lower than 30% (normal individuals: 60%) in untreated AML and ALL; this difference was significant (P < 0.05). The PI of peripheral blood PMN in patients with acute leukaemia in remission returned to the normal level. Investigation of granulocytic function in patients with acute leukaemia in remission may reveal evidence for reduced protection by these cells against infections and lead to adequate therapy.\n",
      "Chronic lymphoid leukaemias are clonal expansions of B and T cells with mature membrane phenotype. Cytogenetic study of these cases usually requires mitogenic stimulation and can often be hindered by a lack of response of the tumour cells to mitogen, poor quality metaphases, complex markers and proliferation of normal cells. In situ hybridisation with fluorescence-labelled chromosome-specific centromeric DNA probe, single or low copy sequences and whole chromosome paints which hybridise to complementary sequences allow the detection of numerical and structural abnormalities on metaphase and interphase cells with much greater efficiency. Comparative genomic hybridisation uses whole genomic tumour DNA as probe which is hybridised to normal metaphases. It is particularly useful for detecting chromosomal changes without being dependent on the dividing tumour cells. The application of these techniques to the investigation of chronic lymphoid leukaemias is reviewed with emphasis on the work done in our laboratory on trisomy 12 and the tumour suppressor region 13q14 in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, translocation t(11;14) (q13;q32) in mantle cell lymphoma and other chronic B cell leukaemias, inv(14) (q11q32), i(8q) and complex markers in T prolymphocytic leukaemia.\n",
      "Timely diagnosis and care are major determinants of the outcome in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), a malignancy whose incidence may be increasing. The Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR) and health system represent valuable settings to study APL epidemiology. We analysed the CCR, which contains data on all Canadians with APL. To provide clinical information lacking in the CCR, we obtained data from five leukaemia referral centres during a similar time period. Between 1993 and 2007, there were 399 APL in Canada. Age-standardized incidence was 0·083/100,000 and was stable over time. The early death (ED) rate was 21·8% (10·6% in patients <50 years old and 35·5% for those aged >50 years), with no improvement over time. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 54·6% (73·3% in patients <50 years; 29·1% older patients). In the referral cohort, 131 patients were diagnosed between 1999 and 2010. ED was 14·6% and 2-year OS was 76·5%. Within this cohort, ED and OS improved over time, although advanced patient age remained an adverse determinant of OS. In Canada, APL incidence is unexpectedly low and temporally stable. ED was higher than reported in clinical trials, but similar to reports from other registries. In contrast, ED was lower in referral centres and improved with time.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate recent time trends of some selected and common neoplasms of the blood and lymphatic tissues. METHODS: A specialist population-based register of hematological and related neoplasms was set up in parts of the UK in 1984. Secular changes over the first 10 years were investigated using log-linear Poisson modeling. The results are presented in tabular and graphical form. RESULTS: The analyses of 26,899 cases revealed a decline in incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) including chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and, in males only, Hodgkin disease (HD). No secular trends for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were observed at any age. A marked increase in incidence in non-Hodgkin disease (NHL) and the pre-leukemia group of myeloid dysplasias (MDS) was found. CONCLUSIONS: The rise in MDS and decline in AML and related conditions are most likely to reflect diagnostic changes. Changes in NHL may reflect, in part, a similar phenomena, but an underlying upward trend cannot be excluded. The decline in HD is in one gender only and the significance of this remains to be investigated.\n",
      "Cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) is used to treat leukemias, with complete remission induced by combination chemotherapy in approximately 70% of cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Ara-CTP acts as a competitive inhibitor of DNA polymerase and may also be incorporated into DNA. Accumulation of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) induced by Ara-C may indicate disruption of DNA synthesis in susceptible leukemia cells. A procedure has been developed for the quantification of Ara-CTP and dNTPs from small samples of leukaemia cells from patients (4 x 10(7) cells) activated with concanavalin A (10 micrograms/ml, 48 hr) and grown in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate (1.1 microM, 9 x 10(6) Ci/mol, 16 hr). The susceptibilities to Ara-C of the human leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM (IC50 = 6.30 nM), CCRF-HSB-2 (IC50 = 10.4 nM) and MOLT-4 (IC50 = 10.0 nM) may be correlated with their abilities to accumulate high concentrations of Ara-CTP (> 1000 amol/cell) with increases of between 1.3- and 3.4-fold in dATP, dGTP and dTTP for the four cell lines, while dCTP decreased between 0.23- and 0.78-fold. By contrast, an Ara-C-resistant derivative of HL-60 cells (IC50 = 400 nM) accumulated only low concentrations of Ara-CTP (71 amol/cell) without significant changes in dNTPs. High concentrations of Ara-CTP in leukemia cells induce accumulations of dATP, dGTP and dTTP due to inhibition of DNA synthesis, and depletion of dCTP. This imbalance in the pools of the four dNTPs could lead to genetic miscoding and cell death.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: According to radiation risk estimates uniformly adopted by various official organizations, exposure to Chernobyl fallout is unlikely to have caused any measurable health risk in central Europe. METHODS: A re-evaluation of ECLIS (European Childhood Leukaemia and Lymphoma Incidence Study), a large IARC-coordinated project in the context of various published studies. RESULTS: ECLIS revealed a slightly higher leukaemia incidence in the most contaminated European regions, and an increasing trend with estimated cumulative excess radiation dose. The excess corresponds to 20 cases of childhood leukaemia in the study area up to 1991. More recent evidence from Greece and Germany indicates significantly higher risks in the cohort of children in utero at the time of the initial fallout. In Greece, a positive trend was observed over three regions of increasing average fallout contamination. CONCLUSION: Chernobyl fallout could well have caused a small, but significant excess of childhood leukaemia cases in Europe. The etiologic mechanism might include an induction of chromosome aberrations in early pregnancy. Increased risks in the birth cohort exposed in utero correspond to 11 excess cases in Greece and another 11.4 excess cases in Germany. Exposure misclassification and underascertainment of incident cases render post-Chernobyl risk estimates probably too low. If indeed Chernobyl fallout has caused childhood leukaemia cases in Europe, we would also expect an increased incidence for other childhood cancers and excess malignancies in adults as well as non-malignant diseases of all ages. Neither of these endpoints has as yet been systematically studied.\n",
      "This article describes an Australian initiative that has undertaken the challenge of establishing a permanent psychosocial research program on leukaemia and associated haematological disorders to inform service provision and policy development for patients and their families. The description of this initiative is set in the context of a summary of the present research that exists in this area. This research indicates that this is a group of patients with a high rate of morbidity who, along with their family and carers, are vulnerable to physical, social, emotional and spiritual distress. The discussion concludes with a description of research projects that are presently being undertaken to extend our understanding of the psychosocial issues associated with these diagnostic groups.\n",
      "Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is very effective for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) but little can pass through the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), which limits its use in the prevention and treatment of central nervous system leukaemia (CNSL). Before creating a non-invasive method to help As2O3  access, the safe and effective therapeutic concentration of As2O3 in the CNS ought to be known. The changes of apoptosis biomarkers, [Ca2+]i and PKC activity of both leukaemia cells and human cortical neurons, were monitored before and after being treated with As2O3 in vitro with laser confocal microscopy and Western blot. NSE concentration, the neuron invasive biomarker, was monitored by enzyme immunoassay (NSE-EIA). This study revealed that cortical neuron was more tolerable to As2O3 compared to NB4. 1.0 micromol / L As2O3 showed little influence on cortical neuron but effectively promoted apoptosis and induced differentiation of NB4.\n",
      "Although there have been many new developments in the treatment of leukaemia with the use of new anti-leukaemic agents and stem cell transplantation, drug resistance and treatment failure remain a great challenge for the attending physician. Several studies have suggested that leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) play a pivotal role in chemoresistance and metastasis and the mechanisms by which these cells do so have also been elucidated. There is increasing evidence to show that there exists a large pool of therapeutic targets in LSCs and that the eradication of these cells is feasible with some promising results. This article gives an overview of different types of cancer stem cells (CSCs) derived from various types of leukaemia, the mechanisms by which LSCs contribute to drug resistance and metastasis and some recent advances in targeted therapy against LSCs.\n",
      "We report a series of five Australian cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) occurring concurrently with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Patient management including therapies and response together with clinical progress was obtained from medical records and laboratory information systems. Prior to CML diagnosis, all five had a preceding diagnosis of CLL. Three had received prior fludarabine. All received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). None required subsequent therapy for CLL. One patient had 17p deletion CLL and another patient had normal CLL cytogenetics. All currently have satisfactory blood counts with quantitative polymerase chain reaction for CML showing molecular response. All remain alive. Thus, such cases can be successfully managed by treating each haematological disorder in the usual manner. The control achieved in CML with the TKI enables satisfactory marrow function to recover in patients with concomitant CLL. The role for allograft in patients with dual malignancies is uncertain and needs to be individualised depending on control of each malignancy.\n",
      "Previous studies on maternal nutrition and childhood leukaemia risk have focused on the role of specific nutrients such as folate and have not considered broader measures of diet quality, which may better capture intake of diverse nutrients known to impact fetal development. We examined the relationship between maternal diet quality before pregnancy, as summarised by a diet quality index, and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in a case-control study in California. Dietary intake in the year before pregnancy was assessed using FFQ in 681 ALL cases, 103 AML cases and 1076 matched controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate OR and 95 % CI for diet quality continuous score and quartiles (Q1-Q4). Higher maternal diet quality score was associated with reduced risk of ALL (OR 0·66; 95 % CI 0·47, 0·93 for Q4 v. Q1) and possibly AML (OR 0·42; 95 % CI 0·15, 1·15 for Q4 v. Q1). No single index component appeared to account for the association. The association of maternal diet quality with risk of ALL was stronger in children diagnosed under the age of 5 years and in children of women who did not report using vitamin supplements before pregnancy. These findings suggest that the joint effects of many dietary components may be important in influencing childhood leukaemia risk.\n",
      "We report a 16-year-old girl who was diagnosed with acute leukaemia and a marked leucocytosis >200 × 109/L. She presented with marked hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, acute renal failure and acute respiratory failure. These electrolytes disturbances may indicate rapid tumour genesis. These ominous findings required urgent treatment to halt the crises of rapid leukemic cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Mark hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia may be presenting electrolyte abnormalities in a patient with acute leukaemia, and these may be indicators of aggressive tumour genesis. What is known: • Mild electrolyte disturbances are common in oncology patients • Tumour lysis syndrome is well recognized by paediatriaticians What is new: • Life-threatening hypophosphatemia is an uncommon presentation • These electrolytes disorders may indicate an aggressive tumour genesis process even at presentation and require urgent treatment.\n",
      "Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 362 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) proliferating cell and 90 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were analysed for S-phase fractions, Ki67 antigen, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. The S-phase fractions were correlated with in vitro drug resistance to 15 different anticancer agents. Leukaemia cells isolated from bone marrow had higher S-phase fractions than leukaemia cells isolated from peripheral blood (in initial ALL, median values resp. 6.9 and 2.7%, in initial AML resp. 5.3 and 1.3%; both P<0.01). Relapse ALL samples derived from bone marrow showed increased S-phase fractions (median 9.9%) compared with initial ALL samples (median 6.9%; P<0.01). ALL samples obtained at initial diagnosis showed higher S-phase fractions (median 6.9%) and higher Ki67 expression (median 30%) than initial AML samples (median resp. 5.3 and 14%; both P<0.05). The S-phase fractions were not related to white blood cell count, age, or gender. Within initial ALL, the S-phase fraction correlated significantly but modestly strong (rho=0.3-0.5; P<0.05) with sensitivity to antimetabolites (cytarabine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine), L-asparaginase, teniposide, and vincristine. Similar results were found within subgroups of initial ALL (nonhyperdiploid and common/precursor-B-lineage ALL). In relapsed ALL and AML such correlations were not found. In conclusion, cell proliferation differs between leukaemia subgroups and increased proliferation is associated with increased in vitro sensitivity to several anticancer agents in initial ALL.\n",
      "Chromosomal rearrangements involving the MECOM (MDS1 and EVI1 complex) locus are recurrent genetic events in myeloid leukaemia and are associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we assessed the role of MECOM locus protein EVI1 in the transcriptional regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the leukaemic phenotype. For this, we profiled expression of 366 miRNAs in 38 MECOM-rearranged patient samples, normal bone marrow controls and MECOM (EVI1) knock down/re-expression models. Cross-comparison of these miRNA expression profiling data showed that MECOM rearranged leukaemias are characterized by down regulation of MIR449A. Reconstitution of MIR449A expression in MECOM-rearranged cell line models induced apoptosis resulting in a strong decrease in cell viability. These effects might be mediated in part by MIR449A regulation of NOTCH1 and BCL2, which are shown here to be bona fide MIR449A targets. Finally, we confirmed that MIR449A repression is mediated through direct promoter occupation of the EVI1 transcriptional repressor. In conclusion, this study reveals MIR449A as a crucial direct target of the MECOM locus protein EVI1 involved in the pathogenesis of MECOM-rearranged leukaemias and unravels NOTCH1 and BCL2 as important novel targets of MIR449A. This EVI1-MIR449A-NOTCH1/BCL2 regulatory axis might open new possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies in this poor prognostic leukaemia subgroup.\n",
      "A great challenge when conducting ex vivo studies of leukaemia is the construction of an appropriate experimental platform that would recapitulate the bone marrow (BM) environment. Such a 3D scaffold system has been previously developed in our group [1]. Additionally to the BM architectural characteristics, parameters such as oxygen and glucose concentration are crucial as their value could differ between patients as well as within the same patient at different stages of treatment, consequently affecting the resistance of leukaemia to chemotherapy. The effect of oxidative and glucose stress-at levels close to human physiologic ones-on the proliferation and metabolic evolution of an AML model system (K-562 cell line) in conventional 2D cultures as well as in 3D scaffolds were studied. We observed that the K-562 cell line can proliferate and remain alive for 2 weeks in medium with glucose close to physiological levels both in 20 and 5% O2. We report interesting differences on the cellular response to the environmental, i.e., oxidative and/or nutritional stress stimuli in 2D and 3D. Higher adaptation to oxidative stress under non-starving conditions is observed in the 3D system. The glucose level in the medium has more impact on the cellular proliferation in the 3D compared to the 2D system. These differences can be of significant importance both when applying chemotherapy in vitro and also when constructing mathematical tools for optimisation of disease treatment.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether risks of leukaemia are related to occupational exposure to magnetic fields. METHODS: The mortality experienced by a cohort of 83 997 employees of the former Central Electricity Generating Board of England and Wales was investigated for the period 1973-97. All employees were employed for at least 6 months with some employment in the period 1973-82. Computerised work histories were available for 79 972 study subjects for the period 1971-93. Detailed calculations were performed by others to enable a novel assessment to be made of exposures to magnetic fields. Two analytical approaches were used, indirect standardisation (n=83 997) and Poisson regression (n=79 972). RESULTS: Based on serial mortalities for England and Wales, the standardised mortality ratio of 84 for all leukaemias (observed 111, expected 132.3) was similar to that of 83 for all causes (observed 14 845, expected 17 918). No significant positive trends were found for the risks of various types of leukaemia (chronic lymphatic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, all leukaemia) either with lifetime cumulative exposure to magnetic fields or with such exposures received in the most recent 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: There are no discernible excess risks of leukaemia as a consequence of occupational exposure to magnetic fields in United Kingdom electricity generation and transmission workers.\n",
      "Forty-two patients with acute leukaemia were treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) using a combination chemotherapy protocol for bone marrow ablation. The response to high-dose chemotherapy and ABMT and its associated morbidity and mortality have been compared in 24 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 18 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In 16 patients with AML treated with ABMT during first complete remission (CR), ten patients (62.5%) remain in unmaintained remission; median follow up is 32 months. In eight patients with ALL treated in first CR, only one remains in remission 32 months post-ABMT, with three patients dying non-leukaemic deaths. Fourteen of 18 patients (AML and ALL) treated after first remission have died of recurrent leukaemia, two died non-leukaemic deaths and two remain well 31 and 55 months post-ABMT; both have ALL. The length of hospital stay and the amount of blood product support were similar in both groups. Haematological recovery post-ABMT was delayed in patients with AML compared to patients with ALL but this difference was not significant. Rapidly progressive lung infection was thought to be the cause of four early deaths (4/18) in patients with ALL but none in patients with AML. Severe gram-negative infections were significantly more common in patients with AML.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is one of the most common haematological malignancies and is increasing in frequency due to an ageing population. Whilst remission will be achieved in up to 80% of those receiving intensive chemotherapy, the main variables precluding cure are the treatment-related mortality and relapse rates. Decisions on intensification, de-escalation and allografting rely on the ability to divide an apparently homogeneous group according to risk. A wide range of clinical, cytogenetic and molecular variables may be used to inform this task. Cytogenetic and molecular characterisation has already identified subgroups, such as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) with t(15;17)/PML-RARA and AML with FLT3 mutation for which targeted therapies are available, and further molecularly defined groups who may be potential candidates for this approach are likely to be identified in the future. This review examines the range of established clinical and diagnostic parameters that should be used in assessing prognosis for a patient with AML and looks ahead to an expanding repertoire of potential variables that are currently under evaluation.\n",
      "Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) is a fatal, mixed myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorder of early childhood. A number of significant advances have been achieved in recent years. The present review will focus on the pathogenesis and management of JMML. Specific defects in the RAS signalling pathway, which make JMML cells hypersensitive to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, are observed in at least two-thirds of patients with JMML: inactivation of NF1 or mutations in NRAS, KRAS2 or PTPN11. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the only treatment able to cure JMML, although the high postrelapse rate is of great concern. We also review molecularly targeted therapeutics that interfere with the disrupted activation of the RAS signal transduction pathway.\n",
      "Occurrences of second malignancies in hairy cell leukaemia are well recognised. Most of these malignancies are either solid tumours or lymphoproliferative disorders. The association of myeloproliferative disorders with hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is very rare. This report describes a case of a patient with HCL who after remaining in remission developed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), which rapidly transformed to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with further cytogenetic abnormalities.\n",
      "The EBMT risk score is an established tool successfully used in the prognosis of survival post-HSCT and is applicable for a range of haematological disorders. One of its main advantages is that score generation involves summation of clinical parameters that are available pretransplant. However, the EBMT risk score is recognized as not being optimal. Previous analyses, involving patients with various diagnoses, have shown that non-HLA gene polymorphisms influence outcome after allogeneic HSCT. This study is novel as it focuses only on patients having acute leukaemia (N = 458) and attempts to demonstrate how non-HLA gene polymorphisms can be added to the EBMT risk score in a Cox regression model to improve prognostic ability for overall survival. The results of the study found that three genetic factors improved EBMT risk score. The presence of MAL (rs8177374) allele T in the patient, absence of glucocorticoid receptor haplotype (consisting of rs6198, rs33389 and rs33388) ACT in the patient and absence of heat-shock protein 70-hom (+2437) (rs2227956) allele C in the patient were associated with decreased survival time. When compared to the EBMT risk score, the scores combining EBMT risk score with the genetic factors had an improved correlation with clinical outcome and better separation of risk groups. A bootstrapping technique, involving repeated testing of a model using multiple validation sets, also revealed that the newly proposed model had improved predictive value when compared to the EBMT risk score alone. Results support the view that non-HLA polymorphisms could be useful for pretransplant clinical assessment and provide evidence that polymorphisms in the recipient genotype may influence incoming donor cells, suppressing the initiation of the graft versus leukaemia effect and reducing survival.\n",
      "The low-cell-dose (LD) and the high-cell-dose (HD) transplant variants of the SA7 murine myeloid leukaemia cell line have different growth characteristics and clinical presentations. In addition, the low-cell-dose transplant subline (SA7LD) was more responsive than the high-cell-dose variant (SA7HD) to mitoxantrone treatment in vivo. Bone-marrow cells of mice cured of SA7LD leukaemia, as well as bone-marrow cells of normal mice treated with priming doses of mitoxantrone in vivo became significantly (p = 0.012) less sensitive to subsequent treatment with mitoxantrone in vitro. This effect was detected by both the colony assay and the tritiated thymidine uptake assay. There appears to be a correlation between the ability of normal bone-marrow cells present in leukaemic mice to develop this protective effect and their ability to survive chemotherapy with mitoxantrone. The protective effect was \"lost\" by bone-marrow cells of mice dying while in remission. Doses of mitoxantrone that resulted in the loss of protective effect by bone-marrow cells of normal mice were found to be fatal to SA7HD leukaemia-bearing mice. However, these doses were not toxic to normal mice.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is the commonest indication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) worldwide. The accumulated experience of allografting in AML over the last four decades has provided critical insights into both the contribution of the conditioning regimen and the graft-versus-leukaemia effect to the curative potential of the most common form of immunotherapy utilised in standard clinical practice. Coupled with advances in donor availability and transplant technologies, this has resulted in allo-SCT becoming an important treatment modality for the majority of adults with high-risk AML. At the same time, advances in genomic classification, coupled with progress in the accurate quantification of measurable residual disease, have increased the precision with which allo-mandatory patients can be identified, whilst simultaneously permitting accurate identification of those patients who can be spared the toxicity of an allograft. Despite this progress, disease recurrence still remains a major cause of transplant failure and AML has served as a paradigm for the development of strategies to reduce the risk of relapse - notably the novel concept of post-transplant maintenance, utilising pharmacological or cellular therapies.\n",
      "Factors influencing the outcome for 39 children with haematological malignancy who were subjected to a cord blood transplantation (CBT) from genotypically HLA-mismatched unrelated donors were analysed. This retrospective study included 21 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 15 with acute myelogenous leukaemia and one each with chronic myelogenous leukaemia, refractory anaemia with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML). Those subjected to CBT during the first or second complete remission (CR) and MDS without blasts were assigned to the standard-risk (SR) group (n = 16). Patients in third or subsequent remission, relapse or partial remission with refractory leukaemia at the time of CBT were considered to be in advanced phase, and placed in the high-risk (HR) group (n = 11). JMML and the second CR after a relapse (n = 8), or bone marrow failure after a rejection (n = 3), following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the first CR were included in the high-risk group. Kaplan-Meier estimates for neutrophil and platelet recovery were 83.7 +/- 12.2 at d 60 and 55.4 +/- 16.6% at d 100 respectively. The incidence of grades II-VI acute graft-versus-host disease was 58.5 +/- 16.8%. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was 49.2 +/- 16.6. From multivariate analysis, the most important factor influencing EFS was disease status at CBT: SR patients had a 3-year EFS of 75.0 +/- 21.6%, compared with 29.6 +/- 20.6% for those with HR disease (P = 0.013, RR 4.746, 95% CI 1.382-16.298). These data confirm that HLA-mismatched, unrelated CBT is a feasible procedure to cure a significant proportion of children with leukaemia, especially if conducted in a favourable phase of the disease.\n"

      "STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test a large set of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma registrations for the presence of clusters in space and in time. DESIGN: The study was a space-time cluster analysis. SETTING: England, Wales and Scotland. PATIENTS: All registrations for leukaemia and lymphoma between 1966 and 1983 in children aged 0 to 14 years were examined. The records included date and age of registration, sex, diagnosis, and the map reference of the postcode of residence. Of the 9411 registrations, 8888 were suitable for inclusion. MAIN RESULTS: There was a statistically significant excess of case pairs occurring jointly within 0.5 km and 60 d of each other: 68 pairs compared with 50.0 expected. The excess was detectable in central England, in the north of England and Scotland, but not in the south west of England. It was concentrated within the age band 4 to 7 years and among the lymphatic leukaemias. Several potential artefacts were considered and excluded, but the possibility remained that clustered detections might be triggered by haematological examinations undertaken for some communicable disease. CONCLUSIONS: There was strong evidence of joint spatial-temporal clustering, with an excess of pairs separated by very short time and distance intervals. The causes are probably biological rather than artefactual, but further work will be necessary in order to exclude the latter.\n",
      "Recurrent chromosomal translocations producing a chimaeric MLL oncogene give rise to a highly aggressive acute leukaemia associated with poor clinical outcome. The preferential involvement of chromatin-associated factors as MLL fusion partners belies a dependency on transcription control. Despite recent progress made in targeting chromatin regulators in cancer, available therapies for this well-characterized disease remain inadequate, prompting the need to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, using unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 technology to perform a genome-scale loss-of-function screen in an MLL-AF4-positive acute leukaemia cell line, we identify ENL as an unrecognized gene that is specifically required for proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To explain the mechanistic role of ENL in leukaemia pathogenesis and dynamic transcription control, a chemical genetic strategy was developed to achieve targeted protein degradation. Acute loss of ENL suppressed the initiation and elongation of RNA polymerase II at active genes genome-wide, with pronounced effects at genes featuring a disproportionate ENL load. Notably, an intact YEATS chromatin-reader domain was essential for ENL-dependent leukaemic growth. Overall, these findings identify a dependency factor in acute leukaemia and suggest a mechanistic rationale for disrupting the YEATS domain in disease.\n",
      "Novel therapies with increased efficacy and decreased toxicity are desperately needed for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The anti CD33 immunoconjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), was withdrawn with concerns over induction mortality and lack of efficacy. However a number of recent trials suggest that, particularly in AML with favourable cytogenetics, GO may improve overall survival. This data and the development of alternative novel monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have renewed interest in the area. Leukaemic stem cells (LSC) are identified as the subset of AML blasts that reproduces the leukaemic phenotype upon transplantation into immunosuppressed mice. AML relapse may be caused by chemoresistant LSC and this has refocused interest on identifying and targeting antigens specific for LSC. Several mAb have been developed that target LSC effectively in xenogeneic models but only a few have begun clinical evaluation. Antibody engineering may improve the activity of potential new therapeutics for AML. The encouraging results seen with bispecific T cell-engaging mAb-based molecules against CD19 in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphobalstic leukaemia, highlight the potential efficacy of engineered antibodies in the treatment of acute leukaemia. Potent engineered mAb, possibly targeting novel LSC antigens, offer hope for improving the current poor prognosis for AML.\n",
      "Retrotransposons such as LINE-1 and Alu comprise >25% of the human genome. While global hypomethylation of these elements has been widely reported in solid tumours, their epigenetic dysregulation is yet to be characterised in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and there has been scant consideration of their evolutionary history that mediates sensitivity to hypomethylation. Here, we developed an approach for locus- and evolutionary subfamily-specific analysis of retrotransposons using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K microarray platform, which we applied to publicly-available datasets from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and other haematological malignancies. We identified 9,797 microarray probes mapping to 117 LINE-1 subfamilies and 13,130 mapping to 37 Alu subfamilies. Of these, 10,782 were differentially methylated (PFDR<0.05) in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients (n=139) compared with healthy individuals (n=14), with enrichment at enhancers (p=0.002). Differential methylation was associated with evolutionary age of LINE-1 (r2=0.31, p=0.003) and Alu (r2=0.74, p=0.002) elements, with greater hypomethylation of older subfamilies (L1M, AluJ). Locus-specific hypomethylation was associated with differential expression of proximal genes, including DCLK2, HK1, ILRUN, TANK, TBCD, TNFRSF1B and TXNRD2, with higher expression of DCLK2 and TNFRSF1B associated with reduced patient survival. Hypomethylation at nine loci was highly frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (>90% patients) but not observed in healthy individuals or other leukaemias, and was detectable in blood samples taken prior to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia diagnosis in 9 of 82 individuals from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. Our results demonstrate differential methylation of retrotransposons in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia by their evolutionary heritage that modulates expression of proximal genes.\n",
      "The association of small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with different malignancies has been reported in the literature. Also the occurrence of a second haematological disease has been described, more frequently as a secondary event in patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents. We report a case of CLL with concurrent acute myeloid leukaemia in an untreated patient, with emphasis on the need of a detailed immunomorphological study to identify the coexistence of the two diseases in the same pathological tissue.\n",
      "With the introduction of potent immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic medications for various diseases, there is an increased incidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. They are the result of mutational rearrangement and historically, have a grave prognosis compared with de novo myeloid neoplasms. We did a short review on various types of myeloid leukaemias reported after therapy with antitumour necrosis factor and also report, to the best of our knowledge, one among the very few cases of therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukaemia in a patient on infliximab therapy for refractory Crohn disease. The patient responded well to the traditional treatment and is in complete remission for more than 5 years.\n",
      "Identification of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) synthesized by three human leukaemic cell lines-Jurkat (T-cell leukaemia), Daudi (Burkitt lymphoma, B-cell leukaemia) and THP-1 (acute monocytic leukemia)-and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and their distribution among cell membrane and culture medium were studied. GAGs were isolated using ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and their composition and fine chemical structure were studied using high-performance liquid chromatography with radiochemical detection. All cell lines synthesize chondroitin sulphate (CS) and heparan sulphate (HS) in both cell membrane and culture medium. No hyaluronan was detected using treatment with specific lyases and highly sensitive HPLC methodology. CS is the major secreted GAG in all cell lines tested and the major cell retained GAG in Jurkat and Daudi. HS is the major GAG in the cell membrane of THP-1. The amounts of distinct GAGs synthesized by all cancer cell lines differ from those produced by normal PBML indicating a major role of GAGs in malignant transformation of human lymphocytes and monocytes.\n",
      "Secondary leukaemia following treatment of M3 acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is a rare event. We describe a patient in remission following chemotherapy for APL who relapsed with M2 acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL). The original t(15;17) (q22;q21) chromosome translocation was lost and replaced by a clone containing a dic(5;17) (q11;p11) abnormality. Southern genomic analysis demonstrated re-arrangements of the retinoic acid receptor varies; is directly proportional to (RAR varies; is directly proportional to) and PML genes in the APL blasts at presentation but not in the M2 ANLL marrow at relapse. The significance of unbalanced 5;17 translocations as markers for therapy-related secondary leukaemia is discussed.\n",
      "Double-unit cord blood (CB) grafts may improve engraftment and relapse risk in adults with haematological malignancies. We performed a prospective high-dose myeloablative double-unit CB transplantation (CBT) trial in adults with high-risk acute leukaemia or myelodysplasia (MDS) between 2007 and 2011. The primary aim was to establish the 1-year overall survival in a multi-centre setting. Fifty-six patients (31 acute myeloid leukaemia, 19 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 4 other acute leukaemias, 2 myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) were transplanted at 10 centres. The median infused total nucleated cell doses were 2·62 (larger unit) and 2·02 (smaller unit) x 10(7) /kg. The cumulative incidence of day 100 neutrophil engraftment was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80-96). Day 180 grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence was 64% (95%CI: 51-76) and 36% (95%CI: 24-49) of patients had chronic GVHD by 3-years. At 3-years post-transplant, the transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 39% (95%CI: 26-52), and the 3-year relapse incidence was 11% (95%CI: 4-21). With a median 37-month (range 23-71) follow-up of survivors, the 3-year disease-free survival was 50% (95%CI: 37-63). Double-unit CBT is a viable alternative therapy for high-risk acute leukaemia/ MDS in patients lacking a matched unrelated donor. This is especially important for minority patients. The relapse incidence was low but strategies to ameliorate TRM are needed.\n",
      "Objective responses obtained with high-dose in vivo recombinant interleukin 2 (r-IL2) in some leukaemic patients suggest among other hypotheses that blasts might express tumour rejection antigens potentially recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes. Such antigens have been described in human melanomas and the MAGE-1 gene, coding for a tumour rejection antigen was recently identified. This gene is expressed in various solid tumours, but not in normal cells. We have screened a panel of haematological malignancies by reverse transcription and PCR and we report that MAGE-1 is not expressed in the blasts from 48 patients whereas three cell lines derived from leukaemias express this gene.\n",
      "Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is a rare extramedullary tumour consisting of immature myeloid precursors. It occurs most commonly in association with myeloid leukaemias and myeloproliferative disorders. Rarely there may be no evidence of haematological malignancy. We describe neurological presentations of GS in two patients with Philadelphia (Ph) positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). In both cases the bone marrow was in chronic phase at the time of presentation of the GS, but there was rapid subsequent transformation into the blastic phase.\n",
      "CXCR4 is expressed on leukaemia cells and haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and its ligand stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) is produced abundantly by stromal cells in the bone marrow (BM). The SDF-1/CXCR4 axis plays important roles in homing to and retention in the protective BM microenvironment of malignant leukaemia cells and normal HSCs. CXCR4 expression is regulated by multiple mechanisms and the level of CXCR4 expression on leukaemia cells has prognostic indications in patients with acute leukaemia. CXCR4 antagonists can mobilize leukaemia cells from BM to circulation, which render them effectively eradicated by chemotherapeutic agents, small molecular inhibitors or hypomethylating agents. Therefore, such combinational therapies have been tested in clinical trials. However, new evidence emerged that drug-resistant leukaemia cells were not affected by CXCR4 antagonists, and the migration of certain leukaemia cells to the leukaemia niche was independent of SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. In this review, we summarize the role of CXCR4 in progression and treatment of acute leukaemia, with a focus on the potential of CXCR4 as a therapeutic target for acute leukaemia. We also discuss the potential value of using CXCR4 antagonists as chemosensitizer for conditioning regimens and immunosensitizer for graft-vs-leukaemia effects of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n",
      "The increasing tendency for people to work outside their home community--one of the most striking of modern demographic changes--has relevance to a recent aetiological hypothesis about childhood leukaemia: that a community immune response to an underlying infection can be disturbed by increases in new social contacts. This was tested in the only 28 former county boroughs in which accurate comparisons of workplace data from the 1971 and 1981 censuses are possible--because their boundaries were left unaltered by the major reorganisation in 1974. After ranking the districts according to extent of commuting increase, a significant trend in leukaemia incidence was found at ages 0-14 (P less than 0.05) and a suggestive one at ages 0-4 (P = 0.055). Among ten similar sized groups of county districts ranked by commuting increase, the only significant increases (P less than 0.001) of leukaemia in 1972-85 at ages 0-4 and 0-14 were in the highest tenth for commuting increase. These excesses persisted after excluding Reading, a major part of an area where an excess of leukaemia has been linked to the nearby nuclear establishments at Aldermaston and Burghfield. This whole area has experienced greater commuting increases than 90% of county districts in England and Wales. The findings are consistent with other evidence supporting the above hypothesis; they also suggest that contacts between adults may influence the incidence of leukaemia in children.\n",
      "Acute renal failure is a well-recognized complication of acute leukaemias. Howevcr, serious renal failure caused by leukaemic infiltration as a primary manifestation is unusual. Here we report two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia presenting with acute renal failure due to leukaemic infiltration. The first patient died before the administration of specific therapy for leukaemia, whereas the second case recovered after chemotherapy. She was discharged without necessitating dialysis therapy.\n",
      "Although leukaemic infiltration of the pericardium is frequently observed at post-mortem, clinically evident cardiac tamponade is rare. Two cases of cardiac tamponade complicating leukaemia are presented. One patient had cardiac tamponade as the initial presentation of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and experienced complete resolution of the pericardial effusion within 6 days after chemotherapy without therapeutic pericardiocentesis. The other patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia developed cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis as the first sign of acute blastic transformation. The roles of early chemotherapy and pericardiocentesis in managing this complication are discussed.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to determine the therapy-related risk factors for the occurrence of leukaemia after childhood solid cancer. Among 4204 3-year survivors of a childhood cancer treated in eight French and British centres before 1986, 11 patients developed leukaemia as a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). Compared with the leukaemia incidence in the general French and British populations, the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of leukaemia was 7.8 (95% CI 4.0-13.4). It decreased from 20.3 (95% CI 8.3-41.2) during the first years of follow-up, to 2.2 (95% CI 0.1-9.7) between 10 and 20 years, but rose again to 14.8 (95% CI 3.7-38.3) 20 or more years after the first cancer. Radiotherapy appeared to increase the risk of leukaemia at moderate weighted doses to active bone marrow; the relative risk (RR) was 4.2 (95% CI 0.8-20.7) for doses ranging from 3 to 6.6 Gy. A greater RR was observed for epipodophyllotoxins and for vinca alkaloids. No specific type of first malignant neoplasm (FMN) was found to lead to a higher risk of secondary leukaemia. Epipodophyllotoxins and vinca alkaloids at high doses and moderate weighted radiation doses to active bone marrow may contribute independently to an increased risk of leukaemia for patients treated for childhood cancer. Our results suggest that the long-term risk of secondary leukaemia could be higher than previously reported.\n",
      "Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is a peculiar sub-type of acute myeloblastic leukaemia characterised by presence of atypical promyelocytes in bone marrow and peripheral blood and common occurrence of haemorrhagic episodes associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Two morphological forms of APL are recognised--typical hypergranular and microgranular or M3 variant. This microgranular form of APL is rare but has got some peculiar features and often can be diagnosed by peripheral blood smear examination alone without bone marrow examination. Three cases of microgranular form of APL observed during a period of 6 months are reported here.\n",
      "The architectural transcription factor HMGA2 is highly expressed during embryogenesis but scarcely detectable in non-dividing adult cells. Previously, HMGA2 re-expression was detected in blood from CML patients by conventional RT-PCR, while blood samples from healthy volunteers were HMGA2 negative. Using the sensitive method of real-time quantitative RT-PCR, herein HMGA2 expression was detectable not only in peripheral blood from leukaemia patients but also in blood from healthy donors. Statistical analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between white blood cell count and HMGA2 transcript levels. The results indicate that up-regulation of HMGA2 expression is correlated to the undifferentiated phenotype of leukaemic cells accumulating during progression of chronic phase to blast crisis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Lymphohaematopoietic malignancies are common in the general population. There have been concerns that military service may be associated with increased risk as a result of occupational exposures. To date, few studies have demonstrated an increased risk, although a disability pension is payable to veterans who were present at nuclear tests and who develop leukaemia (other than chronic lymphocytic leukaemia). The aim of the study was to utilise data from the Scottish Veterans Health Study to examine the risk of lymphohaematopoietic malignancy following military service in a large national cohort of veterans. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 57,000 veterans and 173,000 non-veterans born between 1945 and 1985 matched for age, sex and area of residence, adjusted for areal deprivation and followed up for up to 30 years, using Cox proportional hazard models to compare the risk of lymphohaematopoietic malignancy overall, by diagnosis and by sex and birth cohort. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant difference in risk between veterans and non-veterans either for all leukaemias (Cox proportional hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence intervals 0.84-1.27, p=0.773), Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence intervals 0.87-1.61, p=0.272) or for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence intervals 0.71-1.04, p=0.110). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide reassurance that service in the UK Armed Forces is not associated with increased risk of lymphohaematopoietic malignancy.\n",
      "AIM: The frequency of employing radiography is increasing. Long-term risks of performing X-ray procedures on children and adolescents for medical diagnosis have raised significant concerns. METHODS: In this study, we adopt the case-control methodology to evaluate the relationship between the incidence rate of acute leukaemia and exposure to radiation during diagnostic X-ray examinations for children. Based on 1998-2010 data obtained from the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance database, we selected 58 children with leukaemia and randomly selected an additional 232 children as the control group. RESULTS: The mean age of children with leukaemia is 8.92 ± 5.24 years. The risk of leukaemia in children who underwent X-ray examinations increased 2.14-fold (95% CI, 1.18-3.87). In this study, we identified that, when undergoing X-ray examinations, the risk of leukaemia in children increased for both sex and age groups. Specifically, the relationship between leukaemia and X-ray in boys (OR = 3.28, 95%CI, 1.33-8.07) and in ages of 6 to 11 years (OR = 2.58, 95%CI, 1.09-6.10) was significant. Overall, the risk of leukaemia in children who underwent X-ray examinations progressively increased from a ratio of 1.65 to 3.14. Moreover, an identical trend was observed for boys (1.85 to 6.42). CONCLUSION: Exposure to X-ray increased the risk of leukaemia in children.\n",
      "AIMS: Morphological differentiation among different blast cell lineages is a difficult task and there is a lack of automated analysers able to recognise these abnormal cells. This study aims to develop a machine learning approach to predict the diagnosis of acute leukaemia using peripheral blood (PB) images. METHODS: A set of 442 smears was analysed from 206 patients. It was split into a training set with 75% of these smears and a testing set with the remaining 25%. Colour clustering and mathematical morphology were used to segment cell images, which allowed the extraction of 2,867 geometric, colour and texture features. Several classification techniques were studied to obtain the most accurate classification method. Afterwards, the classifier was assessed with the images of the testing set. The final strategy was to predict the patient diagnosis using the PB smear, and the final assessment was done with the cell images of the smears of the testing set. RESULTS: The highest classification accuracy was achieved with the selection of 700 features with linear discriminant analysis. The overall classification accuracy for the six groups of cell types was 85.8%, while the overall classification accuracy for individual smears was 94% as compared with the true confirmed diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method achieves a high diagnostic precision in the recognition of different types of blast cells among other mononuclear cells circulating in blood. It is the first encouraging step towards the idea of being a diagnostic support tool in the future.\n",
      "This is the first attempt to systematically record haematological malignancies in Northern Ireland. The methods are identical to a similar effort in other parts of the UK, except that an independent cross check with a cancer registry source was not possible. In addition problems with the census may create differences. Generally, the rates for the leukaemias are slightly lower than in England and Wales, except for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia whilst non-Hodgkin lymphoma rates are higher. It remains to be seen how stable this situation is as further data are accumulated.\n",
      "Poland syndrome has been sporadically associated with haematological neoplasms, namely acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukaemias and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The authors present the case of a child in whom this syndrome coexists with a Philadelphia negative, chronic granulocytic leukaemia, which has only required one course of treatment with busulphan in two and a half years of follow-up.\n",
      "Serum aldolase concentrations were determined in 78 patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Mean serum aldolase concentration (+/- SD) at the time of diagnosis was 28.3 U/L (+19.4). 71.8% of AML patients had increased serum aldolase concentrations. The highest hyperaldolasaemia were observed in patients with acute myelomonocytic leukaemia and acute monoblastic leukaemia. The monocytic involvement in AML patients was significantly related to serum aldolasaemia. Human aldolase gene has been located on chromosome 16, whose structural aberrations are frequent in AML patients with monocytic involvement, explaining the link between serum hyperaldolasaemia and the monocytic involvement in AML patients.\n",
      "The outcome of treatment with standard first line therapy of 66 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) secondary to preceding chemotherapy (Group 1), a myelodysplastic state (Group 2) or a myeloproliferative disorder (Group 3) was analysed in relation to the preceding disorder, the cytogenetic pattern where available, and the cytology and cytochemistry of blood and bone marrow. The complete remission (CR) rate for the secondary AMLs was 36% (24/66), with 24% (16/66) dying in the induction period and 39% (26/66) having resistant disease. The CR rate was 25% (5/20) for Group 1, 42% (15/36) for Group 2, and 40% (4/10) for Group 3. Even after allowance for the generally older age of the secondary AML patients, they still had a significantly poorer CR rate than the de novo AMLs (P = 0.0004). The lower CR rate was chiefly due to resistant disease. Despite this, overall survival was not significantly worse for the secondary AML patients (P = 0.15). For the 36% that achieved remission, remission duration appeared similar to that of de novo cases. Of 62 cases with adequate cytology, 38 (61%) had evidence of erythroid and/or megakaryocytic dysplasia with a CR rate of 32% (12/38). The CR rate of these multineage leukaemias was not significantly different from that of the 24 (39%) who showed granulocyte/monocyte precursor involvement only, 42% (10) of whom achieved CR. The presence of features of differentiation within blast cells such as Auer rods or sudanophilia (greater than 50% positive blasts) was associated with a higher remission rate 47% (18/38) than that of poorly differentiated cases 17% (3/18) (P = 0.04) and thus appeared to be a more important determinant of CR achievement than was lineage involvement. Cases with a normal karyotype had a 33% (7/21) CR rate, while those with chromosomal abnormalities had a 37% (9/24) CR rate. Only 12 of the 45 cases with adequate cytogenetic analysis showed deletions or monosomies involving chromosomes 5 or 7, and seven of these were in Group 1.\n",
      "Paediatric patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) often present with symptoms associated with the disruption of normal haematopoiesis and subsequent cellular deficiencies. Periosteal reactions are common in paediatric leukaemia, but typically manifest as a thin, laminated pattern along long bones. Aggressive periosteal reactions are much less frequently seen. Here, we report a case of paediatric AML initially presenting with proptosis and periorbital swelling caused by aggressive, sunburst periosteal reactions surrounding the sphenoid and zygomatic bones. This unique presentation emphasises the importance of considering leukaemic infiltration in the differential for sunburst periosteal reaction in paediatric patients.\n",
      "Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is typically instituted in severe respiratory failure, defined by Lung Injury Score, and caused either by pulmonary or extra-pulmonary reversible disease processes. These processes will have led to acute worsening of oxygenation and/or respiratory acidosis together with an inability to provide safe, lung protective, mechanical ventilation. Patients with underlying chronic immunosuppression or haematological malignancies treated with ECMO for severe respiratory failure have poor short- and long-term functional and survival outcomes. Consequently, in many centres, a diagnosis of haematological malignancy is considered a contraindication to provision of ECMO support for severe respiratory failure. We present a case of a 51-year-old female who attended her local hospital with symptoms suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia. Within a few days, there was progression to severe respiratory failure, initially managed with invasive mechanical ventilation but rapidly deteriorating respiratory failure triggered referral for ECMO support. Initial investigations on ECMO demonstrated features of acute myeloblastic leukaemia with a superimposed community-acquired pneumonia. This was successfully managed with supportive treatment alongside mechanical respiratory therapy and targeted chemotherapy, achieving complete remission and full functional recovery.\n",
      "The morphologic, immunologic, genotypic and functional properties of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells or cultured cells from four patients with a clinically aggressive non-T, non-B natural killer cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ANKL/L) are described. The leukaemic cells possessed medium to large granules in the cytoplasm, antigens against CD38, CD2, OKIa 1 and NKH-1 CD56) monoclonal antibodies on their cell-surface, and also showed natural killer (NK) activity. In addition, these ANKL/L belonged to neither T- nor B-cell lineage, proved by studying clonal gene rearrangement for the T beta, T gamma and T delta receptors, and immunoglobulin. After comparing them with the seven cases of ANKL/L reported in other institutions, with regard to immunophenotype, genotype and function, we conclude that ANKL/L originating from a third lineage of lymphoid cells is a distinct clinical entity.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemias induced by ionizing radiation in mouse are characterized by chromosome (chr) 2 aberrations. While it is known that chr 2 aberrations form early and in abundance post-irradiation, unequivocal evidence for hypersensitivity of chr 2 in the first post-irradiation mitoses is lacking. Here it is established that chromosomal aberrations detected in bone marrow cells by chromosome painting are induced in all mice at an approximately 2-fold greater frequency in chr 2 by comparison with chrs 1 and 3 at 24 and 48 h following in vivo whole-body X-irradiation. Long-term follow up studies (to 15 months post-irradiation) indicated that chromosomal hypersensitivity is accounted for largely by the existence of hot-spots for aberration formation on sensitive chromosomes. Analysis of clonal developments suggested that chr 2 aberrant clones are selected for entry into the proliferating bone marrow cell compartment in preference to cells with other aberrations and that these clones in general have a higher proliferative potential. However, neither the induction of chr 2 aberrations nor the presence of a chr 2 aberrant clone specifically predict the development of AML in an individual irradiated mouse. Nonetheless these events or sub-groups of these events are necessary for AML development.\n",
      "Patients under 40 years with other than high risk disease do not benefit from an allograft in CR1, particularly if they have received gemtuzumab ozogamicin in induction. High risk can be defined by cytogenetics (Complex; abnormalities of chromosome 5 and 7; 3q-; Ph(1)) in addition, adverse features could include presentation with high white cell count or secondary disease, or a failure to have a satisfactory blast cell reduction to induction course 1 (to <15% marrow blasts), an EVI-1 mutation, although the risk with that mutation is frequently primary resistance. While there is an increasing list of molecular characteristics that could indicate a higher risk, there is in general an absence of clear evidence that they are predictive of a benefit from transplant. This does not mean that they should not be transplanted, just that it is uncertain. Some of the newer markers like minimal residual disease fall into the same category. The decision to allograft is also influenced by the estimated transplant risk. This can be minimised by high quality molecular matching techniques, the availability of a non-parous donor who is CMV seronegative and a patient with a favourable co-morbidity score. Patients who do fail first-line chemotherapy require an allograft unless the duration of first remission, which is a major determinant of outcome, is long e.g. >2 years. The possible exception to this could be core binding factor leukaemias who may have durable survival after relapse with transplant alone.\n",
      "Previous studies reported by our group have introduced a new antitumoural drug called Biphosphinic Palladacycle Complex (BPC). In this paper we show that BPC causes apoptosis in leukaemia cells (HL60 and Jurkat), but not in normal human lymphocytes. IC(50) values obtained for both cell lines using the MTT and trypan blue exclusion assays 5h after BPC treatment were lower than 8.0 microM. Using metachromatic fluorophore, acridine orange, we observed that BPC elicited lysosomal rupture of leukaemic cells. Furthermore, BPC triggered caspase-3 and caspase-6 activation and apoptosis in cell lines, inducing chromatin condensation, apoptotic bodies, and DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, the lysosomal cathepsin B inhibitor CA074 markedly decreased BPC-induced caspase-3 and caspase-6 activation as well as cell death. Lysosomal BPC-induced membrane destabilisation was not dependent on reactive oxygen species generation, which was consistent with the absence of cellular HL60 and Jurkat membrane lipid peroxidation. We conclude that, following BPC treatment, lysosomal membrane rupture precedes cell death and the apoptotic signalling pathway is initiated by the release of cathepsin B in the cytoplasm of leukaemia cells. As no toxic effects for human lymphocytes were observed, we suggest that BPC is more selective for transformed cells, mainly due to their exacerbated lysosome expression.\n",
      "This report describes a case of t(15;17) acute promyelcytic leukaemia (APL, FAB subtype M3) with dysgranulopoiesis at diagnosis in a patient who developed myelodysplasia (MDS) and then a second phenotype of t(7;21) acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML, FAB subtype M1) at the time of relapse. To our knowledge, there is no report of a second phenotype of AML occurring after complete remission (CR) of APL. Furthermore, this is the first report of chromosomal abnormality t(7;21) in a case of AML. Several hypotheses for this unusual course of APL are discussed.\n",
      "An ELISA diagnostic test for detection of bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) infected animals was developed. The test is based on the use of a mixture of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against envelope glycoprotein and against viral structural protein p24. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be dependent on the relative proportions of MAbs of the appropriate epitope specificity. Polystyrene microtitre plates, wells or sticks were firstly coated with a mixture of purified MAbs and then non-purified viral antigens were adsorbed from tissue culture fluid obtained from BLV-producing cells. The optimal conditions for adsorption of MAbs and viral antigens as well as for the ELISA procedure were established. The test is more sensitive and cheaper (no need for virus antigen purification) than the routinely used ELISA using purified virus antigens. The assay is highly specific, rapid, practical and could be easily automated. It is suitable for the detection of BLV-antibodies in blood serum or milk in the large-scale screening programs for BLV-infected animals.\n",
      "The survival from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in childhood is now approximately 60-70%, and from acute myeloid leukaemia, up to 50%. However, there is little information on the effects of intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy used in the treatment of these conditions on lung function and exercise capacity in the long term. Severity survivors of acute leukaemia from one centre in the UK were studied. Measurements of lung volumes, spirometry and transfer factor were made. Each child also performed a standard, symptom-limited maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Predictive equations for indices of lung function and exercise tolerance were calculated from 146 age- and sex-matched control subjects. The results of the survivors of leukaemia were compared to these. There was a significant reduction of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), and transfer for carbon monoxide (DLCO; P < 0.05 for each measurement), in the survivors of leukemia when compared to the control subjects. In addition, there was a mild but significant reduction of both maximal and submaximal indices of exercise capacity in the leukaemic group. A multivariate analysis was carried out to identify those variables acting independently to reduce lung volumes. For FEV1, FVC and TLC, these were craniospinal irradiation, cyclophosphamide and chest complications during treatment. For a reduction in DLCO, the significant factors were administration of anthracyclines, craniospinal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. Survivors of acute leukemia have impaired pulmonary function and exercise capacity. Long-term cardiopulmonary follow-up may be necessary and new regimens devised which reduce long-term toxicity without compromising survival rates.\n",
      "Multidrug resistance protein (MRP) activity was investigated in 44 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients using a functional assay based on efflux of carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein, an anionic dye handled by both MRP1 and MRP2. Elevated MRP transport was detected in 29% of cases, but was not significantly correlated with sex, age, white blood cell count at diagnosis or karyotype. In contrast, it was associated with secondary AML (P = 0.002), CD34 positivity (P = 0.041) and P-glycoprotein activity (P = 0.01). There was a lower rate of complete remission in MRP-positive patients versus MRP-negative patients (23% versus 81%; P = 0.001); overall survival was also better for MRP-negative patients (P = 0.004). These data indicate a probable role for MRP activity in the clinical outcome of AML.\n",
      "We have surveyed the possible mechanisms by which factor-dependent FDC-P1 cells can be rendered leukaemogenic by exposure of cells to the chemical mutagen, ethyl methane sulphonate. Cell lines established on the basis of an ability to proliferate in the absence of exogenous colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) fall into two classes; those that are maximally stimulated and show no evidence of production of CSFs and others that grow in a density-dependent manner and express granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). That the growth of this latter class can be suppressed by the inclusion of antisense GM-CSF oligonucleotides in the growth medium indicates that the basis for their in vitro proliferation, and probably their ability to initiate the formation of transplantable leukaemias, is autocrine stimulation by GM-CSF. The ability of low levels of CSF to sustain autocrine stimulation, as we have shown, raises the possibility of an autocrine basis for the proliferation of certain human leukaemic cells. The ability to detect low concentrations of CSFs and develop in vitro assays that closely mimic the conditions that exist in vivo will be important aids in the classification of human leukaemias.\n",
      "Adults with acute leukaemia and abnormalities of chromosome 11q23 have a poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy. To determine whether more intensive therapy can improve outcome for patients with this karyotypic finding, a retrospective analysis of all patients with acute leukaemia and 11q23 abnormalities treated at our centre was performed. 12 patients were treated with conventional chemotherapy alone (CC); 20 patients received high-dose chemo/radiotherapy (HDCT) with autologous (seven patients) or allogeneic (13 patients) bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The treatment-related mortality was 25% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 7-69%] for the CC group and 46% (CI 25-73%) for the BMT group (P = 0.69). Cumulative risk of leukaemia progression was 89% (CI 61-100%) in the CC patients and 38% (CI 12-69%) in the BMT patients (P = 0.001). The 2-year event-free survival for patients treated with CC was 8% (CI 0-31%) and for patients receiving HDCT and BMT was 34% (CI 14-54%) (P = 0.03). These results confirm that conventional chemotherapy is rarely curative for adults with acute leukaemia and 11q23 abnormalities but that HDCT with BMT can result in long-term survival in a significant proportion of patients.\n",
      "Monoclonal antibodies are a new class of agents targeted at specific receptors on cancer cells. In addition to direct cellular effects, antibodies can carry substances to the targeted cells, such as radioactive isotopes, toxins, and antineoplastic agents. At present monoclonal antibodies, directed against both lymphoid antigens (CD 20 and CD 52) and a myeloid antigen (CD33) are available for clinical use. In ALL, rituximab, a humanized anti CD20 antibody, has been combined to chemotherapy mainly in mature B-ALL and Burkitt lymphoma and preliminary results are promising. Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 humanized antibody, which showed anti-tumour activity in CLL; clinical effects were observed in some patients with relapsed adult ALL. Monoclonal antibodies against myeloid antigens have been prevalently used in acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), where the most utilised immunological target is CD33. The CD33 molecule is expressed by approximately 90% of AMLs but not on CD34(+) bone marrow-resident hematopoietic stem cells. The humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody HuM195 has only modest activity against overt AML, but it can eliminate minimal residual disease. Radioimmunotherapy with beta-particle-emitting isotopes targeting CD33 shows a major efficacy. Targeted chemotherapy with the anti-CD33-calicheamicin construct gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) has produced remissions as a single agent in patients with relapsed AML and appears promising when used in combination with standard chemotherapy. GO is composed of a humanized immunoglobulin G(4) (IgG(4)) monoclonal antibody (mAb), targeting the CD33 antigen and linked to a calicheamicin derivative, a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic. GO has been approved by FDA as second-line therapy in older patients with AML. The most common adverse effects of monoclonal antibodies are myelosuppression, infusion-related reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions. Rituximab may cause tumour lysis syndrome. Alemtuzumab causes immunosuppression, increasing the risk of infection. GO may cause hepatotoxicity.\n",
      "Gallium-67 (67Ga) accumulates in malignant tissues via the transferrin receptor without need for a monoclonal antibody and emits cytotoxic low-energy electrons. In this study we investigated the feasibility, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and preliminary efficiency of high-dose 67Ga injected intravenously (i.v.) in patients with acute leukaemia not responding to conventional therapy. Twelve doses of 36-105 mCi of Gallium67 citrate were administered as a push injection to eight patients with resistant leukaemia in a pilot study. All five patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) had resistant disease or resistant relapse. No (sub)acute toxicity was observed. Independent of the administered dose, whole-blood radioactivity levels 10 min after administration measured only 1.25 +/- 1.39 microCi ml-1, indicating a large volume of distribution. Urine excretion in the first 24 h ranged from 18% to 51.5% (median 29.5%) of the administered dose. Cellular uptake of 67Ga was less than in previous in vitro studies. Whole-body radiation dose was estimated to be 0.25 +/- 0.03 cGy mCi-1. Red marrow dose was estimated to be between 0.18 +/- 0.02 and 0.97 +/- 0.12 cGy mCi-1. One definite response was observed in an ALL patient with disappearance of skin lesions, normalisation of the enlarged spleen and profound leucopenia. Three other patients showed transient reductions in white blood cell counts without disappearance of blasts from the peripheral blood. We conclude that high-dose i.v. 67Ga can be safely administered but that the uptake of 67Ga in blast cells must increase to make 67Ga therapeutically useful in patients with relapsed leukaemia.\n",
      "One of the challenges of studying anticancer therapies is that effects observed in cell lines or mouse models are not always good indicators of clinical trial results. The mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukaemia has bucked this trend, as targeted therapies such as retinoic acid and arsenic induce differentiation and clearance of leukaemia cells in both mice and humans. This mouse model has also provided important mechanistic insights into the combinatorial effects of these agents and has promoted combined therapies that have shown recent success in the clinic.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of haemopoietic progenitor cells and the most common malignant myeloid disorder in adults. The median age at presentation for patients with AML is 70 years. In the past few years, research in molecular biology has been instrumental in deciphering the pathogenesis of the disease. Genetic defects are thought to be the most important factors in determining the response to chemotherapy and outcome. Whereas significant progress has been made in the treatment of younger adults, the prospects for elderly patients have remained dismal, with median survival times of only a few months. This difference is related to comorbidities associated with ageing and to disease biology. Current efforts in clinical research focus on the assessment of targeted therapies. Such new approaches will probably lead to an increase in the cure rate.\n",
      "c-Abl, the product of the cellular homologue of the transforming gene of Abelson murine leukaemia virus, has been a protein in search of a purpose for over two decades. Because c-Abl is implicated in the pathogenesis of several human leukaemias, understanding the functions of Abl is an important goal. Recently, biochemical and genetic approaches have converged to shed new light on the mechanism of regulation of c-Abl kinase activity and the multiple roles of c-Abl in cellular physiology. This review summarizes our current understanding of the many facets of c-Abl biology, emphasizing recent studies on Drosophila and mammalian Abl.\n",
      "Myeloid sarcomas are extramedullary tumours with granulocytic precursors. When associated with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), these tumours usually affect no more than two different extramedullary regions. This report describes a myeloid sarcoma associated with AML with tumour formation at five anatomical sites. The patient was a 37 year old man admitted in September 1999 with a two month history of weight loss, symptoms of anaemia, rectal bleeding, and left facial nerve palsy. The anatomical sites affected were: the rectum, the right lobe of the liver, the mediastinum, the retroperitoneum, and the central nervous system. A bone marrow smear was compatible with AML M2. Flow cytometry showed that the peripheral blood was positive for CD4, CD11, CD13, CD14, CD33, CD45, and HLA-DR. A karyotypic study of the bone marrow revealed an 8;21 translocation. The presence of multiple solid tumours in AML is a rare event. Enhanced expression of cell adhesion molecules may be the reason why some patients develop myeloid sarcomas.\n",
      "We describe the occurrence of an unusual mode of relapse in six of 24 patients who presented with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) associated with trilineage myelodysplasia (TMDS). After the induction of complete remission (CR) by intensive chemotherapy in five patients and following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in one, the myelodysplastic state, but not overt AML, recurred. Relapse of myelodysplasia occurred at a median of 147 weeks (50-520) from presentation and in two instances was followed a year later by AML. In five cases, myelodysplastic relapse was treated with low-dose cytosine arabinoside given alone or with other chemotherapeutic agents. Three patients remain in CR after 1, 2 and 5 years. The reappearance of myelodysplastic features in these six patients was strongly correlated with the presence of TMDS at presentation of the AML. It was not observed once in the 136 AML patients, treated similarly, who did not have associated TMDS at presentation (P less than 0.001). Thus, relapse with myelodysplasia is not an effect of chemotherapy as has been previously postulated.\n",
      "AIMS: To determine the incidence and outcome of congenital leukaemia. METHODS: Retrospective population based study of putative leukaemia arising during the first 3 months of life over an 18 year period within the Northern Health Region of England. RESULTS: Nine infants with putative leukaemia were identified. Five had acute leukaemia and four had transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD). Trisomy 21, either as Down syndrome or perhaps restricted to proliferating marrow cells, was present in all four infants with TMD. The incidence of congenital acute leukaemia was 8.6/10(6) live births/year, but would be less than half this value if only patients presenting within 4 weeks of birth were counted. Remission was induced in three of the five patients with acute leukaemia. One patient, who presented at birth, remains well five years after diagnosis. All four patients with TMD survive. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital leukaemia is very rare but is not inevitably fatal. Finding trisomy 21 in spontaneously dividing blood or bone marrow cells of an infant with putative acute leukaemia, particularly within 3 months of birth, should encourage a cautious clinical approach and suggests that the diagnosis might be TMD.\n",
      "Despite the high incidence of leukaemic infiltration of the heart, only 8 cases of atrioventricular block due to leukaemia have been reported in the literature. Improvement in the heart block associated with disappearance of the leukaemic infiltrate has not been reported. A rest thallium-201 study was used in a 65-year-old man to demonstrate leukaemic infiltration of the heart which was associated with complete heart block. After chemotherapy, when the tumour burden was reduced and the leukaemia in remission, his heart block resolved, and a follow-up thallium scan was normal.\n",
      "Direct immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter techniques were used for the detection of surface immunoglobulin positive (SIg+) cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) infected cattle with or without persistent lymphocytosis (PL+, PL-) and in BLV-free cattle. The percentage of SIg+ cells was more than twice as high in BLV+PL+ cattle than in BLV-free and BLV+PL- cattle. Bovine T cells, and T cell subsets were identified indirectly by the same techniques using three monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for all T cells (IL-A43), T helper (BoT4) cells (IL-A12) and T cytotoxic (BoT8) cells (IL-A17). The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) determinants of both class II (BoT4) and class I (BoT8) as well as all T cells were significantly reduced in BLV+PL+ compared to BLV-free cattle. The actual decrease in the BoT8 cell subset or the dilution effect that would change effector:target cell ratio suggests that a resultant decrease in cytotoxic activity in BLV+PL+ cattle may play an important role in the progress of BLV infection in cattle.\n",
      "The variant form of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (AML-M3) possesses its own characteristic morphology, although usually a few of the cells may have cytoplasmic features of typical AML-M3. In contrast to typical AML-M3, this M3-variant form commonly presents with hyperleucocytosis. As in typical AML-M3, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIVC) occurs in the M3-variant. A boy with this morphological variant of AML-M3 is described. Uncharacteristically, his presenting white blood count was low, and DIVC was present before treatment was started. Six days into intensive chemotherapy his coagulopathy worsened and he subsequently died of intracranial haemorrhage. An alternative approach to the treatment of AML-M3, with the use of retinoids, is discussed.\n",
      "There are conflicting reports in the literature suggesting that one gender or the other has a better survival with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The present study was done in an attempt to resolve the issue. The effect of gender was examined on 3546 newly diagnosed patients with AML, including 548 patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) enrolled in 10 multi-institutional treatment studies from March 1984 to November 2008. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to estimate event-time distributions for survival and multivariate models were used to examine the gender effect after adjusting for multiple risk factors. P values were based on two-sided tests. Non-APL female patients had a significantly better overall (OS) but not disease-free survival (DFS) than males, irrespective of age, initial white blood cell count, or dose of daunorubicin. No differences were observed for obese or FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-positive patients. Female patients with APL had a significantly better OS and DFS than male patients with APL, and differences in survival were greater for patients with t(15;17) + other cytogenetic abnormalities compared with those with t(15;17) only. Gender is an independent prognostic variable in patients with AML. Whether these survival differences are due to hormonal, genetic or pharmacokinetic differences between the sexes or differential toxin exposure such as smoking is unknown. However, the former seems less likely as patient age did not influence the survival advantage for female patients.\n",
      "We describe a case of Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia occurring simultaneously with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in a 69-yr-old male. Gene probe analysis of DNA from both peripheral blood and bone marrow provided evidence for the independent evolution of 2 clones in this case, with a predominant population showing immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement and a smaller population showing a rearrangement within the breakpoint cluster region of chromosome 22.\n",
      "Bone marrow necrosis (BMN) is a rare intravitally recognized finding in acute leukaemia with an uncertain clinical significance. The clinical events in 4 patients with AML, ALL, AMoL and blastic transformation of CGL in whom bone marrow cytology and histology revealed BMN are reviewed. One patient with BMN at clinical presentation of AML entered complete, long lasting remission with marrow restoration after the standard DAT therapy. In the three remaining patients survival after BMN diagnosis was 6, 11, and 14 weeks. Clinical, haematological, histological and marrow scanning findings and their significance for early diagnosis and means to asses the extent and evaluation of BMN will be discussed. In contrast to the most earlier reports, BMN does not appear to confer a poor prognosis in all patients with blastic leukaemia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether indoor randon or gamma radiation might play a part in myeloid leukaemia as suggested by studies based on crude geographical or geological data for exposure assessment. METHODS: For six months randon and gamma radiation was measured with solid state nuclear track detectors and thermoluminescent dosimeters in dwellings of 44 adult male cases of acute myeloid leukaemia and 211 controls (all subjects deceased). Conditional logistic regression ORs (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated for quartiles of radon and gamma radiation and for municipality and dwelling characteristics. RESULTS: The risk of leukaemia was associated with an increasing urbanisation index (p value for trend = 0.008). An increased OR was found among those living in more modern houses (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.6). Confirming the findings of a previous study in the same area, geological features bore a positive association with myeloid leukemia, even by adjusting for level of urbanisation. Contrary to expectations from the previous study, however, no association appeared between myeloid leukaemia and radon and gamma radiation; for the highest quartiles of exposure, ORs were 0.56 (95% CI 0.2 to 1.4) and 0.52 (95% CI 0.2 to 1.4), respectively. Considering only subjects who had lived > or = 20 years in the monitored home and adjusting for urbanisation, there was still no effect of exposure to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the limited numbers, the results do not in general refute a possible risk of myeloid leukaemia from exposure to indoor radon or gamma radiation, but decrease the credibility of such a relation in the area studied and also of other studies suggesting an effect without monitoring indoor radiation. Some other fairly strong determinants have appeared--that is, level of urbanisation and living in modern houses--that might need further consideration.\n",
      "Recombinant plasmid cDNA libraries representing the polyadenylated RNAs in the myeloid cell lines KG1 and ML1 have been constructed. The screening protocol has identified several clones which contain sequences homologous to RNAs expressed at high abundance in one or more of the myeloid cell lines KG1, ML1 and HL60. The relative abundances of RNAs homologous to three recombinants, pML15, pKG21 and pKGA/F5 were measured by an RNA dot hybridisation method in total RNAs isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes from leukaemic patients and normal individuals. High levels of these RNAs were observed mainly in ANLL and acute phase CML samples. The data suggest that these probes have the potential to sub-divide the ANLLs and to extend a molecular classification of the myeloid leukaemias.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: For decades, cancer research has focussed on the genetic defects that drive tumourigenesis. However, recent high-resolution sequencing studies have uncovered mounting evidence for the complementary role of epigenetic deregulation as a hallmark of haematological malignancies. The reversibility of epigenetic changes makes them suitable candidates for pharmacological manipulation and therapeutic targeting. AREAS COVERED: This review summarises the mechanisms of normal epigenetic regulation and how these are perturbed in haematological malignancies as a result of genetic alterations. The article concludes with how these can be reversed and appraises the investigational epigenetically targeted therapies in preclinical and clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: The identification of recurring alterations in components of the epigenome of leukaemia and lymphoma has driven the rapid development of highly potent epigenetically targeted therapies. This rapid development has alluded to the possibility of a personalised therapeutic approach in selected patient populations. An enhanced understanding of the biological effects of these epigenetic alterations in initiation and progression of haematological malignancies, together with a clear mechanistic insight into how the drugs reverse the phenotypes, will define their translation into routine clinical use.\n",
      "From March 1982 to December 1986, 32 patients with standard risk leukaemia were conditioned for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with low dose fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) after infusion of alkylating agents. This series includes six children and 26 adults. Minimal follow-up was 24 months. The total dose of 11 Gy, given in 5 daily fractions of 2.20 Gy, was given in the lateral position, following chemotherapy with either melphalan or cyclophosphamide. Lungs were shielded for 2 out of the 5 fractions. All patients had in vivo dosimetry. The death rate is 25% without relapse or rejection. Disease-free survival is 73% at 5 years. Toxic deaths are detailed: 2 from sepsis and veino-occlusive disease of the liver, 3 from severe graft versus host disease (GVHD), 2 from GVHD associated with virus pneumonitis and one from HIV infection. Fractionated low dose rate TBI is discussed regarding its decreased toxicity and its efficiency for disease control.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Little aetiological epidemiological research has been undertaken for major cancers occurring in teenagers and young adults (TYA). Population mixing, as a possible proxy for infectious exposure, has been well researched for childhood malignancies. We aimed to investigate effects of population mixing in this older age group using an English national cancer dataset. METHODS: Cases of leukaemia, lymphoma and central nervous system (CNS) tumours amongst 15-24 year olds in England (diagnosed 1996-2005) were included in the study. Data were obtained by ward of diagnosis and linked to 1991 census variables including population mixing (Shannon index); data on person-weighted population density and deprivation (Townsend score) were also used and considered as explanatory variables. Associations between TYA cancer incidence and census variables were investigated using negative binomial regression, and results presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 6251 cases of leukaemia (21%), lymphoma (49%) and CNS tumours (30%) were analysed. Higher levels of population mixing were associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of CNS tumours (IRR=0.83, 95% CI=0.75-0.91), accounted for by astrocytomas and 'other CNS tumours'; however, there was no association with leukaemia or lymphoma. Incidence of CNS tumours and lymphoma was 3% lower in more deprived areas (IRR=0.97, 95% CI=0.96-0.99 and IRR=0.97, 95% CI=.96-0.98 respectively). Population density was not associated with the incidence of leukaemia, lymphoma or CNS tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a possible role for environmental risk factors with population correlates in the aetiology of CNS tumours amongst TYAs. Unlike studies of childhood cancer, associations between population mixing and the incidence of leukaemia and lymphoma were not observed.\n",
      "Transposition of the abl gene was demonstrated in seven Philadelphia (Ph'-) negative patients with either chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) or acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) by chromosomal in situ hybridization. In six out of seven CML patients and one out of two ALL patients, a significant accumulation of abl hybridization grains was localized to chromosome 22. Hybridization with both abl and sis resulted in the consistent formation of double hybridization events on chromosome 22. Transposition of abl was not apparent in one patient with Ph'-negative CML and in one patient with Ph'-negative ALL. The data suggest that transposition of abl to chromosome 22 is a feature of a particular subgroup of Ph'-negative leukaemias.\n",
      "Granulocytic sarcoma, also known as myeloid sarcoma, is an extramedullary tumour composed of immature myeloid cells. Granulocytic sarcoma is typically found in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, accelerated phase or blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or as an isolated event without bone marrow involvement. We present a case of granulocytic sarcoma in a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia in the setting of complete haematological, molecular and cytogenetic remission. Our patient was first treated with imatinib for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia. After maintaining remission for 42 months, he developed a granulocytic sarcoma in his spine. In this case report, we describe our case, along with the three other cases reported in the literature. In addition to being a rare diagnosis, this case demonstrates the importance of being vigilant in diagnosing the cause of back pain and atypical symptoms in patients with a history of leukaemia.\n",
      "We describe eight cases of erythroleukaemia distinct from FAB-AML M6, which demonstrate minimal erythroid differentiation not associated with a myeloblastic component. Three infants (including a Down syndrome) and two adults presented with a de novo leukaemia. One case was preceded by an untreated refractory anaemia with excess of blasts and one by polycythaemia vera. One case presented with an inaugural blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukaemia. In four patients the leukaemic cells showed a proerythroblast-like morphology. The four other were initially classified as undifferentiated AL (two cases) or AML MO (two cases) because of the immature aspect of the cells, their lack of myeloperoxidase activity and the absence of B, T lymphoid and myeloid (My) marker expressions apart from the CD33 antigen. Immunophenotyping in three cases showed an immature erythroblast profile (glycophorins A and B+, spectrin+). In the five others the erythroid nature was recognized by the expression of ABH blood group system on fresh cells (four cases) and glycophorin A on cells after 3 d in vitro culture with erythropoietin (EPO) + IL3 (two cases). Moreover, an erythroid colony growth of leukaemic origin was observed in three patients. In conclusion, the study of erythroid marker expression is of particular importance when immunophenotyping leukaemic cells with a proerythroblast-like morphology or an undifferentiated aspect and a HLA DR-, CD36++, B-, T-, My- (CD33 +/-) phenotype. We propose the term AML M6 'variant' for this rare type of AML.\n",
      "Correlative and functional studies support the involvement of the RUNX gene family in haematological malignancies. To elucidate the role of epigenetics in RUNX inactivation, we evaluated promoter DNA methylation of RUNX1, 2, and 3 in 23 leukaemia cell lines and samples from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and myelodysplatic syndromes (MDS) patients. RUNX1 and RUNX2 gene promoters were mostly unmethylated in cell lines and clinical samples. Hypermethylation of RUNX3 was frequent among cell lines (74%) and highly variable among patient samples, with clear association to cytogenetic status. High frequency of RUNX3 hypermethylation (85% of the 20 studied cases) was found in AML patients with inv(16)(p13.1q22) compared to other AML subtypes (31% of the other 49 cases). RUNX3 hypermethylation was also frequent in ALL (100% of the six cases) but low in MDS (21%). In support of a functional role, hypermethylation of RUNX3 was correlated with low levels of protein, and treatment of cell lines with the DNA demethylating agent, decitabine, resulted in mRNA re-expression. Furthermore, relapse-free survival of non-inv(16)(p13.1q22) AML patients without RUNX3 methylation was significantly better (P = 0·016) than that of methylated cases. These results suggest that RUNX3 silencing is an important event in inv(16)(p13.1q22) leukaemias.\n",
      "This study was undertaken to ascertain the frequency of compatible sibling donors for individuals requiring bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in Ireland. During the study period 1984-89, a total of 392 patients were HLA typed. Of these, 218 (55.6%) had a compatible sibling donor. Among the latter there were 4 degrees of compatibility: 168 (42.9%) were HLA-A,B,DR identical MLC unreactive: three (0.8%) were HLA-A,B,DR identical MLC reactive: 12 (3.0%) were HLA-A,B,DR identical (no MLC performed) and 35 (8.9%) were HLA-A, B identical (no DR or MLC performed). The leukaemias and aplastic anaemia comprised 82.9% of all requests. The majority of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (64.4%), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (51.2%), chronic myeloid leukaemia (73.9%) and aplastic anaemia (77.3%) had a potential sibling donor. Subsequently 144 of these patients had an allogeneic BMT, 79.9% of which were for patients with leukaemia (acute and chronic). This study found that there was a higher probability of finding a donor within the family than reported in most series. A clear relationship was demonstrated between family size and the likelihood of obtaining a HLA-identical sibling donor.\n",
      "Fifty-four former patients, in remission after acute leukaemia or highly malignant lymphoma, responded to a questionnaire covering their physical problems, their view of the help they received, who was most helpful to them during the treatment phase, and the impact of the disease and treatment on their current life. Energy loss and nutritional problems were most troublesome during the treatment phase, signifying many other physical problems. Patients with acute leukaemia had more problems, and thought the care was worse than did patients with highly malignant lymphoma. Serious physical problems correlated with low satisfaction with practical help received, indicating that the nurses failed to meet the needs of those suffering the most. Reduced psychological and sexual energy persisted in remission, showed no correlation with the extent of physical problems during the treatment phase, but correlated with co-existing problems and sensitivity to infections, with a great need for intimate help and counselling and with a low sense of coherence. Family relationships were said to have improved, while work and finances were negatively affected. The results indicate that nursing care should actively focus on physical problems, especially on energy loss and nutritional problems. The overwhelming fatigue hinders patients in taking physical care of themselves, and may be overlooked by the nurse since their motor capability seems intact. The long-term effect of the illness means a reduced psychological and sexual energy and a high degree of existential problems and sensitivity to infections, which indicates the importance of follow-up care, and perhaps especially of counselling for the long-term reactions and disturbance of equilibrium.\n",
      "The majority (approximately 75%) of infant acute leukaemias have a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 11q23 and one of several partner chromosomes. The gene at 11q23 (named MLL, ALL-1, HRX or HTRX-1; refs 2-6) has been cloned and shares homology with the Drosophila developmental gene trithorax. Rearrangements of this gene (called HRX here) occur in introns and cluster in a region of approximately 10 kb; individual patients have different breakpoints. Here we describe three pairs of infant twins with concordant leukaemia who each share unique (clonal) but non-constitutive HRX rearrangements in their leukaemic cells, providing evidence that the leukaemogenic event originates in utero and unequivocal support for the intra-placental 'metastasis' hypothesis for leukaemia concordance in twins.\n",
      "Intensive chemoradiotherapy with autologous bone marrow rescue has been widely explored as treatment for acute myeloblastic and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Encouraging preliminary results have been reported but in no situation has this modality of therapy been proved to be superior to conventional chemotherapy. Attempts to remove minimal residual disease from the harvested marrow have been made by both immunological and pharmacological means, but the value of such procedures has not been tested rigorously. Determination of the precise role of autologous bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of acute leukaemia must await the outcome of randomised controlled trials and will take several years.\n",
      "Relapse is the commonest cause of treatment failure following bone marrow transplantation for malignant haematological disease. Treatment options are limited and often unsuccessful, with remissions, if achieved, being short-lived. Donor lymphocyte infusions have been used in the treatment of relapsing CML for several years, with good results being obtained. Use of this form of adoptive immunotherapy however, has been much less successful in patients with acute leukaemias, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia appearing to be particularly resistant. We report the successful use of a donor lymphocyte infusion in a patient with isolated extramedullary relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia post bone marrow transplantation.\n",
      "Musculoskeletal complaints may be the initial manifestation of childhood leukaemias. When these symptoms predominate at the onset, a diagnosis of one of several rheumatic diseases may be entertained. Where blood tests are normal, no bone marrow examination would normally be indicated. The use of immune-suppressing medication, such as steroids, may lead to diagnostic delay or misdiagnosis.\n",
      "A competition ELISA technique involving two monoclonal anti-gp51 antibodies has been developed for the detection of bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) antibodies. Precoated gp51 antigen-microtitre plates were obtained by incubation of plastic adsorbed monoclonal antibody with a non-purified BLV preparation. Samples to be tested were incubated in the wells of the gp51-coated plates; the presence of anti-gp51 antibodies was indicated by competition for antigen binding with an enzyme linked monoclonal antibody directed to an important epitope on gp51. This test is as sensitive as a routinely used indirect ELISA test; it is highly specific, reliable and easy to perform.\n",
      "The excess of childhood leukaemia (CL) in Seascale, near the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site in rural NW England, suggested that an epidemic of an underlying infection, to which CL is a rare response, is promoted by marked population mixing (PM) in rural areas, in which the prevalence of susceptibles is higher than average. This hypothesis has been confirmed by 12 studies in non-radiation situations. Of the five established CL excesses near nuclear sites, four are associated with significant PM; in the fifth, the Krummel power station in Germany, the subject has not been thoroughly investigated.\n",
      "Leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for sustaining and propagating malignant disease, and, as such, are promising targets for therapy. Studies of human LSCs have served an important role in defining the major tenets of the cancer stem cell model, which centre on the frequencies of cancer stem cells, their potential hierarchical organisation and their degree of maturation. LSCs in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have recently been studied using mouse syngeneic models of leukaemia induced by MLL oncogenes. These studies have revealed that LSCs are more analogous to progenitor cells and employ embryonic stem cell-like genetic programmes for their maintenance, prompting a refinement of the original cancer stem cell model with important implications for design of therapies to selectively target LSCs.\n",
      "Primary myelodysplastic syndromes progress to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in about 30% of cases. We have sought evidence of pre-existing trilineage myelodysplasia (TMDS) using the FAB criteria (1982) in 160 consecutive cases of primary de novo AML. TMDS was found in 24 cases (15%) including two of 33 cases of M1 (6%), four of 40 cases of M2 (10%), none of 18 cases of M3, five of 31 cases of M4 (15%), six of 30 cases of M5 (20%), all of six cases of M6 and one of two cases of M7. The median presentation bone-marrow blast-cell count in the 24 AML/TMDS cases was 53% (30-90%) and 82% (45-100%) in the 136 cases of AML without TMDS. 60% of the AML/TMDS bone-marrow aspirates contained fewer than 60% of blasts compared with only 11% of those from AML without TMDS (P less than 0.001). In AML the occurrence of symptomatic cytopenias when the marrow blast-cell count is below 60% and the peripheral blood blast-cell count is below 20% is highly correlated with dysplastic haemopoiesis (P less than 0.001).\n",
      "Accurate classification of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has become increasingly reliant on molecular characterisation of this blood cancer. Throughout Australia and New Zealand massively parallel sequencing (MPS) is being adopted by diagnostic laboratories for the routine evaluation of patients with AML. This technology enables the surveying of many genes simultaneously, with many technical advantages over single gene testing approaches. However, there are many variations in wet and dry lab MPS procedures, which raises the prospect of discordant results between laboratories. This study compared the results obtained from MPS testing of ten diagnostic AML bone marrow aspirate samples sent to eight participating laboratories across Australasia. A reassuringly high concordance of 94% was observed with regard to variant detection and characterisation of pathogenicity. The level of discordance observed, although low, demonstrates the need for ongoing assessment of concordance between diagnostic testing laboratories through quality assurance programs.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is predominantly a disease of the elderly; the median age of incidence is 64 years, and 60% of all cases are over 60. With improved chemotherapy regimens and maximal supportive care, remission rates of up to 60% may be achieved in selected elderly patients. Whilst intensive chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for fit patients, it may be inappropriate for debilitated patients with poor prognosis disease in whom supportive care or palliative chemotherapy may be more suitable. AML in the elderly exhibits biological differences from AML in younger patients, and elderly patients may be unable to withstand the rigors of the intensive treatment regimens given to younger patients. We review methods to evaluate prognostic factors, the development and application of prognostic models, and available data regarding prognostic factors in elderly patients with AML. We discuss a rationale for the use of prognostic factors in selecting therapy for patients and for tailoring of therapy according to disease and host related variables.\n",
      "The case is reported of a 45 year old woman with the rare leukaemia of natural killer cell large granular lymphocyte (NK/ LGL) type. Cytometric analysis of leukaemic blasts showed that they were positive for CD2, CD38, and CD56 antigens but negative for a series of antigens including CD3, CD7, CD16, and HLA-DR. Rearrangements of the beta T cell receptor, and heavy and kappa immunoglobulin genes were not detected and neither were chromosomal abnormalities. Leukaemic blasts developed NK cytotoxicity. The patient failed to respond to aggressive chemotherapy and died three months after diagnosis. The lack of expression of HLA-DR is an extraordinary characteristic of this case, as all cases of acute NK cell leukaemias described to date expressed HLA-DR. The immunophenotype observed in the NK cell leukaemic blasts may represent the counterpart of a hypothetical normal cell precursor in an early stage of ontogenic NK cell development.\n",
      "While chemotherapy is successful at inducing remission of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the disease has a high probability of relapse. Strategies to prevent relapse involve consolidation chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation and immunotherapy. Evidence for immunosurveillance of AML and susceptibility of leukaemia cells to both T cell and natural killer (NK) cell attack and justifies the application of immune strategies to control residual AML persisting after remission induction. Immune therapy for AML includes allogeneic stem cell transplantation, adoptive transfer of allogeneic or autologous T cells or NK cells, vaccination with leukaemia cells, dendritic cells, cell lysates, peptides and DNA vaccines and treatment with cytokines, antibodies and immunomodulatory agents. Here we describe what is known about the immunological features of AML at presentation and in remission, the current status of immunotherapy and strategies combining treatment approaches with a view to achieving leukaemia cure.\n",
      "Fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with morphology (MGG/FISH) was used to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in complete remission (CR) in 12 cases of acute leukaemia (six MDS-AML, five de novo AML, one pre-B ALL) with numerical chromosomal aberrations at diagnosis. Residual leukaemic cells could be detected in the remission bone marrows by MGG/FISH in five patients, whereas the other seven showed no abnormalities. All five patients with signs of MRD at CR relapsed in the bone marrow with 2-9 months, in contrast to two of seven with a normal finding by MGG/FISH at CR. In both these patients a second MGG/FISH analysis showed that a subpopulation of leukaemic blasts had reappeared, 4 and 5 months prior to the leukaemia becoming clinically overt. One patient suffered a CNS relapse, but without any evidence of bone marrow involvement. The remaining four patients with no evidence of MRD at CR were still in haematological remission at follow-up after 4, 11, 12 and 13 months, respectively. We conclude that MGG/FISH seems to be a clinically useful method to detect MRD in acute leukaemia and to predict relapses, particularly when repeat studies are performed during CR.\n",
      "The roles of age and sex and their relationship to other prognostic factors were studied in 117 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and in 256 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients. Survival in CML was not related either to age at diagnosis or to sex. In contrast, the CLL patients classified into four age strata (less than 50, 50-59, 60-69, greater than 70 years) had an expected median survival (EMS) of 142, 101, 85 and 33 months respectively (chi 2 for heterogeneity = 35.59, P less than 0.0005; chi 2 for trend = 25.09, P less than 0.0005). Prognostic power was independent of sex, Rai stages, total tumour mass score (TTM), TTM distribution pattern, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, serum immunoglobulins and response to therapy. The relative survival rate (the ratio of patient EMS and EMS in age- and sex-matched general population) was 0.40 in CLL patients and 0.13 in CML patients. Relative survival was more reduced in older CLL patients than in younger ones (0.37 vs 0.47, respectively), whereas relative survival was less reduced in older CML patients than in younger ones (0.18 vs 0.12, respectively). The results show that the age is a significant independent prognostic factor in CLL but not in CML. The difference in the effects of age on prognosis in CLL and CML most probably reflects the fundamental differences in their respective pathogeneses.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a highly immuno- and myelo-suppressive conditioning regimen followed by the infusion of large numbers of T-cell-depleted mismatched haematopoietic stem cells in 43 high-risk acute leukaemia patients. RESULTS: A high rate of engraftment (95%) and no graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) were observed. The 4-year probability of event-free survival was 0.25+/-0.09 for acute myeloid leukaemia and 0.17+/-0.07 for acute lymphoid leukaemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the main obstacles limiting the use of mismatched transplants, i.e. GvHD and rejection, were overcome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have provided evidence that common genetic variations with low penetrance could account for a proportion of leukemia and could also influence disease outcome, although the results obtained are still controversial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 54 recent reports focused on the contribution of genetic polymorphisms to the risk of developing leukemia and to disease progression. The polymorphisms of genes encoding drug-metabolising enzymes (CYP family, NQO1, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1), enzymes involved in folate metabolism (MTHFR, TYMS, SHMT1, MTRR), and DNA repair enzymes (XPD, XPG, RAD51, XRCC1, XRCC3, CHEK2, ATM) were considered in the review. RESULTS: There was a good agreement on the influence of NQO1*2 polymorphism and those of the enzymes involved in DNA repair with the increased risk of therapy-related leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. Most studies found a strong association between the polymorphisms MTHFR, C677T or A1298C, and NQO1*2 or *3 and the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In addition, most of the studies reported an association between GSTT1 deletions and an increased risk of de novo acute myeloid leukemia. In ALL, polymorphisms in the genes of folate metabolism are associated with poor prognosis, and the 3R3R TYMS polymorphism in particular is associated with methotrexate resistance. CONCLUSION: The reports reviewed support the hypothesis that several low-penetrance genes with multiplicative effects together with dietary effects, ambient exposition, and individual immune system responses, may account for the risk of leukaemia.\n",
      "Haploinsufficiency of RUNX1/AML1 is associated with familial platelet disorder with a predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia (FPD/AML), but the causal relationship remains to be addressed experimentally. Mice heterozygous for the Runx1 null mutation, Runx1+/-, are considered to be genetically comparable with human FPD/AML patients but do not develop spontaneous leukaemia. To induce additional genetic alterations, retroviral insertional mutagenesis was employed with the use of BXH2 mice, which develop myeloid leukaemia because of the random integration of retrovirus present in the mouse. Heterozygous disruption of Runx1 in BXH2 mice resulted in a shortening of the latency period of leukaemia. In addition, BXH2-Runx1+/- mice exhibited more marked myeloid features than control mice. Moreover, the c-Kit gene, mutated in human RUNX leukaemias, was recurrently activated in BXH2-Runx1+/- mice, and a colony-forming assay revealed synergism between the Runx1+/- status and c-KIT overexpression. In conclusion, the BXH2-Runx1+/- system is a promising mouse model to investigate the mechanism of leukaemogenesis in FPD/AML.\n",
      "This qualitative study examines the experience of haematological cancer as described by ten people who have been through leukaemia or lymphoma and a bone marrow transplant. The focus is on the interaction of these participants with this challenging experience and the meaning it had for them. The descriptions of their thoughts, feelings and actions as they negotiated the period from diagnosis to treatment and survival reveal that these people brought both the present values in their life, as well as a life-long pattern of dealing with adversity, into their confrontation of a life-threatening illness. Issues of personal meaning and agency (the capacity to act and control valued aspects of one life) were found to be paramount. These results are then discussed with a view to their implications for patient care.\n",
      "Alkyl-lysophospholipids (ALPs) are reported to have an antineoplastic activity against leukaemic cells. We have tested some halogen-containing ALPs from the Central Institute of Molecular Biology (H. Brachwitz) in comparison with racemic 1-ostadecyl-2-methyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH3) (P.G. Munder, Max-Planck-Institut für Immunobiologie, Freiburg, FRG). We found freshly dissolved ALPs to be very toxic both to human bone marrow and to leukaemic cells of patients. ALP-incubation before cryopreservation is more toxic to bone marrow (but not to AML blasts) than after cryopreservation. All experiments to test the selectivity and to establish a purging protocol should be done using 1, remission marrow including a cryopreservation step and 2, blasts of de novo leukaemias instead of cell as sensitive as HL 60 to ALP-incubation. We found direct toxicity of ALPs to be not suitable for purging lines of bone marrow from patients in remission.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between parental employment in the nuclear industry and childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING-West Berkshire and Basingstoke and North Hampshire District Health Authorities. SUBJECTS: 54 children aged 0-4 years who had leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed during 1972-89, who were born in the study area and were resident there when cancer was diagnosed. Six controls were selected for each case: four from hospital delivery registers and two from livebirth registers maintained by the NHS central register. Controls were matched for sex, date of birth (within six months), and area of residence at birth and time of diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parents' employment by the nuclear industry and exposure to ionising radiation at work. RESULTS: Five (9%) of the 54 cases and 14 (4%) of the 324 controls had fathers or mothers, or both, who had been employed by the nuclear industry (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 6.9). Nuclear industry employees who work in areas where exposure to radiation is possible are given film badges to monitor their exposure to external penetrating ionising radiation. Three fathers of cases and two fathers of controls (and no mothers of either) had been monitored in this way before their child was conceived (relative risk 9.0, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 107.8). No father (of a case or control) had accumulated a recorded dose of more than 5 mSv before his child was conceived, and no father had been monitored at any time in the four years before his child was conceived. A dose-response relation was not evident among fathers who had been monitored. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the children of fathers who had been monitored for exposure to external penetrating ionising radiation in the nuclear industry may be at increased risk of developing leukaemia before their fifth birthday. The finding is based on small numbers and could be due to chance. If the relationship is real the mechanisms are far from clear, except that the effect is unlikely to be due to external radiation; the possibility that it could be due to internal contamination by radioactive substances or some other exposure at work should be pursued. The above average rates of leukaemia in the study area cannot be accounted for by these findings.\n",
      "Transcription factors play a central role in the pathogenesis of acute leukaemia. Genes encoding transcription factors are frequently perturbed by chromosome rearrangements. More recently acquired point mutations have been described in a number of important genes for normal haematopoiesis. The stem cell leukaemia (SCL) gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor and is upregulated by chromosome rearrangements in T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. SCL function is essential for the development of both primitive and definitive haematopoiesis. We searched for SCL mutations in myeloid leukaemias and chronic myeloproliferative disorders. Our data demonstrated that SCL point mutations were rare in acute myeloid leukaemia and myeloproliferative disorders.\n",
      "Clinician-parent communication may often be difficult, especially soon after the diagnosis. The aims of this article are to identify the communication strategies associated with expressions of adaptive emotions in parents and to explore the effect of the type of leukemia and of parent gender on parents' expressions of emotions. The data are obtained from 4.622 conversational turns of 20 videotaped interviews with 10 mothers and 10 fathers of children at their first hospitalization for leukemia. A coding scheme for parent emotional expressions was reliably applied by two independent judges. An original self-report questionnaire on parents' emotional states was used before and after the interview. Positive politeness of interviewer elicits adaptive emotional expressions in parents. Mothers of children with acute myeloid leukemia and fathers of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia appear more distressed during the interview. This interview can be identified as an innovative technique of communication with parents of children with cancer.\n",
      "Although there is widespread agreement that many cancers have environmental causes we are often unable to see associations between specific cancers and exposure to environmental chemicals. One might also speculate that the more widespread, common-place and 'normal' a chemical exposure is perceived to be then the less likely it will be that the exposure is recognised, let alone be considered to cause cancer. Widespread contamination of air by chemicals associated with internal combustion may be an example of one such 'invisible' carcinogenic exposure. Yet evidence is available which suggests that many leukaemia and lymphoma cases, as well as other cancers, may be caused by this mundane and ubiquitous environmental contamination. The hypothesis is developed that leukaemia 'clustering' as well as national leukaemia incidence may be related to non-occupational exposure to benzene formed by petrol combustion and resulting from petrol evaporation. The possible association between exposure to fuel vapours, internal combustion products and cancer merits much closer examination than it receives at present.\n",
      "It has been 12 years since the simultaneous discovery of the unique sensitivity of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) to differentiation therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and the discovery that the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) gene was rearranged in APL. Nearly 98% of cases of APL are associated with t(15;17) chromosomal translocation and fusion of the PML gene to that encoding RARalpha to yield an abnormal receptor with the capability of de-regulating gene expression in the haematopoietic cell, causing differentiation block and eventually the development of leukaemia. Since this original discovery, four other translocations were described in APL. In each of these the RARalpha gene is fused to different partner genes, all yielding aberrant nuclear receptors. These fusion proteins share in common the ability to repress rather than activate retinoic acid targets, one so strongly that the result is an ATRA-resistant form of the disease. In addition each of the partner proteins is important for normal cell growth and development. In this chapter we explore the biology of the RARalpha, the fusion proteins created in APL and the normal forms of the partner proteins. Through continued study of this disease it is hoped that novel treatments, potentially more applicable to other forms of leukaemia, may arise.\n",
      "Over the last four decades the survival of paediatric patients with acute myeloid leukaemia has gradually increased to 70% in high-income countries. The therapy is very intensive and associated with many acute and long-term side effects. The early death rate has been reduced to 1-4%. The acute toxicity is a limiting factor for improving survival in low-income countries. Transplant is associated with more endocrinological late effects while cardiotoxicity is more common after relapse. Reducing the physical costs of therapy without jeopardizing survival may be accomplished by optimal supportive care, less cardiotoxic anthracyclines, less consolidation courses and strict indications for stem cell transplantation. Analysing scenarios with different frequency of transplantation in first complete remission show similar overall survival rates, indicating that almost all patients can be spared the procedure in first remission. Reducing relapse risk is an effective way of reducing toxicity and more targeted therapy and improved risk group stratifications are needed.\n",
      "The Gly71Arg mutation of the hepatic bilirubin UDP glucuronosyl-transferase (B-UGT) gene associated with Gilbert syndrome prevails among Japanese and its gene frequency is 0.13. Among 20 patients with acute leukaemia, 4 patients showed intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia during the course of combined chemotherapy. The Gly71Arg mutation was detected in all 4 patients with hyperbilirubinaemia, but was not found in 16 patients without hyperbilirubinaemia. Two of them were heterozygotes and one was a homozygote for the Gly71Arg mutation, and the other was a compound heterozygote of the Gly71Arg mutation and TA insertion mutation in the TATA box of the B-UGT gene. In addition to the complications leading to hyperbilirubinaemia, including liver damage due to drugs, viral infections or tumour cell infiltrations and alloimmune haemolysis, carrier status for the Gly71Arg mutation should be considered in a patient with leukaemia showing intermittent hyperbilirubinaemia during the course of chemotherapy, especially among Japanese, Koreans and Chinese owing to its prevalence in those populations.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to formally investigate the onset of the Seascale cluster of childhood and young person cancer. This has not previously been attempted. METHODS: A mortality study within the Whitehaven registration district was set up and death records were abstracted for 1906-1970. They were categorized as death from leukaemias, lymphomas, other cancers and all other causes in persons aged 0-14, 0-24 and 25-84. The number of deaths, death rates and standardized mortality ratios were calculated. RESULTS: The mortality of persons aged 25-84 in Seascale civil parish, Gosforth civil parish and the rest of the Whitehaven district was unremarkable compared with national data 1906-1970. There were no cancer deaths aged 0-24 in Gosforth civil parish during 1906-1970. In Seascale civil parish a hitherto unrecorded childhood cancer case was revealed, dying in 1954. No cancer deaths aged 0-24 were found before that date. In the period 1946-1955 three cancer deaths gave a statistically significant excess owing to non-leukaemia cases, whereas in the period 1956-1965 a statistical excess of all types of leukaemia occurred as a result of two deaths. There was no case excess (based on one leukaemia death) in the period 1966-1970. CONCLUSION: We found no clear temporal associations of the case excesses either with the periods of significant nuclear activity on the Sellafield site or with the main periods of population growth in the area.\n",
      "Aggressive natural killer-cell leukaemia is a rare aggressive form of natural killer-cell neoplasm. We report a case of a 40-year-old male who presented with jaundice, raised blood counts,generalised lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis was established by flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow aspirate. The patient, however, succumbed to his illness within 2 weeks of starting chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the third reported case from India.\n",
      "We report a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia (Philadelphia-positive with M-BCR rearrangement) in transformation whose blast cells had myelomonocytic morphology, absent terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase expression and non-lymphoid cell surface markers (CD10-, CD19-, CD33+, CD14+, CD11+). Leukaemia cell DNA showed rearrangement of both immunoglobulin heavy chain and T-cell receptor delta genes. Such rearrangements may be a feature of a small proportion of patients with non-lymphoid transformation of CML as they are in a minority of cases of de novo acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n",
      "Recurrent reciprocal chromosomal translocations are frequently found in leukaemias and sarcomas as initiating events in these cancers. Mouse models of chromosomal translocations are not only important for the elucidation of the mechanism of these factors underlying the disease but are also important pre-clinical models for assessing new drug combinations, developing new rational therapeutic strategies based on new drugs and testing novel macromolecular drugs. We describe three technologies for creating chromosomal translocation mimics in mice, applied specifically to understand how the MLL-fusions contribute to leukaemia. An important finding of this work is that the lineage of the tumours can be controlled by the MLL-protein fusion. The translocation mimic methods can be applied to any human reciprocal chromosomal translocation.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Previous reports have indicated that the short term prognosis for patients with malignant diseases and serious adverse events requiring mechanical ventilation (SAEV) is improving. The purpose of this study was to determine whether these patients can be cured of malignant disease or whether they survive SAEV only to subsequently relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors report the outcome of children with SAEV treated in the multicentre studies ALL-BFM 95 and AML-BFM 98. Data from 1182 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 334 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were analysed. 88 patients (51 ALL and 37 AML) developed SAEV. RESULTS: The prognosis was almost identical in ALL and AML patients (survival of SAEV patients: 48%, 95% CI 38% to 58%; overall survival after 5 years: 31%, 95% CI 21% to 41%). Prognosis was independent of the time between leukaemia diagnosis and SAEV. Approximately 20% of children who required haemodialysis (n=14) or cardiac resuscitation (n=16) achieved long term survival, but no patient who fulfilled more than three of six identified risk factors (age ≥10 years, high risk leukaemia, C reactive protein ≥150 mg/l, administration of inotropic infusion, cardiac resuscitation and haemodialysis) survived (n=16; 0%, 95% CI 0% to 20%). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive care improves the short and long term survival of children with leukaemia. 64% (95% CI 50% to 78%) of children with acute leukaemia who survived SAEV achieved long term survival. Prognosis mainly depends on age and leukaemia risk group.\n",
      "Myeloid leukaemias share the common characteristics of being stem cell-derived clonal diseases, characterised by excessive proliferation of one or more myeloid lineage. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) arises from a genetic alteration in a normal haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) giving rise to a leukaemic stem cell (LSC) within the bone marrow (BM) 'niche'. CML is characterised by the presence of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase fusion protein breakpoint cluster region-abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR-ABL), which is responsible for driving the disease through activation of downstream signal transduction pathways. Recent evidence from our group and others indicates that important regulatory networks involved in establishing primitive and definitive haemopoiesis during development are reactivated in myeloid leukaemia, giving rise to an LSC population with altered self-renewal and differentiation properties. In this review, we explore the role the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling plays in stem cell pluripotency, developmental haemopoiesis, HSC maintenance and the implication of altered BMP signalling on LSC persistence in the BM niche. Overall, we emphasise how the BMP and Wnt pathways converge to alter the Cdx-Hox axis and the implications of this in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies.\n",
      "Most chromosomal abnormalities associated with breakage at 11q23 in acute leukaemia involve the MLL gene, and the presence of this breakage strongly predicts a poor clinical outcome. We assessed the possibility of differentiation-inducing therapy for acute leukaemias with chromosomal translocations involving 11q23. Among the cell lines with MLL translocations that we examined, KOCL48 and KOPN-1 cells were induced to differentiate into granulocytes by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or into monocytes by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3). These cells expressed p16 mRNA before treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), an inhibitor of DNA methylation. On the other hand, differentiation was not induced in SN-1, KOCL33, KOCL51 or KOCL44 cells by ATRA or VD3, and these cells did not express mRNA of this gene. However, these cells were effectively induced to differentiate by ATRA or VD3 in the presence of 5-AZA, and concomitantly exhibited p16 gene expression, suggesting an association between DNA demethylation and restoration of sensitivity to differentiation-inducing activity of ATRA or VD3 in leukaemia cells with MLL abnormalities. Based on these findings, combined treatment with ATRA or VD3 plus 5-AZA may be clinically useful in therapy for acute leukaemia with MLL abnormalities.\n",
      "The incidence and mortality of bleeding complications have been investigated in 438 patients with acute leukaemia consolidated either by chemotherapy (n = 241) or by bone marrow transplantation (n = 197). Bleeding signs on admission were found in 38% of the chemotherapy-treated group. Haemorrhagic deaths during the 1st month were seen in 10%. The majority of the major bleedings were localized intracranial, but gastrointestinal haemorrhages were also common. The platelet count was significantly lower (40 x 10(9)/l versus 69 x 10(9)/l, p < 0.001) and the leukocyte count significantly higher (31.2 x 10(9)/l versus 11.6 x 10(9)/l, p < 0.001) in the group with bleeding complications than in those without. The haemorrhagic mortality in patients consolidated with chemotherapy compared with transplant patients was similar, 23% and 19%. The majority of the lethal haemorrhages in the latter group were observed in patients undergoing allogenic bone marrow transplantation after engraftment. Septicaemia, graft-versus-host and venous occlusive disease were contributing factors.\n",
      "This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) gene mutations in the World Health Organization classified subtypes of acute leukaemia (AL), and their prognostic significance in terms of complete remission (CR), leukaemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). Of 468 patients, 374 (79.9%) had acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 83 (17.7%) had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Among the AML patients, a FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutation was present in 59 cases (15.8%), whereas a FLT3/D835 mutation was detected in 15 cases (4.0%). Conversely, in the ALL patients, no FLT3/ITD mutations were detected and a FLT3/D835 mutation was found in only two cases (2.4%). The FLT3/ITD mutation was associated with a lower CR rate compared with those with no mutations (52.3% versus 71.1%) and with a shorter median OS (9 versus 18 months) in AML patients. In conclusion, the FLT3/ITD mutation occurred frequently in AML and was associated with a lower CR and shorter median OS. In contrast, FLT3/D835 mutations were not of prognostic value.\n",
      "Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels were quantitated in leukaemic blast cells separated from peripheral blood of 15 children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and of 6 children with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). Using a whole-cell assay, it was found that specific (3H)-dexamethasone binding exhibited a wide range in both types of acute leukaemia: GR levels scattered between 0-22,346/cell and 0-8772/cell in ALL and ANLL patients, respectively. In this paper we discuss our observations together with current knowledge on GR levels in leukaemic blast cells and their relationship to glucocorticoid sensitivity and disease outcome.\n",
      "The ability of cancer cells to become simultaneously resistant to different drugs is a significant impediment to successful chemotherapy. 99mTc-MIBI has been reported to be a transport substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp). The aim of the study was to ascertain the relationship between the degree of 99mTc-MIBI uptake and the level of Pgp expression in patients with newly diagnosed leukaemia. A total of 26 patients (12 female and 14 male; mean age 46.8+/-3.7 years) with newly diagnosed leukaemia were included in the study. None of the patients had been previously treated with chemotherapy. Images were obtained 20 min post-injection of 740 MBq 99mTc-MIBI. Whole-body and planar spot images of the pelvis and thorax were acquired. The uptake of the MIBI in the bone marrow was evaluated using a qualitative and also a quantitative scoring system with determination of the tumour-to-background (T/B) ratios. Flow cytometry was performed for determining the Pgp expression of the blast cells in the bone marrow aspiration samples. There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between the Pgp level in numeric values and both mean qualitative (P<0.001; r=-0.665) and quantitative (P=0.001; r=-0.606) results of 99mTc-MIBI imaging. Both the mean qualitative score and the T/B ratios were higher in patients who were Pgp negative than in those who were Pgp positive (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). These data indicate that an increased level of Pgp expression is correlated with a low accumulation of 99mTc-MIBI in bone marrow of patients with leukaemia. 99mTc-MIBI bone marrow imaging, as a method of functional imaging, can give in vivo information concerning the functional expression of the MDR phenotype in patients with untreated leukaemia.\n",
      "In patients with acute leukaemia, the relative risk of relapse influences the choice between chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The demonstration that minimal residual disease (MRD) is the strongest overall prognostic indicator and can identify patients who are unlikely to be cured by standard chemotherapy has added a powerful new factor to consider when making this decision. There is substantial data indicating that the likelihood of relapse after transplant is directly correlated with levels of MRD before transplant. This knowledge can be used to adjust the timing of HSCT, and guide the selection of donor, conditioning regimen, and post-HSCT strategies to maximize the graft-versus-leukaemia effect. Because MRD emerging post-transplant carries a dire prognosis, its detection can trigger withdrawal of immunosuppression, additional cellular and molecular therapies, or preparations for a second HSCT. Although it is not yet clear whether any of these actions will significantly improve outcome, it is likely that they will be most effective for patients with a relatively low tumour burden, who can be identified only through MRD testing. In this article, we review the clinical significance of MRD in the context of autologous and allogeneic HSCT.\n",
      "The Technicon H*1 haematology system is provided with a new method for basophil count, neutrophil lobularity assessment and detection of blasts in peripheral blood through automated measurement of nuclear density. We compared the results of the H*1 blast flag with those of the microscope examination in 131 peripheral blood samples from 43 patients with acute leukaemia in different phases of their disease, to determine the degree of sensitivity and specificity of the system in this setting. In six patients at diagnosis or in overt relapse, all having large percentages of blasts at the manual differential count, a typical deformation of the profile of the mononuclear cell population on the display was consistently observed, regardless of the morphological subtype of leukaemic cell which was involved. Amongst 34 samples with 4-95% morphologically recognizable blasts on the peripheral blood film, the sensitivity of the system was 100% with no false negatives at all. In 43 samples, on the other hand, the H*1 blast flag was positive in the absence of any morphological evidence of blasts on the smear. These 'false positives', however, were always obtained from leucopenic patients who had more than 12% blast infiltration in the bone marrow, compared to the 0-6% value that was found in patients with a negative H*1 blast flag. These results suggest that the H*1 system is a highly sensitive tool for the detection in peripheral blood of even small concentration of leukaemic cells, which escape morphological identification.\n",
      "Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes provide extremely useful genetic models for understanding leukaemogenesis because the initial genetic defect can be identified and the risk of leukaemia is very high. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is one of the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndromes and an example of such a model. Here, I describe the malignant features of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and discuss the potential molecular mechanisms that can lead to leukaemia.\n",
      "Unrelated donor (UD) transplantation is the only potentially curative therapy for many leukaemia patients but is associated with a high mortality and morbidity. We sought to identify factors that could be optimised to improve outcome following UD transplantation in adults. Data was retrospectively analysed on 55 patients sequentially receiving UD transplants for CML or acute leukaemia (AL), all of whom received serotherapy for the prevention of GVHD and rejection. All patients received standard conditioning regimens. The first 28 patients transplanted also received combined pre- and post-transplant serotherapy with Campath 1G (days -5 to +5) and standard dose CsA plus MTX as GVHD prophylaxis (protocol 1). The subsequent 27 patients received a 5-day course of pre-transplant serotherapy alone either with ATG (CML patients) or Campath 1G (AL patients) on days -5 to -1 inclusive, with high-dose CSA plus MTX (protocol 2). The incidence of acute GVHD was low with no patient receiving either protocol developing > grade 2 disease. The use of protocol 2 and the administration of a bone marrow cell dose above the median (2.17 x 10(8)/kg) were the most important factors predicting engraftment (P = 0.03 and P = 0.001, respectively) but this only remained significant for cell dose in multivariate analysis (P = 0.03). Overall survival for the group was 45% at 3 years and was influenced by both age (P = 0.02) and disease status at transplantation (P = 0.001). Receiving a cell dose above the median was also associated with a trend towards better survival (P = 0.08), due primarily to a reduction in the TRM to 8.2% compared with 54.5% in those receiving a lower cell dose (P = 0.002). We conclude that pre-transplant serotherapy alone is highly effective at preventing acute GVHD following UD BMT and that additional post-transplant serotherapy does not confer any benefit. Furthermore, a high marrow cell dose infused has a major effect in reducing transplant related mortality following UD BMT.\n",
      "A small but important proportion of patients with myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute leukaemia (AL) have underlying germline mutations in leukaemia susceptibility genes. The majority of these variants predispose to myeloid neoplasms with a smaller number associated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The 2016 revision of the WHO classification of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues has defined a number of myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition (Blood, 127, 2016, 2391) alerting clinicians to the importance of this underlying diagnosis. Advances in genetic technology and access to testing will undoubtably result in increased numbers of patients and families with leukaemia predisposition syndromes being identified. Here we summarize the salient biology and genetic and clinical features of a number of these conditions including some more recently described genetic variants.\n",
      "We report a rare occurrence of myeloid sarcoma in a 7 years old child with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML-FAB type M2). He presented with fever, generalized weakness, bilateral proptosis and left parotid swelling. CT scan revealed a mass in paranasal sinuses extending into brain and retro-orbital region. Diagnosis of AML M2 was made on bone marrow aspiration and special stains. Induction therapy for AML was given according to standard protocol. The extramedullary lesion as well as the acute leukaemia went into complete remission.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor α (TGFα) is a peptide growth factor known to be expressed in normal haemopoiesis. It is also expressed in a range of epithelial neoplasms but has not been assessed in haemopoietic malignancies. We have performed an immunohistochemical evaluation of TGFα in acute and chronic myeloid malignancies. METHODS: TGFα expression was semiquantitatively assessed in 69 normal bone marrow trephines and 157 cases of myeloid malignancy using an immunohistochemical approach. RESULTS: Blast cells of myeloid origin in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), myelodysplasia and accelerated and blast phases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) were TGFα positive. In acute promyelocytic leukaemia the neoplastic cells had significantly weaker TGFα expression than seen in other forms of AML. The blast cells in CML-accelerated and blast phases were positive with similar expression to AML. CONCLUSIONS: TGFα is expressed in neoplastic myeloblasts and could, therefore, be used as blast cell biomarker in diagnostic haematopathology. In addition, TGFα immunohistochemistry may be of use in identifying a therapeutic target.\n",
      "Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) had emerged as promising drugs in leukaemia, but their toxicity due to lack of specificity limited their use. Therefore, there is a need to elucidate the role of HDACs in specific settings. The study of HDAC expression in childhood leukaemia could help to choose more specific HDACi for selected candidates in a personalized approach. We analysed HDAC1-11, SIRT1, SIRT7, MEF2C and MEF2D mRNA expression in 211 paediatric patients diagnosed with acute leukaemia. There was a global overexpression of HDACs, while specific HDACs correlated with clinical and biological features, and some even predicted outcome. Thus, some HDAC and MEF2C profiles probably reflected the lineage and the maturation of the blasts and some profiles identified specific oncogenic pathways active in the leukaemic cells. Specifically, we identified a distinctive signature for patients with KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement, with high HDAC9 and MEF2D expression, regardless of age, KMT2A partner and lineage. Moreover, we observed an adverse prognostic value of HDAC9 overexpression, regardless of KMT2A rearrangement. Our results provide useful knowledge on the complex picture of HDAC expression in childhood leukaemia and support the directed use of specific HDACi to selected paediatric patients with acute leukaemia.\n",
      "The morphology, membrane markers and ultrastructural cytochemistry of 39 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with variable proportion (10-99%) of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) positive blasts was compared with that of 134 cases of TdT negative AML. The incidence of TdT positive AML was 22.5% and this was significantly higher in poorly differentiated myeloblastic (M0 and M1) types (54%) than in all other FAB subtypes (10%; P less than 0.001). Our findings suggest heterogeneity among TdT positive cases. Whilst the majority correspond to genuine TdT positive AML in which evidence for exclusive myeloid nature was demonstrated by phenotypic, cytochemical and ultrastructural markers, a distinct minority (22%) of cases had mixtures of lymphoid and myeloid blasts. A change in phenotype occurred in three out of six cases studied in relapse. There was no difference in the incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement between TdT positive (two out of 12) and TdT negative (one out of 11) cases, although published data suggests that Ig gene rearrangement is significantly more common in TdT positive cases. The determination of TdT in AML allows the identification of cases of mixed acute leukaemia which probably represent proliferations of multipotent progenitor cells. The majority of TdT positive cases, nevertheless, correspond to immature types of myeloblastic leukaemia which may constitute a clinically distinct subgroup.\n",
      "A 5-year-old Thoroughbred mare presented with a 4 week history of weight loss, fever and leukopenia. Rectally, a large active foetus, thickened spleen and an abdominal mass were palpated. Leukopenia, mild anaemia, marked thrombocytopenia and hyperfibrinogenaemia were found. Cytology and cytochemical staining of a bone marrow aspirate supported a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The mare deteriorated despite medical therapy and was humanely euthanased.\n",
      "The recurrence of leukaemia following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation appears to develop rarely in donor cells. However, the standard method for assigning the origin of recurrence, metaphase analysis, can be unreliable. We have applied the technique of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) directly on archival Wright stained bone marrow slides obtained from a patient who developed acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). Using a chromosome-specific DNA probe we linked a chromosomal aberration, previously detected by conventional metaphase analysis, directly to morphologically identifiable blast cells. In this way we were able to assess cell-lineage involvement of the secondary leukaemia and assign a donor origin.\n",
      "Most methods used in double esterase cytochemistry for the diagnosis and classification of acute myeloid leukaemias require double incubation and staining, using separate coupling reagents. We evaluated a method by Swirsky on our normal and abnormal blood and bone marrow smears where only a single incubation and the use of a single coupling reagent is required. Its short incubation period and its strong positive reaction for butyrate esterase in demonstrating cells of monocytic lineage gives it an advantage over the conventional double incubation technique.\n",
      "The curability of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in a fraction of adult patients was demonstrated a long time ago. Currently, the probability of cure is consistently above fifty per cent in patients with de novo disease expressing favourable-risk associated cytogenetic features. Even better, the cure rate exceeds 75% in the acute promyelocytic subtype since the introduction of retinoic acid-containing regimens. In the meantime, continuing progress in supportive care systems and stem cell transplant procedures is making myeloablative therapies, when needed, somewhat less toxic-and thereby more effective-than in the recent past. Therefore, evidence is accumulating to indicate an improved therapeutic trend over the years, with the notable exception of older (>55 years) patients with adverse-risk chromosomal aberrations and/or leukemia secondary to myelodysplasia or prior cancer-related chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. This review conveys the many facets of this progress, focusing on diagnostic subsets, risk classes, newer biological issues and conventional as well as innovative therapeutic interventions with or without autologous/allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) arising in irradiated CBA/H mice frequently have breakpoints in the F region of chromosome 2. The closely linked cytokine genes interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and beta map to this region, and the beta gene is deregulated in some AMLs. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis techniques, we show here that an 800 kb 2F region encoding IL-1 alpha and beta is not obviously rearranged in six leukaemias carrying chromosome 2 abnormalities. However, changes in IL-1 region DNA methylation in three leukaemias may be consistent with loss of hypermethylated sequences from one chromosome copy. These possible 2F region losses are discussed in relation to genomic imprinting and its potential role in murine myeloid leukaemogenesis.\n",
      "Summary NSC290205 (A) is an hybrid synthetic antineoplastic ester that is a combination of a d-lactam derivative of androsterone and an alkylating derivative of N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)aniline. We tested NSC290205 for synergistic antileukaemic activity with adriamycin (ADR), (i) in vitro against the human lymphoid leukaemia cell lines: CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4, and RPMI-8226, (ii) in vivo against P388 lymphocytic and L1210 lymphoid murine leukaemias (at incipient and advanced phase). Our results indicated significant cytostatic and cytotoxic synergy of NSC290205 and ADR in vitro. We further examined these results in vivo by replacing cyclophosphamide in the standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, Oncovin, prednisone) regimen with NSC290205 (AHOP) and comparing the efficiency of these two regimens in vivo. Although treatment of P388 and L1210 with cyclophosphamide or NSC290205 alone yielded equivalent results, AHOP produced a clear benefit for survival compared with CHOP against advanced leukaemias, confirming the in vitro observations [higher percentage increase in median lifespan of treated animals over the untreated (control): 188% and 239% in L1210, 308% and 353% in P388, P < 0.01, for CHOP and AHOP respectively]. AHOP also proved to be more genotoxic and cytostatic than CHOP, inducing higher sister chromatid exchange levels and cell division delays on P388 cells in vivo. NSC290205 showed superior antineoplastic potential against lymphoid leukaemia and significant synergy with ADR, producing an excellent therapeutic outcome.\n",
      "Blood plasma interferon (IFN) of patients with acute myeloid (AML) and chronic granulocytic (CGL) and with acute and chronic lymphoid leukaemia (ALL and CLL) was measured by bioassay and characterized by neutralization with anti-human-IFN-alpha treatment. Elevated IFN-alpha level (60-125 IU/ml) was found in the quiescent phase of CGL as compared to the control samples (15 +/- 10 IU/ml). No significant differences could be found between plasma IFN of patients suffering from the blastic crisis of CGL and control persons. Analogous results were obtained in experiments with plasmas of AML patients, regardless the stage of the disease. Elevated IFN-alpha production (60-100 IU/ml) was found in patients being in the remission phase of T-cell ALL but only in one case in the progressive phase of the disease. No significant elevation of plasma IFN level was demonstrated in patients with O-cell ALL and B-cell CLL, as compared to the control samples.\n",
      "The exact contribution of growth hormone (GH) deficiency to the adverse growth outcome, in those receiving cranial irradiation (18-24 Gy) or total-body irradiation for haematological malignancies in childhood, remains difficult to disentangle as nearly always the cause of the growth disturbance is multifactorial: chemotherapy, graft-versus-host disease, hypothyroidism, and skeletal dysplasia may all impact on growth. There are few published data from which one can assess the efficacy of GH replacement on final height in those children who received cranial irradiation (18-24 Gy) and/or total-body irradiation; there is no evidence, however, of an increased risk of leukaemic relapse. Endocrine reassessment in the teenagers, who received cranial irradiation (18-24 Gy) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia many years earlier, revealed a significant incidence of GH deficiency with the additional suggestion that many had been GH deficient for several years. This raises a number of important questions: What is the best way to organize long-term endocrine follow-up? How often should GH status be reassessed? What are the specific benefits of GH replacement in adult life for such individuals? These and other questions require further study.\n",
      "Although acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has long been recognized for its morphological and cytogenetic heterogeneity, recent high-resolution genomic profiling has demonstrated a complexity even greater than previously imagined. This complexity can be seen in the number and diversity of genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and characteristics of the leukaemic stem cells. The broad range of abnormalities across different AML subtypes suggests that improvements in clinical outcome will require the development of targeted therapies for each subtype of disease and the design of novel clinical trials to test these strategies. It is highly unlikely that further gains in long-term survival rates will be possible by mere intensification of conventional chemotherapy. In this review, we summarize recent studies that provide new insight into the genetics and biology of AML, discuss risk stratification and therapy for this disease, and profile some of the therapeutic agents currently under investigation.\n",
      "A new monoclonal antibody, KP1, against the CD68 antigen, which labels macrophages and other members of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage in routinely processed tissue sections, has been used to stain a range of lymphoid, histiocytic, and myelomonocytic proliferations. All 20 neoplasms of myeloid, myelomonocytic, and presumed macrophage derivation reacted with antibody KP1. None of the 22 cases of T cell neoplasia had positive reactions. Although 14 of 41 B lineage lymphomas and leukaemias were stained by antibody KP1, staining was usually confined to small dots of reactivity, in contrast to the strong and extensive cytoplasmic staining seen in the neoplasms of myeloid and macrophage/monocyte origin. Furthermore, positive B cell neoplasms were almost all small cell proliferations, which are unlikely to be confused with myelomonocytic malignancies. It was concluded that antibody KP1 is a valuable addition to a panel of monoclonal antibodies for phenotyping lymphomas, particularly in routinely fixed tissues. It should assist the pathologist in the recognition of extramedullary presentation of leukaemia, aid in the diagnosis of suspected cases of true histiocytic neoplasia, and allow for quantitation of macrophages infiltrating lymphomas and other solid tumors.\n",
      "Bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens from 24 patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia were studied to identify bone marrow changes that suggest incipient or impending blast transformation. In the chronic phase of chronic granulocytic leukaemia, blasts and promyelocytes were seen predominantly in the paratrabecular and perivascular regions, while myelocytes, metamyelocytes and segmented polymorphs were seen predominantly in the central intertrabecular marrow space. The patients were divided into two equal groups according to the degree of perivascular and paratrabecular infiltration: those with minimal (one to three layers of blasts and promyelocytes) and those with marked (four to eight layers of blasts and promyelocytes) infiltration. Ten of the 12 patients in the former group did not develop blast transformation and remained in the chronic phase during a 32- to 84-week follow-up period, whereas nine of the 12 patients in the latter group developed blast transformation, with six undergoing transformation within the first 26 weeks. These findings suggest that the histomorphological pattern of bone marrow changes in chronic granulocytic leukaemia may be useful in recognizing a subset of chronic granulocytic leukaemia patients undergoing blast transformation in the ensuing 6 months.\n",
      "Adiponectin, an adipocyte-specific secretory protein known to induce apoptosis, has been reported to be inversely related to breast and endometrial cancers and recently found to inhibit proliferation of myeloid but not lymphoid cell lines. We hypothesised that adiponectin may be inversely associated with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), but not with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia of B (ALL-B) or T (ALL-T) cell origin in children. Blood samples and clinical information were collected over the period 1996-2000 from 201 children (0-14 years old) with leukaemia (22 AML, 161 ALL-B and 18 ALL-T cases) through a national network of childhood Hematology-Oncology units in Greece and from 201 controls hospitalised for minor pediatric ailments. Serum adiponectin levels were measured under code, at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA using a radioimmunoassay procedure. Each of the three leukaemia groups was compared with the control group through multiple logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for an increase of adiponectin equal to 1 s.d. among controls were estimated controlling for gender, age, as well as for height and weight, expressed in age-gender-specific centiles of Greek growth curves. Adiponectin was inversely associated with AML (OR=0.56; 95% CI, 0.34-0.94), whereas it was not significantly associated with either ALL-B (OR=0.88; 95% CI, 0.71-1.10) or ALL-T (OR=1.08; 95% CI, 0.67-1.72). Biological plausibility and empirical evidence point to the importance of this hormone in the pathogenesis of childhood AML.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Acute leukemia (AL) occurring in pregnancy is extremely rare, and its treatment is a clinical dilemma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of our hospital from 2010 to 2019. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were diagnosed with AL during pregnancy. Of whom, eighteen had acute myeloid leukemia, and 3 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Six, eight and seven patients were diagnosed during the first, second, and third trimester, respectively. Six of the 21 patients experienced therapeutic abortion and 1 had spontaneous abortion, whereas 9 gave birth to healthy babies (4 through vaginal deliveries and 5 with Caesarean sections). Four babies had been exposed to chemotherapeutic agents, but no congenital malformations were observed. Sixteen patients received chemotherapy, while 4 patients died before chemotherapy and one was discharged after refusing chemotherapy. The complete remission rate of the 10 patients who began chemotherapy immediately after diagnosis was 80%, compared with 66.7% in the 6 patients who started chemotherapy after abortion or delivery. Three remain alive. CONCLUSIONS: In general, initiation of chemotherapy as early as possible may increase the CR rate. Combined with literature data, we proposed that, for patients diagnosed in early and late stages of pregnancy (>30 weeks), elective termination or induced delivery before chemotherapy may be a good choice for better maternal (and fetal) outcome.KEY MESSAGESAcute leukaemia diagnosed in pregnancy is extremely rare, and its treatment is a clinical dilemma.In general, initiation of chemotherapy as early as possible may increase the CR rate.For patients who are diagnosed in the first trimester or late stage of pregnancy (>30 weeks), elective termination or induced delivery before starting chemotherapy may be a good choice for better maternal (and fetal) outcome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukaemia not responsive to first induction chemotherapy (PIF-AML) still remains a challenge, and there are only few recent epidemiological data regarding the outcome of these patients. In this multicentre survey, we evaluate the prognosis and outcome of patients with PIF-AML, who were diagnosed and treated in the last 5 yrs in four Italian institutions. RESULTS: One hundred PIF-AML were recorded, 57 males and 43 females, with a median age of 63 yrs (19-79), 42% were younger than 60 yrs; 42% had a secondary AML and 40% had an adverse karyotype. According to cytogenetic/molecular risk stratification at diagnosis, 33% of patients were classified as favourable/intermediate-1 risk and 56% as intermediate-2/adverse risk. After a median follow-up of 11 months (1-49), 77% of patients died, while 23% were alive (with 12/23 in cCR). Thirty-six patients underwent allogeneic SCT, and of these, 11 of 36 (31%) were alive at last follow-up. The 12- and 24-month OS probability of the whole population was 45% and 21%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the probability of OS of the whole population was significantly improved by Allo-SCT procedure (12-month OS probability 60% vs. 35%; P < 0.0001) and was better in patients with favourable/intermediate-1 risk at diagnosis (12-month OS probability 58% vs. 40%; P = 0.028). In transplanted cases, a pretransplant responsive disease was the only significant factor to predict a favourable outcome after Allo-SCT (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Treatment options of PIF-AML still are limited and the prognosis, even recently, remains extremely poor. This survey shows that PIF-AML is still rarely cured without Allo-SCT and confirms the importance of initiating an urgent unrelated donor search in cases without a matched sibling donor. Moreover, the outcome of Allo-SCT is better in patients who achieve a good AML debulking before transplant. To reach this goal, new predictive scores and new protocols of salvage therapy (with target drugs or combinations) need to be explored urgently in PIF-AML.\n",
      "The outcome in children with acute leukaemia with (n = 90) and without Down syndrome (n = 4377) was compared. Sixty three (70%) of those with Down syndrome had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and in comparison with 3664 (84%) controls had similar prognostic features except for a significant excess of the 'common' immunological subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The outcome of the children with Down syndrome was significantly worse with a five year overall actuarial survival of 28% compared with 59% in the control group. It appeared that both suboptimal chemotherapy and a high rate of infective problems contributed to the poor survival. Twenty six children with Down syndrome had acute myeloblastic leukaemia and were significantly younger and had a higher percentage of the megakaryocytic and erythroid subtypes of acute myeloblastic leukaemia than the 713 controls. The outcome was similar in the two groups. It is concluded that the patients with Down syndrome who develop acute leukaemia should receive standard protocols without modification, but aggressive supportive care is necessary to improve outcome.\n",
      "Retroviral insertional mutagenesis has been proposed as an efficient mechanism to turn on or to increase the expression of oncogenes in several avian or mammal models. Integration site studies of avian leukosis virus, murine leukaemia and murine mammary tumour viruses led to the coleutification of highly conserved genes whose expression is induced or increased during leukaemogenesis, probably through enhancer elements present in the retroviral long terminal repeats. This is reminiscent of the activation of cellular proto-oncogenes or putative oncogenes in numerous human tumours and leukaemias as a result of chromosomal translocations or DNA rearrangements. Here we report the characterization of a new putative oncogene isolated from a murine erythroleukaemia induced by the acute leukaemogenic retrovirus spleen focus forming virus (SFFV). An important and unusual feature of this genomic locus Spi-1 (for SFFV proviral integration) is that rearrangements due to SFFV integration were found in 95% of the erythroid tumours studied. A 4.0-kilobase messenger RNA was detected in rearranged tumours. No Spi-1 rearrangement was detected in other virally induced myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid tumours tested.\n",
      "76 adult acute nonlymphocytic leukaemias (ANLL) were characterized by cytochemical markers and placed in a coordinate system. The position of each ANLL was determined on the basis of the peroxidase and nonspecific esterase reactivity of the blast cells. This classification numerically identifies the maturation tendency and heterogeneity of individual ANLL cases according to its position in the coordinate system. 49 ANLL patients were treated with TAD protocol and the response rate seemed to be in a conspicous correlation with the position of the individual ANLL cases in the modified arrangement. Cases exhibiting a strong peroxidase maturation, i.e. the cytochemical maturation index being 80% or more had a considerable higher complete remission rate and longer duration of remission than those with low (less than 80%) maturation index. Age profoundly influenced even this figure.\n",
      "The promyelocytic blast crisis is a rare form of transformation during the evolution of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). We report a case of promyelocytic blast crisis with t(15;17) in addition to t(9;22). The morphology and immunophenotype of the blasts were similar to those seen in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). The t(15;17) was confirmed by FISH. The patient had evidence of coagulopathy with clinical and laboratory findings of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This report highlights the importance of correlating the results of multiple diagnostic methods in order to establish a correct diagnosis of the promyelocytic blast crisis of CML.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine if any excess of childhood leukaemia was associated with the large and increasing numbers of national military servicemen in 1949 and 1950, particularly in rural districts. This would be a further test of the hypothesis that childhood leukaemia can originate in an infection, the transmission of which is facilitated by an increased number of unaccustomed contacts in the community. DESIGN: Rural and urban districts, aggregated by county, were ranked by proportion of servicemen, and five groups containing similar numbers of children were created. In addition, individual local authority districts were ranked and grouped in tenths. Mortality from childhood leukaemia 1950-3 was examined in these groups. Data on infectious diseases were also examined, as well as data on leukaemia in later periods. SETTING: England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Children aged under 15 years. RESULTS: In 1950-3 but not subsequently a significant excess of leukaemia in children under 15 was found in the fifth of county groupings with the highest proportions of servicemen. This was due mainly to a significant excess in children under 2 years (and especially in those under 1 year) in rural districts. It was confirmed among the tenth of local authority districts with the highest proportion of servicemen. These rural areas showed significantly more notifications of, and deaths from, poliomyelitis among children than the rural average. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the infection hypothesis. That the excess of leukaemia was greatest in children under 1 year suggests transmission of infection among adults and thence to the fetus. The pattern of spread of poliomyelitis may also have been influenced by the presence of large numbers of servicemen.\n",
      "Recent results indicate that interactions of transcription factors with other nuclear proteins play an important role in stem cell development, lineage commitment and differentiation in the haematopoietic system, and the pathogenesis of myeloid leukaemias. High-throughput proteomics by mass spectrometric analysis of gel-separated proteins can identify multi-protein complexes and changes in the expression of multiple proteins simultaneously. This review describes an application of proteomic methods (2D gel electrophoresis (GE) and mass spectrometry (MS)), which can be used to identify regulated protein targets of transcription factors important in myeloid differentiation and leukaemia. This global high-throughput functional proteomics approach could lead to new insights into the network of protein-protein interactions and target proteins involved in myeloid stem cell development and leukaemia as well as provide new targets for rational pathogenesis-based therapies of leukaemia and cancer.\n",
      "Core binding factor (CBF) leukaemias, characterized by either inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(8;21)(q22;q22), constitute acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) subgroups with favourable prognosis. However, 40-50% of patients relapse, emphasizing the need for risk-adapted treatment approaches. In this regard, studying secondary genetic aberrations, such as mutations of the KIT gene, is of great interest, particularly as they can be targeted by receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, so far little is known about the biology underlying KIT-mutated CBF leukaemias. We analysed gene expression profiles of 83 CBF AML cases with known KIT mutation status in order to gain novel insights in KIT-mutated CBF pathogenesis. KIT-mutated cases were characterized by deregulation of genes belonging to the NFkB signalling complex suggesting impaired control of apoptosis. Notably, a subgroup of KIT wildtype cases was also characterized by the KIT mutation signature due to yet unknown aberrations. Our data suggest that this CBF leukaemia subgroup might profit from TKI therapy, however, the relevance of the KIT mutation-associated signature remains to be validated prior to clinical implementation. Nevertheless, the existence of such a signature supports the notion of relevant biological differences in CBF leukaemia and might serve as diagnostic tool in the future.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Record-based studies have generally reported association of higher childhood leukaemia incidence with higher socioeconomic status (SES), but recent findings are less consistent. METHODS: We examined records from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours for evidence of this association in England and Wales during 1976-2005. All eligible leukaemia registrations (N=11940) were grouped by year of diagnosis in decades centred on census years 1981, 1991 and 2001 (N=3748, 3922, 4270, respectively). Using data from the census appropriate to the decade, SES for each case was measured by the child-population-weighted quintile of the Carstairs deprivation index of the census ward containing the address at diagnosis. RESULTS: In each decade, the age-standardised leukaemia rate in the poorest quintile was ∼90% of the rate in the most affluent. Using Poisson regression, the age-adjusted rate ratio per quintile decrease in SES was 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.94-0.98; P<0.001 for trend) in 1976-1985, 0.97 (0.95-0.99; P=0.008) in 1986-1995 and 0.97 (0.95-0.99; P=0.009) in 1996-2005. Similar association was evident for lymphoid leukaemia, the major subgroup (N=9588 in total), but not for acute myeloid (N=1868) or other/unspecified leukaemia (N=484). CONCLUSION: Reported childhood leukaemia incidence in England and Wales continues to be higher in relatively affluent communities. Possible explanations include under-diagnosis of leukaemia in children from poorer communities, and/or association of higher SES with hypothesised risk factors, such as population mixing and delayed exposure to infection.\n",
      "A decrease in capillary flow due to hyperleucocytosis may cause impairment of organ perfusion in patients with leukaemia. In order to evaluate the effects of different cell types of leukaemic cell origin on skin capillary circulation we have studied patients with (a) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (n = 6) and (b) acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) (n = 6) or chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) (n = 5). Capillary blood cell velocity (CBV) in fingernail-fold capillaries was measured by videophotometric capillaroscopy. After a 1-min arterial occlusion at the finger base, the post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia was evaluated by measuring the peak (p) CBV and the time to pCBV. In patients with ANLL/GGL, both resting CBV and pCBV were lower than in healthy control subjects. In the CLL patients these values were not significantly different compared to controls. In a few patients the time to pCBV was markedly prolonged. Symptoms attributable to hyperviscosity were more common in patients with ANLL/CGL and low CBV values. It is suggested that the cell size of leucocytes may be an important factor in the development of hyperviscosity syndromes and organ malperfusion in leukaemic patients.\n",
      "Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) is a disease characterised by a distinctive marker that is the Philadelphia Chromosome and an ability to transform into blast phase, which confers a poor prognosis. The median survival was reported to be between three to six months in correlation to blast phase. Extramedullary involvement with CML to sites such as pleural, meningeal and bones have been reported. We report a case of 41-year-old man who was diagnosed with CML in blast phase and presented with ascites. Ultrasound of abdomen showed coarse echotexture of liver suggestive leukaemic infiltration to the liver. The liver profile was severely deranged and associated with coagulopathy. Flow cytometry analysis of the peritoneal fluid revealed presence of myeloblasts consistent with CML in blast crisis with leukaemic ascites. Bone marrow biopsy also confirmed disease transformation. He received standard induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia with dose modifications based on liver enzymes performance. Our case highlights an unusual presentation of CML in blast crisis with leukaemic ascites and the challenges in managing cytotoxic treatments due to the liver infiltration.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ≥50% erythroblasts comprise up to 5% of all cases of AML and 15% of MDS. The classification of these entities is currently fraught with difficulty and requires integration of clinical, morphological and cytogenetic features. The current World Health Organization classification of haematopoietic tumours recognises the entities of pure erythroid leukaemia and acute erythroid leukaemia (erythroid/myeloid), however, some cases of AML with erythroid predominance may also fulfil criteria for AML with myelodysplasia-related changes or therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Among these entities, pure erythroid leukaemia remains poorly characterised due to its rarity. In addition, there is significant clinicopathological overlap between acute erythroid leukaemia and cases of MDS with ≥50% erythroblasts. In this review, we discuss current areas of controversy regarding these disorders and present our approach to their diagnosis and classification.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of published studies on the association between residential/household/domestic exposure to pesticides and childhood leukaemia, and to provide a quantitative estimate of the risk. METHODS: Publications in English were searched in MEDLINE (1966-31 December 2009) and from the reference list of identified publications. Extraction of relative risk (RR) estimates was performed independently by 2 authors using predefined inclusion criteria. Meta-rate ratio estimates (mRR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect models. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for exposure time windows, residential exposure location, biocide category and type of leukaemia. RESULTS: RR estimates were extracted from 13 case-control studies published between 1987 and 2009. Statistically significant associations with childhood leukaemia were observed when combining all studies (mRR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.37-2.21). Exposure during and after pregnancy was positively associated with childhood leukaemia, with the strongest risk for exposure during pregnancy (mRR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.92-2.50). Other stratifications showed the greatest risk estimates for indoor exposure (mRR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.45-2.09), for exposure to insecticides (mRR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.33-2.26) as well as for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) (mRR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.53-3.45). Outdoor exposure and exposure of children to herbicides (after pregnancy) were not significantly associated with childhood leukaemia (mRR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.97-1.52; mRR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.76-1.76, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the assumption that residential pesticide exposure may be a contributing risk factor for childhood leukaemia but available data were too scarce for causality ascertainment. It may be opportune to consider preventive actions, including educational measures, to decrease the use of pesticides for residential purposes and particularly the use of indoor insecticides during pregnancy.\n",
      "Acute basophilic leukaemia is an uncommon form of acute leukaemia, rarely occurring as de novo disease. Due to rarity of the disease, consistent diagnostic criteria for the identification of this entity still remain the topic of discussion. Immunophenotypic profile, electron microscopy and cytogenetic analysis in addition to morphological features, are said to be highly desirable for correct identification of this entity. In set-up like ours, where such facilities are either not available or not in reach of the patients due to financial constraints, morphological features and simple technique like demonstration of metachromasia in blasts with toluidine blue stain remain the most useful diagnostic tool for identification of this rare condition. We present a case of acute basophilic leukaemia with (11q23)-MLL gene rearrangement, in an 18-year-old male with review of literature and discussion of diagnostic criteria.\n",
      "The study of disease clustering is becoming increasingly common in the field of medical epidemiology. There is great public concern and numerous reports on perceived clusters of various diseases, and with cancers, and especially leukaemia, being the most commonly studied. We present a population based study on acute childhood leukaemia in Sweden 1973-1993, illustrating the possibility of a system for full-scale spatial epidemiological study design. The aim of the study is to test a large set of childhood leukaemia cases for the presence of geographical clusters. Necessary prerequisites, in the form of extensive population and disease data, a tool for geographical spatial analysis and a proper statistical method were fulfilled. No significant clusters were found.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Automated haematology analysers may inaccurately determine platelet counts in several circumstances. Spuriously elevated automated platelet counts have been reported in some acute leukaemia (AL) cases because of fragmentation of circulating blast cells (pseudoplatelets). Haemorrhagic diathesis is a common manifestation of AL, which is often caused by severe thrombocytopenia. Therefore, overestimation of the actual platelet count in patients with AL can affect its clinical management. We aimed to detect the frequency of pseudoplatelets in patients with AL. METHODS: Complete blood cell counts were performed on 86 AL patients with three automated analysers (ADVIA 2120, Coulter LH 750 and Sysmex XE-2100D). Platelet counts were also performed by quantitative flow cytometry (QFC). The platelet counts of the automatic analysers were compared to the platelet counts by QFC. Blood smears were checked for the presence of pseudoplatelets. RESULTS: The automated analysers overestimated the platelet count due to the presence of pseudoplatelets in patients with AL. Pseudoplatelets were observed in the blood smears of 11 patients (13%). Three of these patients were near the prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold. CONCLUSION: Spurious increases in automated platelet counts by blast cell fragments are little known but frequent artefacts that should be ruled out by careful examination of peripheral blood smears.\n",
      "Allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplantation is a successful treatment for leukaemia and severe aplastic anaemia (SAA). Graft rejection following transplantation for leukaemia is a rare event but leukaemic relapse may occur at varying rates, depending upon the stage of leukaemia at which the transplant was undertaken and the type of leukaemia. Relapse is generally assumed to occur in residual host cells, which are refractory to, or escape from the myeloablative conditioning therapy. Rare cases have been described, however, in which the leukaemia recurs in cells of donor origin. Lack of a successful outcome of blood or bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anaemia (SAA), however, is due to late graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease. Leukaemia in cells of donor origin has rarely been reported in patients following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for SAA. This report describes leukaemic transformation in donor cells following a second allogeneic BMT for severe aplastic anaemia. PCR of short tandem repeats in bone marrow aspirates and in colonies derived from BFUE and CFU-GM indicated the donor origin of leukaemia. Donor leukaemia is a rare event following transplantation for severe aplastic anaemia but may represent the persistence or perturbation of a stromal defect in these patients inducing leukaemic change in donor haemopoietic stem cells.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine if the excess of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Seascale is restricted to those born in the parish and whether it might be explained by the postulated relation with paternal preconceptional radiation. DESIGN: Comparison, separately for those born in the parish and those born elsewhere, of the numbers of these malignancies observed in Seascale with those expected on the basis of reference rates for England and Wales. Details of paternal radiation levels were sought for each case. SETTING: The parish of Seascale in west Cumbria. SUBJECTS: Residents of Seascale below age 25 years in the years 1951-91. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The observed and expected numbers of cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma within Seascale among those born there and among those born elsewhere. Also, the levels of any paternal preconceptional radiation associated with each case. RESULTS: A significant excess of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma at ages 0-24 was found in Seascale in those who were born there (ratio of observed to expected cases 8.6 and 20.2 respectively; p < 0.01). This also applied to those not born there (7.2 and 16.5; p < 0.01), a group often regarded as not showing an excess. The estimates were then conservatively recalculated so as to overestimate the risks among those born in Seascale and underestimate them among those born elsewhere. On this basis the six cases in those born in Seascale compare with 0.38 expected (15.8; p < 0.001), of which two were associated with paternal preconceptional life-time levels of 100 mSv or greater and three others with levels of 90-99 mSv. Among those born elsewhere, there were five cases (expected 0.74; ratio 6.7, p < 0.01), of which only one was associated with a high level of such radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Paternal preconceptional radiation cannot be the sole cause of the excess in Seascale since it will not explain the excess among those born outside Seascale. It follows that, unless two causes are to be postulated, any single cause must be a factor other than paternal preconceptional radiation. On this basis, the association found among those born there, if not partly due to chance, may reflect an indirect relation with the true cause. The recent hypothesis about such paternal radiation has originated in a subgroup of the excess cases that have aroused concern.\n",
      "Hairy cell leukaemia variant is a very rare chronic lymphoproliferative disorder and is closely related to hairy cell leukemia. We hereby describe a case of hairy cell leukaemia variant for the first time in Saudi Arabia. An elderly Saudi man presented with pallor, massive splenomegaly, and moderate hepatomegaly. Hemoglobin was 7.7 g/dl, Platelets were 134 x109/l and white blood count was 140x10 9/l with 97% being abnormal lymphoid cells with cytoplasmic projections. The morphology, cytochemistry, and immunophenotype of the lymphoid cells were classical of hairy cell leukaemia variant. The bone marrow was easily aspirated and findings were consistent with hairy cell leukaemia variant.\n",
      "Newborns and children with Down Syndrome are predisposed to a range of blood disorders, which include acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute megakaryocytic leukaemia (AMKL). Over the last four years there has been considerable progress in our understanding of DS AMKL. Like other childhood leukaemias DS AMKL is initiated in utero and can present in the neonatal period as a clinically overt preleukaemic condition, transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD). In addition to trisomy 21, fetal haemopoietic progenitors acquire N-terminal truncating mutations in the key megakaryocyte-erythroid transcription factor GATA1. These are the minimum required events for TMD to develop. In approximately 30% of TMD patients, additional as yet unidentified (epi)genetic mutations are required for progression to AMKL. Thus, DS TMD and AMKL provide a unique model of childhood leukaemia where the preleukaemic and leukaemic phases are ascertainable and separable allowing distinct steps in leukaemogenesis to be studied individually. These findings also have implications for the clinical management of DS TMD and AMKL specifically and also of childhood leukaemia more generally.\n",
      "Patterns and trends in incidence of leukaemia and lymphoma in children aged under 15 years and resident in the North Western Regional Health Authority area of England at diagnosis, over the 35-year time period 1954-1988, were analysed. The study included 1407 cases registered with the Manchester Children Tumour Registry, 100% of which had a histologically or cytologically verified diagnosis. Log-linear modelling identified significant linear increases in acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) (average quinquennial increase 4%) and Hodgkin disease (HD) (10%), but not in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia nor non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Additionally, the chi 2 test for trend identified a significant increase in the incidence of chronic myeloid leukaemia. The possibility that the increases seen in ALL and HD are linked to increases in prevalence of unknown infectious agents is discussed.\n",
      "In an attempt to determine the possible predictive value of the main clinical and haematological initial features of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) on the evolution to acute leukaemia, as well as the real impact of such an event on survival, 35 such patients were submitted to multiple regression analyses. At the time of the study 30 out of the 35 patients had died, with a median survival of 8.2 months for the whole series. 12 patients (34%) developed acute leukaemia, between 1.5 and 42.1 months from diagnosis of CMML, the actuarial median time of acute transformation being 29.4 months. The initial bone marrow blast cell percentage was the only factor influencing the development of acute leukaemia. On the other hand, the multivariate survival study showed that acute transformation introduced in the model as a time-dependent variable had a clear-cut unfavourable influence on the outcome of CMML patients, as did palpable spleen, advanced age and marked monocytosis.\n",
      "A rare case of granulocytic sarcoma of orbit preceding the onset of acute meyloblastic leukaemia is presented. A 7-year-old boy presented with proptosis and no other systemic complaints. The appearance of an enlarged muscle in initial tomographic imaging with a normal peripheral blood picture caused a diagnostic problem. Biopsy suggested a diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma. Subsequent bone marrow study revealed the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "There is a paucity of informative data on the potentially important role of specific sites of chromosomal instability in oncogenic processes. Chromosome 2 deletions and rearrangements are known to characterise radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia in the mouse. Here we statistically establish a concordance between chromosome 2 breakpoint clusters in these leukaemias and chromosome 2 rearrangements carried at a high in vivo frequency by progeny of irradiated haemopoietic cells. Mechanisms of radiation myeloid leukaemogenesis are discussed with respect to multiple radiation-sensitive sites encoded on chromosome 2 and the possible influence of genomic imprinting on inductive processes.\n",
      "A total of 29 patients with acute leukaemia were prospectively randomized before starting cytostatic treatment to be nourished either with intensified oral nutrition (intervention group) or ad libitum nutritional intake during the whole tumour therapy (median 22 weeks). All received menus of free choice (daily offer of 1.0-2.0 g protein, 30-50 kcal kg-1 body weight (BW)). Beyond this, intervention patients received nutrition education, daily visits by the dietician and record of food intake, as well as a weekly assessment of subjective well-being (linear analogue self assessment 'LASA'). From the LASA items, the factors: 'malaise', 'psychological distress', 'therapy side-effects' were extracted by principal component analysis, and correlated to nutrient intake and nutritional status. At the end of antineoplastic induction therapy, after continuous hospitalization of 10 weeks (median), 31.3% of the controls had regained their initial nutritional status, and 68.8% of the intervention group. Mean daily energy intake was 23.2 kcal kg-1 BW during weeks with weight loss (constant weight: 30.9, weight gain: 39.3 kcal kg-1 BW). Nutritional behaviour correlated with subjective well-being, low intake with complaints of tumour treatment side effects and weight loss with malaise.\n",

We describe the occurrence of BOOP in three children, one with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and two with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. In the three patients, BOOP developed 10-20 days after a course of therapy with cytosine arabinoside and anthracyclines. The possible relationships between the small conducting airway lesions, lung toxic reaction to the drugs and/or nonidentified infectious agents are discussed.\n",
      "Leukaemic infiltration of the lungs may occur in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Pulmonary infiltrates are usually microscopic and invariably associated with hyperleucocytosis. Four AML patients with respiratory symptoms and low leucocyte counts underwent standard chest radiography, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) of the lungs. HRCT scans showed pulmonary infiltrates with alveolar, interstitial, mixed and peribronchial/perivascular patterns in all patients, including one with negative standard radiographic findings. Infectious agents were excluded. Histology of the lung biopsy/autopsy specimens showed leukaemic infiltrates. Pulmonary leukaemia may be the cause of pulmonary infiltrates, even in non-hyperleucocytosic AML patients with low blast counts.\n",
      "Flow cytometric detection of surface P-glycoprotein, a multidrug-resistant gene product, with a monoclonal antibody, MRK 16, was performed on cells obtained from 18 children with leukaemia and lymphoma. Of 18 patients examined, 1 with malignant lymphoma at relapse showed a significant increase in P-glycoprotein-positive cells and a strong resistance to chemotherapy. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein in a case with B-cell type malignant lymphoma was confirmed by immuno-precipitation and Northern hybridization analysis. The present study suggests that an increased expression of surface P-glycoprotein might be involved in multidrug resistance at least in a certain case of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma.\n",
      "Oxidative stress is related to ageing and degenerative diseases, including cancer. However, a moderate amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is required for the regulation of cellular signalling and gene expression. A low level of ROS is important for maintaining quiescence and the differentiation potential of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), whereas the level of ROS increases during haematopoietic differentiation; thus, suggesting the importance of redox signalling in haematopoiesis. Here, we will analyse the importance of ROS for haematopoiesis and include evidence showing that cells from leukaemia patients live under oxidative stress. The potential sources of ROS will be described. Finally, the level of oxidative stress in leukaemic cells can also be harnessed for therapeutic purposes. In this regard, the reliance of front-line anti-leukaemia chemotherapeutics on increased levels of ROS for their mechanism of action, as well as the active search for novel compounds that modulate the redox state of leukaemic cells, will be analysed.\n",
      "In this study, we develop a two-class classification system based on a committee of k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifiers. The system includes a sequence of simple data preprocessing steps. Each committee consists of 5 kNN classifiers of different architectures. Each classifier on the committee takes in a different set of features. The classification system is then applied to a set of microarray gene expression profiles from leukaemia patients. We show that the system can be effectively used for classifying microarray gene expression data. The results demonstrate the committee approach consistently outperforms individual kNN classifiers in terms of both classification accuracy and stability.\n",
      "The feasibility of marrow cryopreservation for autologous bone marrow transplantation after 7 d in liquid culture was assessed in 10 leukaemic patients. A median of 0.17 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg and 0.4 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg could be collected after the complete procedure, with overall a consistent cell loss. Long-term cultures could be established from these cultured and frozen marrows, showing the persistance of precursors of haematopoietic and stromal cells. In vitro a significant decrease in the proportion of leukaemic cells could be observed in only one out of nine evaluable patients. This patient, with refractory AML, received an autologous transplant and is alive in continuous complete remission after 600 d. One patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia in acute phase underwent an autologous BMT with a marrow collected and cultured while in chronic phase and failed to engraft. These results show the feasibility of cryopreservation of cultured marrow cells for autologous bone marrow transplantation. The procedure is associated with poor cell recovery and must be improved to have a more general clinical application. This technology may have a major application with the emergence of modulators of growth and differentiation of haematopoietic cell lines.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia is a disease with unfavourable prognosis. The significance of various prognostic parameters is not fully understood. We studied 293 patients to examine the influence of ethnicity and molecular markers. The median survival for all patients was correlated with age, white blood cell count and karyotype, and marginally with FLT3 internal tandem duplication. Arab patients were younger than Jewish patients; however, their survival was poorer albeit being treated with the same protocols and having more favourable cytogenetics. Survival rates improved over time but only for patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT). We conclude that in our young patient cohort, recent improvement in survival is attributed to alloBMT therapy and that ethnicity affected treatment outcome.\n",
      "We present a 46-year-old patient with Ph-chromosome negative, bcr-negative chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in accelerated phase with a clonal trisomy 21 in the leukaemic blast cells. A rapid progress of disease with appearance of monocytosis is described, showing similar features to chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Heterogeneous characteristics and possible distinction of these two entities are discussed.\n",
      "Resistance to cytotoxic agents is a common clinical problem encountered in the treatment of human myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). Cellular acquisition of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype confers loss of sensitivity to a wide range of structurally dissimilar anti-neoplastic agents. This state can arise through increased expression of the mdrl (P-glycoprotein) gene. We have used the mdrl gene probe to investigate adriamycin resistant (HL60/AR) and vinblastine resistant (CEM/VLB100) human leukaemic cell lines. In addition, peripheral blood or bone marrow cells from 66 patients with MDS and AML have been screened for gene amplification and 40 cases for increased mRNA expression. P-glycoprotein gene amplification was observed only in the (CEM/VLB100) and not in the HL60/AR on any other leukaemic cell line. Gene amplification was not found in any patient cells. Eighteen out of 40 patients showed an increase (2----20) of mdrl mRNA expression. These results are not only of significance in understanding the biology of human drug resistance but have practical importance in the design of anti-leukaemic therapy.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are considered a major problem among patients undergoing acute leukaemia (AL) induction treatment. PROphylaxis of Fungal invasive Infections in Leukaemia-Caspofungin (PROFIL-C) is a multicentre study aiming to assess the comparative yield of using caspofungin versus standard policy (SP) regimens and the overall impact of IFI in routine clinical care conditions. METHODS: All AL patients receiving IFI prophylaxis according to local SP were prospectively included in the study by Northern Italy Leukaemia Group (NILG) centres. To allow the comparison of caspofungin versus SP regimens as prophylaxis strategies, caspofungin treatment was assigned via a centralized randomized procedure. The study was registered at http://www.clinicaltrial.gov (NCT00501098). RESULTS: Over a 2 year period, 175 patients were included. The overall incidence of IFI was 32/175 (18.3%) [10/175 (5.7%) probable/proven and 22/175 (12.6%) possible], with no statistically significant differences between caspofungin-based versus SP-based regimens [overall: 15/93 (16.1%) versus 17/82 (20.7%), relative risk (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-1.46; probable/proven: 7/93 (7.5%) versus 3/82 (3.7%), RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.55-7.7; possible: 8/93 (8.6%) versus 14/82 (17.1%), RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.22-1.14]. Only one IFI-related death was recorded (10%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and mortality of IFI were lower than expected in this strictly sequential cohort representative of the routine care in the NILG network. The efficacy and safety of caspofungin were similar to other prophylactic regimens.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to systematically identify and synthesise all qualitative evidence on how adult patients diagnosed with acute leukaemia experience living with their illness. METHODS: A systematic search strategy was developed comprising of two search strings: i) acute leukaemia and ii) qualitative methodology. The search strategy was run in seven electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO, EMBASE, BNI & Archive, SSCI and ASSIA). Nine qualitative studies in adult patients with acute leukaemia, published in peer reviewed journals between 01/1990 and 01/2013 were included in the final sample. RESULTS: The qualitative thematic synthesis resulted in the development of a conceptual model describing a person path to build a renewed self. Following the initial blow of diagnosis with the range of initial reactions, patients with acute leukaemia are living in a contracting world; they have to deal with the life in hospital, the several losses and the impact of their illness on their emotions and interpersonal relationships. Several factors take up a buffering role at that stage: coping, support, information and hope. Finally, patients accommodate acute leukaemia in their lives through re-evaluating personal values and assigning new meaning to their experience. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this thematic synthesis are indicative of the impact of acute leukaemia on patients' lives and the processes they use to make sense and accommodate the illness in their life. Increasing our understanding of these processes is warranted to improve patient care.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of retinal changes in newly diagnosed acute leukaemia patients, and to establish the relationship between retinal lesions and haematological parameters in these patients. METHODS: A total of 127 patients with acute leukaemia (myeloid and lymphoid), of both genders, aged between 13 and 77 years, were examined by an ophthalmologist for retinal changes using direct/indirect ophthalmoscopy within 2 days of diagnosis before starting chemotherapy. RESULTS: Retinal lesions were seen in 62 cases (49%), with intraretinal haemorrhages being the most common lesion (42%). A high white blood cell count was significantly associated with intraretinal haemorrhages (p = 0.04) and white-centred haemorrhages (p = 0.001), while a low platelet count was significantly associated with intraretinal haemorrhages (p = 0.03) in acute myeloid leukaemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: A high white blood cell count may be considered as important as a low platelet count in the pathogenesis of leukaemic retinopathy.\n",
      "T-prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is a rare disorder with a poor outcome. Presentation features were studied in 78 T-PLL cases. Although 53 patients (group A) presented with typical progressive disease including rapidly increasing leucocytosis. 25 patients (group B) experienced an initial indolent clinical course with stable moderate leucocytosis. The morphology and antigenic profile of abnormal cells were similar in both groups, except for a lower incidence of CD45RO+ CD45RA- pattern in group B. A high incidence of inv(14)(q11;q32), t(14;14)(q11;q32) and i(8)(q10) chromosomal abnormalities were found in both groups. After an initial indolent phase (median 33 months; 6-103 months), 16 group B patients progressed to an aggressive stage with clinical and laboratory features similar to group A. Moreover, median survival after progression was short in both groups. In conclusion, T-PLL may start as an indolent disease similar to that reported in ataxia telangectasia. In this rare genetic disorder, some patients develop stable T-cell clones which progress toward T-PLL-like leukaemia. Moreover, ATM gene mutations have been reported in T-PLL. Thus, both diseases are likely to be closely related.\n",
      "In patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase treated by allogeneic transplantation using unmanipulated donor marrow cells the incidence of cytogenetic or haematological relapse is low. Occasional Ph positive metaphases have been identified in the marrow without subsequent evolution to haematological or clinical relapse. In contrast in patients transplanted with marrow depleted of T-cells Ph-positive cells are found frequently in the marrow and subsequent progression to haematological relapse is relatively common. These observations strongly support the concept of a graft-versus-leukaemia effect mediated by T-lymphocytes or by cells with a similar membrane phenotype.\n",
      "This study investigated the complete remission (CR) rate and survival of 623 newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in Shanghai, China, classified according to World Health Organization and French-American-British criteria, and compared the differences in treatment effect with those reported in developed countries and those reported in Shanghai from 1984 to 1994. Total CR rate was 66.5%, median survival was 18 months and estimated survival at 3 years was 30.8%. The 3-year relapse rate was 55.1%. These data showed that the CR rate was similar to that achieved in studies from developed countries, but long-term survival was worse. The CR rate and survival were increased markedly compared with data previously collected in Shanghai (1984 - 1994). Induction chemotherapeutic regimens based on idarubicin, daunorubicin or homoharringtonine all had similar CR rates and survivals. Karyotype was the most important prognostic factor. Multilineage dysplasia in de novo AML was not an independent prognostic factor. Improvement in the long-term treatment effect in China is an important challenge for the future.\n",
      "We investigated the effects of socioeconomic, demographic and health-related indicators on the incidence of and survival from haematological cancers diagnosed in 1994-2003 with follow-up through 2006 in Denmark using information from nationwide registers. The analyses were based on data on 636 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 4516 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 3486 with leukaemia in a cohort of 3.22 million people born between 1925 and 1973 and aged >or=30 years. No consistent differences in incidence were seen by socioeconomic position, but an association with comorbidity was found. Patients in the lowest socioeconomic groups and those with other serious illnesses, especially men, had a worse survival of NHL. Survival results for leukaemia tended to be similar to those for NHL, although associations were generally weaker and insignificant. Thus, there were no strong associations between socioeconomic position and the incidence of these cancers; survival after NHL might be affected.\n",
      "Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis using methotrexate (23 patients) and T-cell depletion of the graft (40 patients) was compared in 63 allogeneic bone marrow transplantations (BMT) for leukaemia. T-cell depletion significantly reduced (p = 0.001) the incidence of GvHD from 68% to 11% and the GvHD-associated mortality from 79% to 5%. Actuarial disease-free survival for low-risk patients (57% with T-cell depletion and 47% with MTX) was not significantly improved, due to graft failure and possibly due to a higher leukaemic relapse rate after T-cell depletion. Prevention of graft failure after T cell-depleted BMT is essential and could also reduce the risk of leukaemic relapse by improved engraftment.\n",
      "Administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy to a mechanically ventilated patient is a major undertaking. Induction of remission of leukaemia under such circumstances is an extremely rare event. We report two patients with partially refractory acute myeloid leukaemia who achieved remission of their leukaemia after receiving chemotherapy in the intensive care unit. Both patients were subsequently cured by allogeneic bone marrow transplant.\n",
      "A case of systemic mastocytosis associated with a clonal haematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD), where the associated disease is acute erythroid leukaemia (erythroid/myeloid type), is reported. Interestingly, molecular studies showed the KIT(D816V+) mutation not only in the mast cells, but also in the myeloid blast population and the leukaemic erythroid cells. As is the case with most erythroid leukaemias, the patient had a very aggressive clinical course and died shortly after diagnosis. It is believed that this is the first reported case of systemic mastocytosis with erythroid leukaemia where the KIT(D816V+) mutation was detected in all three cell types. Molecular findings provide evidence for derivation of these seemingly morphologically distinct lesions from the same clonal precursor cell. From a practice standpoint, this case illustrates the importance of definitively diagnosing the associated non-mast cell lineage disease due to its prognostic implications.\n",
      "The fate of the polycythaemic patient depends on the treatment employed which may determine the nature of the transformation commonly occurring late in the course of the disease. Treatment is, on the other hand, aimed at prevention of the most frequent complications, that is of thromboembolic processes. In the last 30 years the authors treated a total of 118 PV patients, of whom 60 have died. Initially 32P treatment was applied, which was modified later, because of acute leukaemia that had occurred in 9% of the treated cases, to a single 5 mC 32P+Myelobromol (DBM) treatment. Still later only DBM was administered in the form of stosstherapy (2500 mg per day over a period of 4 days). In the latter two groups, acute leukaemia occurred as few as two cases. The course of untreated polycythaemia vera is characterized by transformation into another myeloproliferative disease. This phenomenon occurs in 50% of the cases on drastic treatment and in patients treated with 32P. Of the patients who were alive when the report was finished 35% had been free of complications, while 5.2% were suffering from chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), 34.5% from sclerotic osteo-myelofibrosis (OMF-SC) and 3.4% from chronic megakaryocytic granulocytiv leukaemia (CMGL). Of the 60 patients having died, 15% had suffered from other complications being predominantly of vascular nature. 11.8% of them died of AML, 10% of CGL, 26.7% of OMF-SC and 26.7% of CMGL. The terminal stage was characterized, in the majority of cases, by blastic crisis. Based on their own results and literary data authors recommend DBM treatment besides the indispensable phlebotomy.\n",
      "Treatment-related chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a less commonly recognised entity. It differs from treatment-related acute leukaemias in frequency, clinical course, and prognosis. Previously two cases of CML have been described following treatment of myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma treated by thymectomy. We report a 25-yr-old man with myasthenia gravis without thymoma who developed CML, 68 months after thymectomy. Cytogenetic study showed translocation (9,22)(q34;q11) with 10% showing double Ph chromosome. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of peripheral blood demonstrated the presence of p210(BCR/ABL) with b3a2 transcripts. He was treated with hydroxyurea, and still remained in the chronic phase during the last 6 months of follow up. His myasthenic symptoms remained stable.\n",
      "Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is a known grave complication of leukaemia and has been described post mortem following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Ante mortem following BMT, the incidence and significance of ICH is not well defined. The records of 471 bone marrow transplantation recipients over 11 years at the Hadassah University Hospital Bone Marrow Transplantation Department were reviewed. The relevant data of all patients with ICH were analysed. A resolute diagnostic and treatment protocol for subdural haematomas had been employed. The indication for transplantation in 273 of the patients was leukaemia. Thirteen of these patients developed subdural haematomas within 42 days of the transplant, and nine of these haematomas were bilateral. None of the 198 patients with other malignancies or nonmalignant indications for BMT (predominantly aplastic anaemia and beta thalassaemia major) had subdural haematomas. One thalassaemia patient and three leukaemia patients had intracerebral haematomas. There was no mortality or major morbidity from the subdural haematomas, which were all successfully resolved. In contrast, all of the patients with intracerebral haematomas consequently died. Subdural haematomas occur in approximately 5% of patients with leukaemia following BMT, but the clinical outcome is relatively benign. Intracerebral haematomas are a sporadic, lethal complication following BMT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "To investigate if decreased exposure to common childhood infections is associated with risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) we conducted a case-control study of 1842 newly diagnosed and immunophenotypically defined cases of ALL under age 15, and 1986 matched controls in the US. Data regarding day care, sibship size and common childhood infections were obtained through parental interviews. Data were analysed stratified by leukaemia lineage and separately for 'common' childhood ALL (age 2-5 years, CD19, CD10-positive). Neither attendance at day care nor time at day care was associated with risk of ALL overall or 'common' ALL. Ear infections during infancy were less common among cases, with odds ratios of 0.86, 0.83, 0.71 and 0.69 for 1, 2-4, 5+ episodes, and continuous infections respectively (trend P = 0.026). No effect of sibship size or birth interval was seen. With one exception (ear infections), these data do not support the hypothesis that a decrease in the occurrence of common childhood infection increases risk of ALL.\n",
      "Osteopetrosis is a rare disease characterised by an increase in bone mass, skeletal malformations and bone marrow failure due to defective bone resorption. We report a 3-month-old male child presented with chest infections, failure to thrive and hepatosplenomegaly and diagnosed with osteopetrosis associated with acute myeloid leukaemia M3 type (AML-M3). The patient died on day 7 of admission due to respiratory failure. To our knowledge, this is the first case where both osteopetrosis and AML is diagnosed in a patient.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the hallmark developments in induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia and further describes future directions in its evolution. RECENT FINDINGS: We describe the origin of induction chemotherapy. We also describe notable modifications and adjustments to 7+3 induction chemotherapy since its development. Finally, we describe new efforts to modify and add new agents to induction therapy, including '7+3 Plus' combinations. SUMMARY: Induction chemotherapy remains the standard of care for the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. However, its success is limited in a subset of patients by toxicity, failure to achieve remission and potential for subsequent relapse. Novel agents such as mutant fms like tyrosine kinase 3 inhibitors, mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors, CD33-antibody drug conjugates and liposomal formulations have demonstrated significant potential as modifications to traditional induction chemotherapy.\n",
      "Since the launch of their first trial in Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 1959, the Medical Research Council (and latterly National Cancer Research Institute) has conducted randomised trials in AML uninterrupted for six decades. These sixty years have seen a transformation in the way we diagnose, characterise and treat the disease, (and indeed a sea change in clinical trial regulations) and a continuing improvement in outcomes. The increasing refinement of diagnosis, leading to the advent of tailored therapies, and the use of disease monitoring both have the potential to improve outcomes further, but the associated complexities will require an evolution in our approach to trial design. This article looks at the extent to which the guiding principles of the first AML trials remain relevant today, and the challenges facing the next generation of trials methodologists.\n",
      "The diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders is based on a combined evaluation of the clinical, immunological and morphological findings. Cytological details may vary with the quality of the smear. We report two cases of prolymphocytic leukaemia in which cytoplasmic hairs or protrusions were observed when the films were not dried quickly. In one case the artifacts led to an initial erroneous interpretation of hairy cell leukaemia 'variant'. The cytoplasmic outline was smooth in both cases when the smears were immediately fan-dried. The findings underscore the necessity of high standards of excellence, even for the simple technique of blood film preparation, in order to avoid undesirable artifacts which may result in diagnostic misinterpretation.\n",
      "The objective of this study was to assess the attitudes and views of young people receiving treatment for cancer, along with the views of their parents, their healthy peers and those involved in treating them without a cancer centre. The study analysed qualitative data collected using focus groups and patient interviews. Fourteen patients aged between 15 and 20 years were interviewed at a major cancer centre in Yorkshire. A focus group of healthy adolescents was held at a location away from the hospital to gain the perspectives of healthy adolescents. No disadvantages of a more centralized model of care for adolescents were discovered. The particular feature felt to be important was the expertise of the staff rather than the physical environment. Some suboptimal care was identified in referring units, though this appeared to apply to that associated with the treatment of solid tumours rather than leukaemias. The case for a more centralized approach to the management of young people with cancer is confirmed, and supports the model already implemented in the care of children with cancer.\n",
      "Natural killer cell leukaemia is generally accompanied by extramedullary involvement. CD4+ natural killer cell leukaemia frequently manifests with cutaneous involvement. The disease pursues a very aggressive course with no long-term survivors reported. We present a patient with CD4+ natural killer cell leukaemia with skin, bone marrow and peripheral blood involvement who is still on remission at the end of 2 years.\n",
      "Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), designated M3, is a particularly interesting subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) that has unique molecular and clinical characteristics. It is characterized by an arrest of myeloid differentiation at the promyelocyte stage with abnormal proliferation of these cells. Recent paediatric and adult trials which included all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have shown that APL has significantly better survival rates than other subtypes of AML. While there is extensive literature on APL in adults, articles dedicated to describing solely paediatric patients are limited. This chapter focuses on the incidence, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, treatment, and survival rates of children with APL.\n",
      "The aetiology of most cases of childhood leukaemia remains unknown, but several studies have indicated that increased birthweight and height are risk factors for the disease. Since insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) mediates the effect of growth hormone and has been positively associated with prostate cancer, we have evaluated the role of this hormone and its principal binding protein, IGFBP-3, in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. Incident cases of childhood leukaemia from those recorded by a national network of childhood oncologists were enrolled in our study. Controls were children hospitalised for acute conditions of no more than moderate severity with matching for gender, age and maternal place of residence. Blood measurements of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were undertaken using commercially available radioimmunoassays. Serum IGF-I values decreased by about 1.7% per month, and the rate of decline was higher, though not significantly so, among cases (2.1% per month) than among controls (1.4%). There was no significant association between IGF-I and the likelihood of childhood leukaemia, but an increment of 1 microg/ml of IGFBP-3 was associated with a substantial and statistically significant reduction of childhood leukaemia by 28% (95% confidence interval 7% to 45%). Because IGFBP-3 is essentially a binding protein, we interpret our findings as indicating that bioavailable IGF-I may play an important role in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. The much smaller quantities and the inherent instability of IGF-I in the blood in comparison to those of IGFBP-3 are likely to hinder documentation of an underlying positive association of IGF-I with the disease.\n",
      "AIMS: Pure erythroid leukaemia (PEL) is a rare subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and its clinicopathological features are not well-defined. The aim of this study was to describe the immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and clinical features of PEL and to compare these with cases of AML with ≥ 50% erythroblasts. METHODS: Cases of PEL according to WHO morphological criteria diagnosed at three institutions from 1997 to 2013 were included. A comparison cohort comprised of AML with ≥ 50% erythroblasts. The clinical, histopathology, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features of cases were analysed. We also reviewed the existing literature on PEL, and combined our cohort with previously reported cases of PEL in a pooled analysis. RESULTS: There were seven cases of PEL diagnosed at our institutions. There was a high incidence of either prior chemoradiotherapy exposure or evolution from pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (71%). The leukaemic blasts frequently expressed glycophorin C (100%), CD117 (83%) and were myeloperoxidase negative (83%). Complex karyotypes were present in 83% of cases. Median overall survival was 2.9 months. Compared with AML with ≥ 50% erythroblasts, cases of PEL demonstrated a higher incidence of adverse-risk cytogenetics (p=0.01) and prior exposure to chemoradiotherapy (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PEL appears to be a unique entity that is often secondary or therapy related, commonly features a complex karyotype and has a poor prognosis. It is morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct from other cases of AML with erythroid hyperplasia.\n",
      "Cancer subtype diagnosis using microarray signatures has the potential to transform pathological diagnosis but the routine measurement of genes signatures remains difficult. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) measurement of Indicator genes for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was used to determine gene signatures. Bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells were sorted into total, CD34(+) and CD34(-) fractions, and mRNAs globally amplified from each fraction using polyA PCR. The expression profile of the 17 top-ranked genes distinguishing AML and ALL were measured by RT-PCR in five ALL, 26 AML, 12 AML remission, four chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and nine morphologically normal BM samples. All but two of the genes measured showed similar expression in AML and ALL to that reported previously. Specifically, c-MYB (P </= 0.04) was significantly increased in ALL in the total fraction, whilst HOXA9 (P </= 0.19) and cystatin c (P </= 0.01) were increased in AML in the CD34(+) and CD34(-) fractions, respectively. c-MYB, hSNF2, RBAP48, HKRT-1, LYN, CD33, Adipsin and HOXA9 were increased in AML compared with remission AML, indicating an ability to determine disease activity. The method used is simple, sensitive and robust, enabling routine clinical use, and it can also be extended to other tumours types with gene signatures.\n",
      "A hospital-based epidemiological study of de novo acute leukaemia was carried out in the Sultanate of Oman, a sparsely populated Arabian Gulf country which has undergone rapid and dramatic socio-economic changes recently. A total of 65/99 Omanis (66%) were diagnosed as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 34/99 (34%) as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Trends and peak values in age-specific incidence rates for ALL are generally in line with those of Western countries. The proportion of T-ALL cases is however higher than that in Caucasian populations but lower than in many non-white populations. AML frequency particularly in childhood is similar to that observed in many African countries.\n",
      "We report a survey of audience members' responses (147 questionnaires collected at seven performances) and 10 in-depth interviews (five former patients and two family members, three medical practitioners) to bloodlines, a medical performance exploring the experience of haematopoietic stem-cell transplant as treatment for acute leukaemia. Performances took place in 2014 and 2015. The article argues that performances that are created through interdisciplinary collaboration can convey otherwise 'inaccessible' illness experiences in ways that audience members with personal experience recognise as familiar, and find emotionally affecting. In particular such performances are adept at interweaving 'objectivist' (objective, medical) and ubjectivist' (subjective, emotional) perspectives of the illness experience, and indeed, at challenging such distinctions. We suggest that reflecting familiar yet hard-to-articulate experiences may be beneficial for the ongoing emotional recovery of people who have survived serious disease, particularly in relation to the isolation that they experience during and as a consequence of their treatment.\n",
      "Pyoderma gangrenosum has been recognized occurring in association with acute and chronic leukaemia. More recently it has been described in patients with myelodysplasia (Jacobs, Palmer & Gordon-Smith 1985). We report a case of pyoderma gangrenosum in a patient with a preceding history of myelodysplasia, illustrating the problem of controlling the skin disease in this condition and the eventual transformation of the myelodysplasia into acute leukaemia. Treatment of the leukaemia resulted in improvement of the skin lesions.\n",
      "Changes in the activity and transcription of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: beta-D-mannoside beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase III (GnT-III: EC 2.4.1.144) were investigated in haematological malignancies. GnT-III activity was elevated in patients with chronic myelogeneous leukaemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) and patients with multiple myeloma (MM); whereas most of the normal healthy subjects and patients with other haematological malignancies, including CML in its chronic phase, showed negligible activity. The GnT-III transcript of leukaemic cells from various haematological diseases showed a single band with a similar size. The ratio of GnT-III activity per normalized transcript in CML-BC was considerably higher than in the other conditions, which provided the possibility that in CML-BC the transcript or the enzyme protein might be more stable, or that a post-translational modification of the enzyme might enhance its activity. Furthermore, a lectin blot analysis of patient specimens and a lectin fluorescence study of CML cell lines revealed that E4-PHA binding to surface glycoproteins correlated with GnT-III activity, indicating that more bisecting GlcNAc was added to these glycoproteins, catalysed by elevated GnT-III in CML-BC.\n",
      "The t(1;19)(q23;p13) translocation occurs commonly in B-lineage ALL. Previous reports have demonstrated a predominance of cases with expression of cytoplasmic Ig mu (C mu+), and FAB L1/L2 phenotype, a poor prognosis and expression of a fusion transcript involving the E2A and PBX1 genes in C mu+ but not in C mu- cases. Of 38 patients with karyotypically proven t(1;19) (q23;p13) leukaemias, we extensively analysed 18 patients with acute leukaemia including 16 B-lineage ALLs, one T-ALL and one AML M4. The AML was associated with a classic E2A-PBX1 fusion transcript and may represent the human counterpart of the AMLs induced by E2A-PBX1 retroviral infection of murine marrow progenitors. The T-ALL was E2A-PBX1 negative and neither the E2A nor the LYL-1 genes, both situated at chromosome 19 p13, were rearranged. Of the 16 B-lineage ALLs, four had cytological features resembling an 'L3-like' phenotype classically associated with Burkitt lymphoma, two at diagnosis and relapse and two exclusively at relapse. E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in all 13 C mu+ patients and in 2/3 C mu- cases. The 'L3-like' phenotype did not correlate with a particular stage of maturation arrest (one sIg+, one C mu+, one C mu-) or type of E2A-PBX1 transcript, but was associated in all cases with a trisomy 8. Translocation, rearrangement, amplification or over-expression of the c-myc gene was not observed in these cases, demonstrating that the apparent association with trisomy 8 is not due to deregulation of this gene. We therefore show that the E2A-PBX1 transcript, although occurring predominantly in C mu+ pre-B ALL, also occurs in C mu- early pre-B ALL, sIg+ B-ALL and even in AML. These results suggest that the stage of maturation arrest, and indirectly the prognosis, are not solely due to the type of fusion transcript associated with the t(1;19).\n",
      "Pure erythroid leukaemia is a rare subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and its occurrence at acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) relapse has not been reported earlier. A 39-year-old man received chemotherapy for Philadelphia-negative B cell ALL. Subsequently, he developed pure erythroid leukaemia with >80% immature erythroid precursors in bone marrow showing block positivity on periodic acid-Schiff stain, expressing CD71, CD34 but lacking CD235a. The interval between exposure to multidrug chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide and AML diagnosis was 2 years and 9 months. No cytogenetic abnormality was detected at the time of relapse. The patient died 2 weeks after starting AML chemotherapy. The relatively narrow time interval (usually 5-10 years) between chemotherapy and AML development and normal karyotype at relapse raises a possibility of lineage switch besides therapy-related AML as the likely pathogenesis. Further exploration of such cases may unravel the pathways responsible for lineage assignment in pluripotent stem cells.\n",
      "In a search for mechanisms of potential graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) activity after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), peripheral lymphocytes from five patients (four chronic myeloid leukaemia, one acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) 24-39 days post-transplant were precultured with pretransplant host leukaemia cells and then cloned by limiting dilution with interleukin-2 (IL-2). Clones obtained were exclusively CD3+ CD56-, carried the alpha/beta form of the T cell receptor for antigen, and were mostly (88% of 138) CD4+. None of 143 clones, including CD8+ clones, convincingly lysed host pretransplant cells, although 35 (24.5%) manifested lytic potential in lectin-mediated cytotoxicity assays. Measuring the proliferative responses of 118 of these clones in the presence of exogenous IL-2 revealed that a small number of clones reacted more strongly to host leukaemia than to unrelated leukaemias or B lymphoblastoid cell lines. In the two cases tested, the donor untransplanted lymphocytes cloned under the same conditions as post-transplant cells did not generate any clones reacting preferentially with host leukaemia cells. These results may suggest that some T cells appearing shortly after allogeneic BMT could potentially mediate anti-leukaemia activity not associated with cytolysis of target cells.\n",
      "For the diagnosis of leukaemia and leukaemic lymphoma, clinicians frequently have to rely on the results of immunophenotyping. To improve the quality of these results, the Dutch Foundation for Immunophenotyping of Haematological Malignancies (SIHON) initiated external quality rounds in 1986. Over a period of more than 10 years, this has led to improvements in the interpretation of immunophenotyping results. However, the evaluation of results focused mainly on the correctness of the interpretation of the immunophenotypical data, leaving the preceding analytical phases unevaluated. Therefore, in 1996 SIHON developed a more comprehensive scoring system, called SIHONSCORE, covering all three phases of immunophenotyping, namely the pre-analytical (i.e. choice of the staining panels), analytical (i.e. the technical part consisting of sample preparation, data acquisition and analysis) and the post-analytical phase (i.e. the interpretation) of the laboratory process. Here, we report how SIHONSCORE was successfully applied to three consecutive external quality rounds consisting of a total of nine different cases tested. For laboratory certification, participation in external quality control programmes is required. Evidently, criteria are needed to define the minimum acceptable performance of a certified laboratory. With SIHONSCORE, a useful instrument is obtained evaluating all phases of the performance of laboratories in leukaemia and lymphoma immunophenotyping.\n",
      "Notably raised rates of childhood leukaemia incidence have been found near some nuclear installations, in particular Sellafield and Dounreay in the United Kingdom, but risk assessments have concluded that the radiation doses estimated to have been received by children or in utero as a result of operations at these installations are much too small to account for the reported increases in incidence. This has led to speculation that the risk of childhood leukaemia arising from internal exposure to radiation following the intake of radioactive material released from nuclear facilities has been substantially underestimated. The radionuclides discharged from many nuclear installations are similar to those released into the global environment by atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, which was at its height in the late-1950s and early-1960s. Measurements of anthropogenic radionuclides in members of the general public resident in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay have found levels that do not differ greatly from those in persons living remote from nuclear installations that are due to ubiquitous exposure to the radioactive debris of nuclear weapons testing. Therefore, if the leukaemia risk to children resulting from deposition within the body of radioactive material discharged from nuclear facilities has been grossly underestimated, then a pronounced excess of childhood leukaemia would have been expected as a consequence of the short period of intense atmospheric weapons testing. We have examined childhood leukaemia incidence in 11 large-scale cancer registries in three continents for which data were available at least as early as 1962. We found no evidence of a wave of excess cases corresponding to the peak of radioactive fallout from atmospheric weapons testing. The absence of a discernible increase in the incidence of childhood leukaemia following the period of maximum exposure to the radioactive debris of this testing weighs heavily against the suggestion that conventional methods are seriously in error when assessing the risk of childhood leukaemia from exposure to man-made radionuclides released from nuclear installations.\n",
      "For a disease initially described in 1958 as a leukaemic reticulo-endotheliosis associated with poor outcomes, we have come a long way in our understanding of Hairy cell leukaemia. The vast majority of patients diagnosed with this rare, often diagnostically challenging, leukaemia can now expect a lifespan that is similar to the general population. This article covers some of the highlights from the last 6 decades that have led to our current understanding of this fascinating leukaemia - from elucidation of its B-cell origin to discovery of the almost universal occurrence of the BRAF V600E mutation; from the initial successes reported with splenectomy to the more recent development of targeted therapies such as Vemurafenib and Moxetumomab Pasudotox. It also pays tribute to some of the outstanding research in this field focusing particularly on the significant contributions made by the clinical and scientific community in the UK.\n",
      "Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) may be characterized simultaneously as the most potentially rapidly fatal human acute leukaemia if untreated, yet the most frequently cured acute leukaemia if promptly diagnosed and treated without delay. Co-operative group and single-institution studies which include large numbers of patients with relatively long follow-up demonstrate that, with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy, the majority of newly-diagnosed patients appear cured of their disease. The 5-year disease-free survival rates range from 75 to 85%. Early death is still observed in approximately 10% of patients and remains a difficult obstacle to increasing the cure rate. Prognostic factors which identify patients at high risk for recurrence are becoming increasingly recognized. Older age (over age 55-60 years), elevated white blood cell count at presentation (higher than 5,000-10,000/microl), and expression of CD56 unfavourably influence outcome. The treatment of such patients remains a challenge, although it is important to note that APL is the only type of AML in which a significant proportion of older patients may be cured. Because more patients are cured of their disease, potential long-term consequences may become increasingly recognized. These include the emergence of extramedullary disease, the development of secondary myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukaemia and the potential for late-onset cardiac toxicity.\n",
      "Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is an orphan subtype of leukaemia which constitutes less than 2% of all leukaemia, with an incidence of less than 1 per 100,000 persons per annum. Median age at presentation is 55 years and it is 3-4 times more frequent in males. It is also more frequently encountered in whites and less in Asians, Africans and Arabs. The epidemiologic data are multi-factorial and influenced by ethnicity and geographical factors. Other reported associations relate to some environmental exposures and possible occupational factors. Smoking appears to have an inverse correlation with the development of hairy cell leukaemia, while farming and exposure to pesticides, petroleum products, diesel and ionizing radiation have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk. National and international collaborative efforts are needed in order to undertake more extensive studies involving larger patient cohorts, aiming to determine the role of occupational and environmental risk factors in the development of this rare form of chronic leukaemia.\n",
      "Early studies suggested that the risk of haemorrhagic complications become unacceptable when platelet counts drop below 20 x 10(9)/l. Because there are insufficient data to define 20 x 10(9)/l as the threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusions, the practicability of a more restrictive transfusion policy has been assessed prospectively in 102 consecutive patients being treated for acute leukaemia. Besides platelet count, the transfusion protocol took into consideration factors such as presence of bleeding, fever, coagulation disorders, and intention to do therapeutic procedures. 31 major bleeding episodes occurred on 1.9% of the study days when platelet counts were 10 x 10(9)/l or less and on 0.07% of study days when counts were 10-20 x 10(9)/l. The findings indicate that the threshold for prophylactic transfusions can safely be set at 5 x 10(9)/l in patients without fever or bleeding manifestations and at 10 x 10(9)/l in patients with such signs. For patients with coagulation disorders or anatomical lesions, or for those on heparin, the threshold should be at least 20 x 10(9)/l. Such a restrictive platelet transfusion policy, which is applicable not only to thrombocytopenia associated with acute leukaemia but also to other forms of hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, reduces exposure of such patients to blood donors and results in substantial health-care savings.\n",
      "To evaluate the effect of leukaemia and its treatment on growth and puberty, we studied retrospectively the serial heights and pubertal development of 37 children with acute leukaemia. The age of diagnosis ranged from 10 months to 13 years, with a duration of follow-up varying from 2 years to 14 years. The SDS (Z score) which reflects the deviation of height measurements from the population mean was used to assess height change at yearly intervals. Pubertal assessment was also made using the Tanner standards. 25 (69%) children showed a falling trend in mean Z scores over a 5 year follow-up period. The difference between the mean Z scores at 0 and 5 years was statistically significant (p < 0.035). However, there was no significant correlation between age of onset of disease and duration of survival with the deviation in the Z score. 11 children did not demonstrate a fall in the Z scores. There were, however, no defined factors such as age of onset, duration of follow-up, and sex distribution which could predict growth failure. Pubertal assessment showed normal development in all children with the pubertal age group (n = 11), except for 3 boys, two of whom had received testicular irradiation.\n",
      "We evaluated the incidence of FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation in childhood acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosed over 15 years. FLT3/ITD was found in 10 of 45 (22.2%) non-acute promyelocytic leukaemia (non-APL) patients. The 5-year event-free survival of non-APL patients was higher in FLT3/ITD-negative versus -positive patients (48.9%, SE 8.9, vs 20.0%, SE 16.1, P = 0.03). In childhood APL, FLT3/ITD incidence was higher than in non-APL, although not statistically significant (10 out of 29 patients, 34.5%, P = 0.29). In APL patients, FLT3/ITD was strongly correlated to a higher white blood cell count at diagnosis and the M3 French-American-British subtype.\n",
      "Congenital transient leukaemia (CTL) is a haematological disorder characterized by proliferation of myeloblasts within the bone marrow and peripheral blood of affected newborns. Infants with Down syndrome are most frequently affected and although the disorder can result in fetal death due to hydrops, it typically resolves spontaneously after birth. We present a case of prenatally diagnosed fetal hydrops accompanied by splenomegaly and an enlarged, echogenic liver in a fetus identified with CTL after birth.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Flavonoids have been shown to have a wide variety of biological activities and proven to be good scaffolds for the design of DNA-binding agents as anticancer therapeutics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In structure-activity relationship studies, flavonoid derivatives were designed and synthesised through various organic synthesis protocols, resulting in novel or previously described molecules. These were studied by UV-Vis absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as competition dialysis for their binding to DNA isoforms. Their cytotoxic potential was assessed using MTS assays on MCF-7 breast cancer and CCRFCEM leukaemia cell lines. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Introduction of moieties such as chloride, nitrogen, acetoxy and methoxy groups did not help to improve binding affinity, but introduction of tertiary amines improved the binding 1,000-fold due to an improved interaction of the compound with the nucleic acid; replacement of oxygen by sulphur increased the binding 7-fold, possibly because sulphur being less electronegative than oxygen would allow the electrons of the molecule to interact more strongly with the nucleic acid. Inhibition of growth by 50% (IG(50)) values were moderate in breast and leukaemia cancer cell lines possibly due to the flavonoids interacting with other cellular components besides the nucleic acids.\n",
      "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine high cost factors to help managers and clinicians to analyse the reasons of adverse costs and provide indications for financial negotiation. DESIGN: To locate high cost or long stay patients, the analysis was designed on the basis of a mixture of Weibull distributions. In this new model, the proportion of high cost patients was expressed according to the multinomial logistic regression, permitting the determination of high cost factors. SETTING: The 1993 French reference database, constituted in the framework of the national study of DRG costs, conducted by the French Ministry of Health. The database of discharge abstracts recorded in 1993 in the Dijon public teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The analyses were based on 1352 abstracts from the French reference database and 368 from the Dijon database concerning patients, aged 18 and over, suffering from leukaemia and lymphoma. MAIN RESULTS: High cost and long stay factors were the same: number of stays, death, transfer, acute leukaemia, neutropenia, septicaemia, high dose aplastic chemotherapy, central venous catheterisation, parenteral nutrition, protected or laminar airflow room, blood transfusion, and intravenous antibiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account high cost predictive factors, as shown in the case of leukaemia and lymphoma patients, would help to reduce the adverse effects of a prospective payment system.\n",
      "Several leukaemia-specific antigens have been discovered in the recent past, which raised the possibility for T-cell-based immunotherapy for leukaemia. However, failure of such approaches involving interleukin-2 and/or T-cell-based immunotherapy indicated the importance of investigation of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) status of the haematopoietic malignant cells. Considerable number of reports indicate that both HLA class I and class II are down-regulated in different cases of leukaemias, enabling them to evade immuno-surveillance. However, locus-specific down-regulation in leukaemia has not been widely investigated, although majority of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are modulated by HLA-A and HLA-B, whereas expression of only HLA-C is unable to block natural killer (NK)-cell-mediated cytotolysis. Therefore, using RT-PCR, we have investigated the HLA class I transcriptional expression in a locus-specific manner, along with HLA-associated accessory molecules beta2-microglobulin and transporter-associated antigen processing molecule (TAP1). Our data suggest that in several newly diagnosed untreated leukaemic patients, HLA-C and beta2-microglobulin are expressed, but not the locus HLA-A or -B. Moreover, TAP1 and beta2-microglobulin were observed to be down-regulated in a number of cases of leukaemia. Our flow cytometric analysis of HLA-ABC also indicates a decrease in mean fluorescent intensity but no complete loss in surface expression of HLA class Ia on the leukaemic cells. Therefore, the observed low surface expression of HLA-ABC may be due to the down-regulation of transcription of HLA-A or -B itself and/or transcriptional suppression of the accessory molecules.\n",
      "An association between the complete or partial loss of chromosome 7 and preleukaemic myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukaemia has been recognized from the early days of tumour cytogenetic analysis. Detection of such abnormalities usually heralds a poor prognosis. The loss of DNA on chromosome 7 has led to speculation that tumour-suppressor genes may play a significant role in this form of leukaemogenesis, although it may be part of a multistep process. A further association with leukaemia secondary to carcinogen exposure including previous chemotherapy or a number of congenital anaemias has increased the interest in discovering the gene or genes on chromosome 7. Banded chromosome analysis has suggested that there are two broad critical regions on the long arm of chromosome 7 at bands 7q22 and 7q34-q36 that may contain the relevant genes. Initial molecular analysis has confirmed these two regions to be of significance. The advent of fluorescence in-situ hybridization techniques has facilitated some definition of the 7q22 region, with identification of candidate genes for further functional analysis. It is becoming clear that there will be more than one gene on chromosome 7 involved in the leukaemic process and with the definition of these genes it may be possible to look for associations with different phenotypes and prognosis. As for the reason for chromosome 7 showing a particular predisposition to total or partial loss we may speculate that the DNA sequence and structure may confer a 'fragility' on the chromosome. A greater understanding of the DNA structure of the long arm may provide real insight into the mechanisms of leukaemia. We would like to speculate in the long term that this could lead to the ability to screen for leukaemia susceptibility and avoidance of 'inducers' in those at risk.\n",
      "The association between childhood leukaemia and exposure to pesticides was examined in a population-based case-control study conducted in Lower Saxony, Northern Germany. Between July 1988 and June 1992, 219 newly diagnosed cases were identified, of whom 173 participated in the study. Two sex- and age-matched control groups were recruited: local controls from the same communities as the newly diagnosed cases of leukaemia and state controls from other randomly selected communities in Lower Saxony. An additional study group consisted of 175 cases of solid tumours. When the leukaemia cases were compared with the local controls, positive associations with parental occupational exposure, particularly agriculture-related exposure, were observed, which were statistically non-significant. A significant association was found for pesticide use in gardens (odds ratio = 2.52, 95% confidence interval: 1.0-6.1). No positive associations were seen when the leukaemia cases were compared to the state controls, but this finding could be explained by a higher proportion of state controls living in rural areas. In communities with a significantly elevated standardised incidence ratio of childhood leukaemia over the last decade (1984-1993), the prevalence of pesticide use in the garden was 21%, compared with the 10% in other communities. None of the examined risk factors were more common among cases of solid tumours. Our findings add some evidence to the hypothesis that pesticides are a risk factor for childhood leukaemia, and there are good reasons to consider abundant pesticide use in rural areas as a possible cause for clustering of childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "m-BCR chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a rare entity. We report a patient presenting with Philadelphia (Ph)-positive, m-BCR-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who achieved complete remission after induction chemotherapy, but showed a majority of Ph-positive mitoses during this remission. A diagnosis of m-BCR CML was established and the patient was given interferon alpha therapy. This is the first m-BCR CML presenting as ab initio ALL. This report emphasizes the importance of karyotyping Ph-positive ALL during remission so as not to misdiagnose CML patients who can benefit from Interferon therapy.\n",
      "Both chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are rare illnesses. Their co-existence has been previously reported, typically with CML following CLL. We report to our knowledge the first case of CLL developing some years after initial diagnosis of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive CML. We provide molecular evidence that CLL arose in a Ph negative clone. The implications of the findings are discussed.\n",
      "We report a case of spontaneous remission of lymphoid blast crisis in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) which returned to chronic phase, without the use of cytostatic chemotherapy, following an episode of viral infection and blood transfusion. Although complete remissions of acute leukaemia have been described, this evolution is extremely rare and has never been reported in CML blast crisis. The role of hypothetical factors leading to such a rare event are briefly discussed.\n",
      "Advances in our understanding of cancer biology have enabled drug development to progress towards better targeted therapies that are both more effective and safer owing to their lack of off-target toxicities. In this regard, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which have the potential to combine the selectivity of therapeutic antibodies with the cytotoxicity of highly toxic small molecules, are a rapidly developing drug class. The complex and unique structure of an ADC, composed of a monoclonal antibody conjugated to a potent cytotoxic payload via a chemical linker, is designed to selectively target a specific tumour antigen. The success of an ADC is highly dependent on the specific properties of its components, all of which have implications for the stability, cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics and antitumour activity of the ADC. The development of therapeutic ADCs, including gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin, provided great knowledge of the refinements needed for the optimization of such agents. In this Review, we describe the key components of ADC structure and function and focus on the clinical development and subsequent utilization of two leukaemia-directed ADCs - gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin - as well as on the mechanisms of resistance and predictors of response to these two agents.\n",
      "Sixty patients were prospectively studied with the aim of analyzing the clinical and laboratory features and outcome of patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in a major referral center in Niger Delta region of Nigeria for 10 years (1995-2005). The peripheral blood, bone marrow cytology, clinical features and stage at diagnosis were studied. Treatment modalities, response to treatment and survival outcome of the patients were analysed. Sixty patients (15 men and 45 women) were seen, with female preponderance (M : F ratio,1 : 3). The CLL incidence was 36.4% of total leukaemias. The median age was 56 years with peak age group at 51-60 years while 15% were below 40 years. Major clinical findings include lymphadenopathy (91.7%), anaemia (58.3%), abdominal swelling (58.3%), and splenomegaly (50%) with 53 patients (88.3%) presenting as International (Binet) stage B and C while only seven patients (11.7%) were seen in stage A. The least clinical presentation includes Richter syndrome in 3.3% of cases and herpes Zoster skin manifestations in two patients (3.3%). There was a strong association between the blood counts at diagnosis and outcome of therapy. The 2-year survival for young (<55 years) and older (>55 years) CLL patients was 27.2% and 28.9%, respectively, which is still very poor because of a number of strong limiting factors. CLL is not rare in Southern Nigeria and its presentations are similar to cases seen worldwide. Contrary to existing literature a female predominance was observed in this study with majority of patients seeking medical intervention late. It is therefore recommended that future research into the genetic make up/HLA typing of patients of African descent is needed to clarify some of the differences observed.\n",
      "Significant orofacial complications of leukaemia in children include lymphadenopathy, spontaneous gingival bleeding, labial and lingual ecchymoses and mucosal petechiae, ulceration, gingival swelling, and infections. The dentist may be the first to notice signs of the illness. Treatment of leukaemia can result in serious orofacial problems which include oral mucositis and ulceration, infections, spontaneous gingival bleeding, neuropathy, xerostomia, and gingival hypertrophy. A prompt diagnosis leading to early intervention can decrease the morbidity and mortality of the disease and its treatment.\n",
      "The relation of brain cancer and mortality from leukaemia to electrical occupations was investigated in a case-control study based on all deaths in 1985 and 1986 in the 16 states in the United States that report occupational data from death certificates to the national vital statistics registry. The case series comprised all 2173 men who died of primary brain cancer (International Classification of Diseases-9 ((ICD-9) code 191) and all 3400 who died of leukaemia (ICD-9 codes 204-208). Each was matched with 10 controls who died of other causes in the same year. Men employed in any electrical occupation had age race adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.7) for brain cancer and 1.0 (95% CI 0.8-1.2) for leukaemia, compared with men in all other occupations. Brain cancer odds ratios were larger for electrical engineers and technicians (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.1-3.4), telephone workers (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), electric power workers (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7), and electrical workers in manufacturing industries (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4). There was some evidence of excess leukaemia among the same groups (ORs of 1.1-1.5) despite absence of an association for all electrical workers. The excess of deaths from brain cancer was concentrated among men aged 65 or older, whereas leukaemia was associated with electrical work only among younger decedents and those with acute lymphocytic leukaemia. These results from a large and geographically diverse population corroborate reports of increased mortality from brain cancer among electrical workers, but gives only limited support to suggestions of excess deaths from leukaemia.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an uncommon complication of patients with essential thrombocythaemia (ET). We report a patient with ET which progressed into AML and who had only received a few days of therapy with hydroxyurea (HU) when diagnosed with ET. This is extremely rare, as in large series no patients who were left untreated for their ET developed this complication. This case supports the theory that AML transformation can be part of the natural history of ET in some cases.\n",
      "T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is an aggressive disease often resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Long lasting remissions with the monoclonal antibody CAMPATH-1H (anti-CD52) have been documented. We describe two unusual T-PLL patients treated successfully first with CAMPATH-1H in whom, at the time of relapse, the cells underwent a phenotypic switch with loss of CD52 expression. In one of them, cytogenetic analysis demonstrated the same chromosome abnormalities in the cells at diagnosis and relapse. The reasons for the immunophenotypic changes are unknown but it is likely that loss of CD52 antigen expression contributed to the resistance to CAMPATH-1H in one of the patients when re-treated.\n",
      "Prolymphocytic leukaemia is an unusual but distinctive variant of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia which generally responds poorly to chemotherapy. Four cases are described to illustrate typical clinical and haematological features and to emphasise the unsatisfactory outcome with combination chemotherapy, radiotherapy and plasma exchange in 3 patients, and to draw attention to the prolonged disease control which followed splenectomy in the fourth. These observations illustrate the relative ease with which the diagnosis can be made and also the difficulties in management, which requires exploration of alternative treatment options.\n",
      "This study aims to investigate the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, anxiety, and depression in patients with hematological malignancies, and to investigate the possible relationship between these symptoms and variables such as demographic data, social support, and quality of life (QOL). We studied 107 patients: 54 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 18 acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), 10 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and 25 multiple myeloma (MM). Demographic data were collected, and three standardized instruments were applied to this group of patients: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Impact of Event Scale (IES), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire of QOL. The results showed a significant percentage of patients presenting with symptoms: 13% had high levels of intrusive thoughts, 20.5% had high levels of anxiety, and 16.8% had high levels of depression. Patients with MM had the lowest QOL scores in the EORTC physical functioning subscale. Patients under intravenous chemotherapy treatment had a higher level of anxiety than the monitoring patients. Patients with recent diagnosis had a level of intrusion symptoms (IES) relevantly higher than the others. The unemployed patients and those with lower social support had levels of stress, anxiety, and depression significantly higher than the others. Our results confirm the high incidence of intrusion, avoidance, anxiety, and depression in patients with hematological malignancies and highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary staff to complement the treatment of these patients, including psychosocial assistance.\n",
      "Early in the 1980s three categories of T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were recognized: CD4+ CD8- knobby type, CD4- CD8+ azurophilic type and CD4+ CD8- adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) type. Both azurophilic and ATL types were later shown to be distinctive disorders, whereas the knobby type has been largely neglected and even considered non-existent by some authors. In this report we describe two patients with leukaemia of CD3+ CD4+ CD8- post-thymic T lymphocytes presenting with marked lymphocytosis, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. We believe that CLL of the post-thymic T-lymphocytes is a distinct entity, and merits a separate designation from other T-cell leukaemias.\n",
      "A 70-year-old man from an endemic area of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) developed rapid generalized lymphadenopathy and abdominal tumours. The white blood cell count was 198.3 x 10(9)/l with 93% lymphocytes, 66.3% of which expressed large granular lymphocytes (LGLs). Bone marrow and lymph nodes were also infiltrated by LGLs. Surface markers were positive for CD4, CD25 and HLA-DR, and negative for CD3, CD8, CD16, CD56 and CD57. A monoclonal integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA was demonstrated on these LGLs by Southern blot hybridization analysis. This fact indicates that some adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma may morphologically present LGL leukaemia.\n",
      "Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is a form of extramedullary leukaemia (EML). The presence of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) on the surface of the blasts, which is recognized by the CD56 monoclonal antibody, enhances their propensity for tissue penetration. GS within the central nervous system (CNS), in particular within the cerebellum, is extremely uncommon. We review the literature and describe an infant with isolated cerebellar GS relapse, which antedated a CD56+ acute monoblastic leukaemia bone marrow (BM) relapse.\n",
      "In the context of a case control study on the cancer risk for children under five by distance to the nearest nuclear power plant, we collected information on other risk factors in a subset. We present the interview study as if it had been an independent study. Parents of 471 cases with Leukaemia, Lymphoma or CNS (Central Nervous System)-tumour from the German Childhood Cancer Registry, diagnosed at age under 5 in the years 1993-2003, and 1,457 matched controls were to be interviewed. For Leukaemia, 243 cases/604 controls, and for CNS 102 cases/246 controls participated, lymphoma cases were too few. Questions related to social status, ionizing radiation, pregnancy and birth, immune system, and selected toxins. The analysis is exploratory in nature; variables were selected by backward elimination. For leukaemia we found a significant protective effect of social contacts (OR=0.50, 95% CI [0.29;0.87]) and a risk for high birth weight (OR=1.96 95% CI [1.12;3.41] comparing >4,000 g to \"normal\"). We could not reproduce other associations reported in the literature such as a negative association with allergies. For CNS tumours we found a significant protective effect of social contacts (OR=0.30 95% CI [0.13;0.72]), of pesticides and herbicides (OR=0.39 95% CI [0.18;0.83]) and an increased risk for low birth weight (p=0.0232). This study on risk factors for childhood leukaemia and brain tumours is relatively small and exploratory. We could reproduce some major associations reported in the literature (leukaemia: social contacts and high birth weight) but not others. Some observations may be reporting artefacts or self selection artefacts.\n",
      "Despite extensive investigation into mechanisms of drug resistance in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the aetiology of therapeutic resistance is unclear. We found that five leukaemia cell lines (K562, HL-60, CEM. CEM induced to overexpress bcl-2, and REH) displayed parallel sensitivity to four antileukaemia drugs with different mechanisms of action, with K562 generally being the least sensitive and REH being the most sensitive. The amount of spontaneous apoptosis in the cell lines after serum-free culture paralleled their drug sensitivity: K562 cells displayed the least apoptosis at 24h (2.50 +/- 0.24%) and REH the most (24.47 +/- 8.22%). The extent of spontaneous apoptosis of leukaemic blasts from 39 patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML also correlated with the success of the intensive, infusional cytarabine-based induction therapy. There was a median of 19.5% (range 3.6-64%) apoptotic AML cells after 24 h of serum-free culture in patients who entered a complete remission compared with 4.2% (1.8-7.0%) apoptotic AML cells in patients who did not achieve a complete remission (P = 0.0007). Thus, inhibited apoptosis was associated with both in vitro and in vivo pan-resistance to antileukaemic chemotherapy. The cause of inhibited apoptosis in AML is probably a function of interactions among multiple signals that influence apoptosis. Assessment of spontaneous apoptosis may serve as an important prognostic factor for AML.\n",
      "The use of peripheral blood rather than marrow has potential advantages for monitoring minimal residual disease during the treatment of leukaemia. To determine the feasibility of using blood, we used a sensitive polymerase chain reaction method to quantify leukaemia in the blood and marrow in 35 paired samples from 15 children during induction treatment. Leukaemic cells in the blood ranged from 1.1 x 10(-2) to < 9.4 x 10(-7) leukaemic cells/total cells, corresponding to 1.3 x 10(7) to < 2 x 10(3) leukaemic cells/l. In 15 paired samples, leukaemia could be quantified in both tissues and in 20 paired samples, leukaemia was not detected in one or both tissues so that only upper level limits could be set. In the former 15 pairs, the level of leukaemia in peripheral blood was directly proportional to that in marrow but was a mean of 11.7-fold lower. Leukaemia in blood was detected in 10/12 pairs in which the level in marrow was > 10(-4), but in only two of 13 pairs in which the level in marrow was < 10(-5). Patients studied at multiple time-points showed parallel declines in the number of leukaemic cells in both tissues. The results showed that leukaemia could be monitored in peripheral blood during induction therapy, and quantitative considerations based on the results suggest that monitoring of blood during post-induction therapy may be of value in detecting molecular relapse.\n",
      "We conducted a prospective study in order to compare ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of liver foci in patients with acute leukaemia and clinical suspicion of hepatic candidiasis. 28 adult patients fulfilling set entry criteria after recovery from neutropenia were studied. Lesions in the liver were detected by at least one imaging modality in 21 patients: by ultrasonography in 7 (33% of detected cases), computed tomography in 12 (57%) and by magnetic resonance imaging in 20 patients (95%). Magnetic resonance imaging was significantly more sensitive than ultrasonography (p<0.001) and computed tomography (p<0.02). The difference between computed tomography and ultrasonography was not statistically significant (p=0.1). Invasive procedures performed in 10 patients provided definite proof of candidiasis in 5 patients, and nodes on the liver surface, compatible with yeast infection, were seen during laparoscopy in 3 other patients without proof of fungal infection. We confirm that magnetic resonance imaging is superior to ultrasonography and computed tomography in imaging liver foci in leukaemic patients recovering from neutropenia with persistent non-specific signs of infection or hepatic involvement.\n",
      "Secondary leukaemia has rarely been reported as a complication of autologous stem cell transplantation for AML. We report two cases of AML who presented with well-characterised cytogenetic abnormalities at presentation: t(8;21) and t(15;17) respectively, and who, after achieving complete morphological and cytogenetic remissions post-autograft, developed MDS/AML associated with monosomy 7. This secondary change is most frequently seen following alkylating agent therapy for solid tumours. The secondary leukaemia seen in our patients may thus be due to exposure of the residual stem cells to the alkylating agents used in the transplant conditioning.\n",
      "GOALS OF WORK: Communication with parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer poses a number of problems, mostly due to the psychological effects of parental trauma. This study was designed to answer the following questions: How can we sustain the flow of communication with parents of children newly diagnosed with leukaemia so that it may become easier and more effective? What should we say to gather more reliable information from parents? How can we help empower their coping strategies? PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed 4880 conversational turns in individual conversations carried out between psychologists and 21 parents of children with leukaemia. The conversations were aimed at gathering information of the families' daily routines. Dialogues were audiotaped and fully transcribed. The type and frequency of speech acts present in each turn were coded along 18 categories by two independent judges (inter-rater agreement, Cohen Kappa =0.73). MAIN RESULTS: The parental speech acts expressing emotion in various ways go up to 58% of the total number of their speech acts. The lag-sequential analysis showed that such expressions are not associated with any of the interviewer speech act. The same analysis showed that, by contrast, the interviewer style has an effect upon the cognitive aspects of parents' conversation. Support of hope favoured parental ability to identify their coping strategies. Explicit requests, confirmations such as \"sure\" and key words summarizing parents' viewpoints are followed by parental factual and objective narratives. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, a few practical recommendations for health care professionals are given in order to better communicate with parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer.\n",
      "There is no clear consensus regarding the optimal management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Many patients are diagnosed at an advanced age and will die with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but of other unrelated causes. A significant minority are diagnosed at an earlier age, or with more aggressive disease, and despite chemotherapy, are likely to die of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The infusion of autologous or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cells, following a variety of conditioning regimes, offers the possibility of longer remissions or even cure. We explore the key questions facing clinicians in this field: Who is it best to transplant? When is it best to transplant? How is it best to transplant?\n",
      "To explore the potential efficacy of l-asparaginase treatment in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients, we studied the in vitro resistance of French-American-British (FAB) subtypes of childhood AML to l-asparaginase using a methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium assay. We tested leukaemic cells obtained from 177 common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (cALL) and 228 AML children at diagnosis. The median 70% lethal dose of l-asparaginase (LD70asp) (U/ml) was 0.46 in the cALL and 6.70 in the AML samples. The median LD70asp among each FAB subtype of AML was 0.76 (M0), 0.46 (M1), 10.00 (M2), 10.00 (M3), 1.18 (M4), 1.35 (M5) and 10.00 (M7). Type M3 samples had the highest LD70asp. The LD70asp of the M2 samples was significantly higher than that of the M1, M4 and M5 samples. When the LD70asp values were classified as low (0.016-0.159), intermediate (0.16-1.59) or high (1.6-10.00), the frequency of low, intermediate or high LD70asp among the M1 samples were similar to those among the cALL samples. In conclusion, cells from AML types M1, M4 and M5 were relatively sensitive to l-asparaginase, and M1 cells were as sensitive as those of cALL, suggesting that l-asparaginase treatment may be effective for these subtypes of AML.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Although numerous antibodies suitable for use on paraffin wax embedded sections are available for the subtyping of acute leukaemia (acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)) in bone marrow biopsy sections, unequivocal identification of the cell line involved is sometimes impossible. METHODS: Forty eight formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded bone marrow biopsy specimens that had been decalcified in EDTA were investigated, including 42 thought to exhibit ALL on the basis of bone marrow smears. Five specimens exhibited AML and one biphenotypic leukaemia, as diagnosed immunohistochemically in bone marrow biopsies. Immunostaining was performed with antibodies against relatively specific B and T cell antigens. The blasts were investigated for rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) genes. RESULTS: Amplifiable DNA was obtained from all 48 specimens. An IgH gene rearrangement was detected in 20 of 23 c-ALL specimens. Four of seven T cell ALL (T-ALL) specimens had a TCR-gamma gene rearrangement, and the one B cell ALL (B-ALL) specimen exhibited a clonal IgH gene. Three of four cases of unclassifiable ALL could be assigned to the B cell lineage on the basis of gene rearrangement analysis. Seven cases originally diagnosed in smears as ALL were rediagnosed as AML (n = 5) or biphenotypic leukaemia (n = 2) because of immunohistochemical reactivity for myeloperoxidase or lysozyme. Two of these AML cases and two of three cases of biphenotypic leukaemia exhibited a monoclonal IgH gene rearrangement. CONCLUSIONS: Acute leukaemia can be subtyped in bone marrow sections with a limited panel of antibodies suitable for use on paraffin wax embedded sections (against CD3, CD10, CD20, CD79a, myeloperoxidase, and lysozyme). In patients with ALL and a diagnostically equivocal immunophenotype, gene rearrangement analysis might indicate whether the B or T cell lineage is involved.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Over the last 25 years clinical trials have reported improvement in the management of leukaemia leading to improved survival. In this paper we present the population-based survival patterns of leukaemia over the last two decades from East Anglia. METHODS: Data on leukaemia from the East Anglian cancer registry were analysed to study survival based on age and time period at diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier survival was calculated for children (ages 0-14) and for adults (ages 15+) separately, for the main leukaemia sub-types. RESULTS: A total of 2044 males and 1524 females with leukaemia were registered between 1971 and 1990, of whom 158 (7.7 per cent) and 123 (8.1 per cent) were aged less than 15 years at diagnosis. In children, five-year survival was significantly better for females for all leukaemias (p = 0.02) and for acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) (p < 0.01). Infants and older children had the worst prognosis as compared with children aged 2-9 years. Analysis by quinquennium of diagnosis showed a highly significant improvement in survival (p < 0.00001) for children with ALL in the later decade (1981-1990). In adults, patients with lymphoid leukaemia survived better as compared with the myeloid subtypes (p < 0.0001). Analysis by year of diagnosis in five-year calendar period showed a significant improvement in survival for acute myeloid leukaemia (p < 0.01), chronic myeloid leukaemia (p < 0.05), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (p < 0.05) and for the four types together (p < 0.001). Survival decreased with age for each subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Age is an important predictor of survival. There was a significant improvement in survival with time for all subtypes except ALL in adults.\n",
      "A group of 15 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was studied prospectively to analyse the impact of the pretreatment DNA labelling indices of the blast cells. Patients with labelling indices less than 5% did significantly worse than those with labelling indices greater than 5%: the 60-week disease-free survival of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and labelling indices greater than 5% was 80%, whereas that for patients with labelling indices less than 5% was 24%, P less than 0.05. In addition, three patients with acute leukaemia and DNA labelling indices of 0%, so-called G-0 acute leukaemias, are described: all of them had refractory forms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with a very poor outcome to treatment.\n",
      "PURPOSE: This paper reviews and reassesses the internationally accepted niches or 'targets' in bone marrow that are sensitive to the induction of leukaemia and primary bone cancer by radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The hypoxic conditions of the 10 μm thick endosteal/osteoblastic niche where preleukemic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) reside provides a radioprotective microenvironment that is 2- to 3-fold less radiosensitive than vascular niches. This supports partitioning the whole marrow target between the low haematological cancer risk of irradiating HSC in the endosteum and the vascular niches within central marrow. There is a greater risk of induced bone cancer when irradiating a 50 μm thick peripheral marrow adjacent to the remodelling/reforming portion of the trabecular bone surface, rather than marrow next to the quiescent bone surface. This choice of partitioned bone cancer target is substantiated by the greater radiosensitivity of: (i) Bone with high remodelling rates, (ii) the young, (iii) individuals with hypermetabolic benign diseases of bone, and (iv) the epidemiology of alpha-emitting exposures. Evidence is given to show that the absence of excess bone-cancer in atomic-bomb survivors may be partially related to the extremely low prevalence among Japanese of Paget disease of bone. Radiation-induced fibrosis and the wound healing response may be implicated in not only radiogenic bone cancers but also leukaemia. A novel biological mechanism for adaptive response, and possibility of dynamic targets, is advocated whereby stem cells migrate from vascular niches to stress-mitigated, hypoxic niches.\n",
      "Many cellular processes converge on the proteasome, and its key regulatory role is increasingly being recognized. Proteasome inhibition allows the manipulation of many cellular pathways including apoptotic and cell cycle mechanisms. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has enhanced responses in newly diagnosed patients with myeloma and provides a new line of therapy in relapsed and refractory patients. Malignant cells are more sensitive to proteasome inhibition than normal haematopoietic cells. Proteasome inhibition enhances many conventional therapies and its role in leukaemia is promising.\n",
      "The thermal sensitivity of normal myeloid and leukaemic cells was compared using morphology, cytochemistry and cultures of granulocyte-macrophage and leukaemic progenitor cells (GM-CFU and L-CFU). We have clearly demonstrated that blast cells from eight cases of acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) showed greater morphological deterioration and loss of cytoplasmic enzymes with continuous heating at temperatures of 40-43 degrees C than normal marrow mononuclear cells obtained from ten controls. Survival of L-CFU also decreased exponentially with rising temperature whereas GM-CFU were not markedly affected, even at a temperature of 43 degrees C for 30 min. These results suggest that human L-CFU are more sensitive to hyperthermic killing than normal human GM-CFU and that hyperthermia might selectively purge residual leukaemic cells in vitro. Hyperthermia may have a role in clinical autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for acute leukaemia.\n",
      "Our patient is a 36-year-old man referred by his general physician to the Department of Hematology because of mild neutropenia in a routine analysis at work. There was no history of previous diseases, and examination was normal. Blood investigations confirmed the neutropenia and showed elongation of prothrombin time. A bone marrow examination was performed revealing about 10% of myeloblasts on the aspirate smears. A cytogenetic study showed chromosome 16 inversion in all of these cells and tetraploidy only in some of them, which were extremely large in size. According to the revised WHO classification of tumours (2008), the patient was diagnosed as a case of acute myeloid leukaemia with chromosome 16 inversion.\n",
      "There is considerable interest in developing techniques to detect and/or quantify remaining leukaemia cells termed measurable or, less precisely, minimal residual disease (MRD) in persons with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in complete remission defined by cytomorphological criteria. An important reason for AML MRD-testing is the possibility of estimating the likelihood (and timing) of leukaemia relapse. A perfect MRD-test would precisely quantify leukaemia cells biologically able and likely to cause leukaemia relapse within a defined interval. AML is genetically diverse and there is currently no uniform approach to detecting such cells. Several technologies focused on immune phenotype or cytogenetic and/or molecular abnormalities have been developed, each with advantages and disadvantages. Many studies report a positive MRD-test at diverse time points during AML therapy identifies persons with a higher risk of leukaemia relapse compared with those with a negative MRD-test even after adjusting for other prognostic and predictive variables. No MRD-test in AML has perfect sensitivity and specificity for relapse prediction at the cohort- or subject levels and there are substantial rates of false-positive and -negative tests. Despite these limitations, correlations between MRD-test results and relapse risk have generated interest in MRD-test result-directed therapy interventions. However, convincing proof that a specific intervention will reduce relapse risk in persons with a positive MRD-test is lacking and needs testing in randomized trials. Routine clinical use of MRD-testing requires further refinements and standardization/harmonization of assay platforms and results reporting. Such data are needed to determine whether results of MRD-testing can be used as a surrogate end point in AML therapy trials. This could make drug-testing more efficient and accelerate regulatory approvals. Although MRD-testing in AML has advanced substantially, much remains to be done.\n",
      "The notion that inherited predisposition contributes to the development of haematological malignancies is generally thought of as being a relatively new idea. However, Videbaek made a clear enunciation of such a hypothesis in 1947, from a study of tumour incidence in relatives of patients with different leukaemias. To gain further insight into inherited susceptibility to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), we followed up the descendants of Videbaek 'Pedigree 14' series of families. Using the Danish medical and pedigree databases, complete tracing of 222 descendants of the original 57 family members was achieved. To date, 10 family members have been diagnosed with CLL, one with T-cell lymphoma and 17 with nonhaematological cancers, including five with breast cancer. The detailed follow up of this family provides further support for inherited predisposition to CLL and illustrates the value of follow-up studies of previously published family material for genetic analyses.\n",
      "Next generation sequencing (NGS) based technology has contributed enormously to our understanding of the biology of myeloid malignancies including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Assessment of clinically important mutations by NGS is a powerful tool to define diagnosis, determine prognostic risk, monitor measurable residual disease and uncover predictive mutational markers/therapeutic targets, and is now a routine component in the workup and monitoring of haematological disorders. There are many technical challenges in the design, implementation, analysis and reporting of NGS based results, and expert interpretation is essential. It is vital to distinguish relevant somatic disease associated mutations from those that are known polymorphisms, rare germline variants and clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) associated variants. This review highlights and addresses the technical and biological challenges that should be considered before the implementation of NGS based testing in diagnostic laboratories and seeks to outline the essential and expanding role NGS plays in myeloid malignancies. Broad aspects of NGS panel design and reporting including inherent technological, biological and economic considerations are covered, following which the utility of NGS based testing in AML and MDS are discussed. In current practice, patient care is now strongly shaped by the results of NGS assessment and is considered a vital piece of the puzzle for clinicians as they manage these complex haematological disorders.\n",
      "PURPOSE: An 8-year-old girl with a history of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) presented with bilateral ocular discomfort, conjunctival injection, photophobia, and epiphora. METHODS: Clinical examination and high-frequency ultrasound showed bilateral epibulbar tumours. RESULTS: Granulocytic sarcomas were suspected and leukaemic infiltration was confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy based cytopathologic examination. CONCLUSIONS: Epibulbar granulocytic sarcoma in AML is rare (particularly in a child). We describe the first high-frequency ultrasound images and illustrate the use of a minimally invasive fine-needle aspiration biopsy technique to confirm our diagnosis.\n",
      "We report three consecutive cases of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) that were diagnosed within a 4-month period. This unexpected sequence of events was made all the more notable following our discovery of co-incidental geographic, social, and occupational factors that linked them together. Our data strongly suggests that environmental agents may play a greater role in the aetiology of APML than is commonly perceived.\n",
      "Chemotherapy combined with total-body irradiation (TBI), a conditioning regimen for bone-marrow transplantation (BMT), causes lesions in the cellular DNA of the patients treated. To understand possible consequences of the DNA damage induced during such treatment, information is required about the nature of the damage, the level of induction and its persistence, and about the importance of the various lesions for cell-lethality and/or mutation induction. Recently, we developed a sensitive immunochemical method to quantify single-strand breaks (SSB) in the DNA of mammalian cells. In addition, a modification of the so-called alkaline elution technique was introduced which allows quantification of SSB together with base damage (SSB+BD). These methods have now been applied successfully to study the in vivo induction and repair of DNA damage in WBC of leukaemia patients who prior to BMT were treated with cyclophosphamide (CY) and received TBI. SSB and SSB+BD were determined after two treatments with CY (60 mg kg-1) followed by TBI (4.5-8.6Gy). The CY treatments gave rise to rather persistent SSB. In addition to these, radiation-induced SSB and SSB+BD could be detected shortly after TBI. However, 105 min after TBI, these SSB could be observed no longer, as a result of rapid repair.\n",
      "Central nervous system (CNS) leukaemia is still a matter of debate and new technologies are required to improve the classic morphological definition. One hundred and sixty-eight cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 31 patients with acute leukaemia were analysed by flow cytometry and conventional cytology. Concordant positive and negative findings were found in 158 samples but 10 produced discrepant results. Cytology seemed to offer more precise information in one CSF sample and flow cytometric accuracy could be demonstrated in five samples. We conclude that flow cytometry is of great help in confirming CNS leukaemia and eliminating other conditions. Therefore, leukaemic patients can benefit from double cytological and flow cytometric CSF studies.\n",
      "We studied the expression of gelatinase-A (MMP-2) and gelatinase-B (MMP-9) in bone marrow aspirates from 54 patients with leukaemia. Specific staining patterns for different leukaemia subtypes are described. Most intresting were findings in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), where MMP-2 staining correlated strongly with prognosis. Three year event-free survival after conventional treatment for patients with MMP-2 positive blast cells was 82%, while all the conventionally treated patients with MMP-2 negative blasts relapsed within 13.5 months. After treatment with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, 3-year event-free survivals were 100% and 80% for MMP-2 positive and negative patients respectively.\n",
      "Unsuccessful cytogenetics (UC) in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treated on different SWOG trials was recently reported to be associated with increased age and dismal outcome. To ascertain whether this holds true also in unselected patients with AML, we retrieved all cytogenetic reports in cases from the population-based Swedish AML Registry. Between 1997 and 2006, 1737 patients below 80 yr of age without myelosarcoma or acute promyelocytic leukaemia received intensive treatment. The frequencies of UC and unperformed cytogenetics (UPC) were 2.1% and 20%, respectively. The early death rates differed between the cytogenetic subgroups (P = 0.006) with the highest rates in patients with UC (14%) and UPC (12%) followed by high-risk (HR) AML, intermediate risk (IR) and standard risk (SR) cases successfully karyotyped (8.6%, 5.9%, and 5.8%, respectively). The complete remission rate was lower in UC and UPC and HR compared with the other risk groups (P < 0.001). The overall five-year survival rates were 25% for UC and 22% for UPC, whereas the corresponding frequencies for SR, IR and HR AML patients without UC and UPC were 64%, 31% and 15%, respectively. In conclusion, lack of cytogenetic data translates into a poor prognosis.\n",
      "We assessed lineage involvement by NUP98 translocations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Single cell analysis by FICTION (Fluorescence Immunophenotype and Interphase Cytogenetics as a Tool for Investigation of Neoplasms) showed that, despite diverse partners, i.e. NSD1, DDX10, RAP1GDS1, and LNP1, NUP98 translocations always affected a CD34+/CD133+ hematopoietic precursor. Interestingly the abnormal clone included myelomonocytes, erythroid cells, B- and T- lymphocytes in MDS/AML and only CD7+/CD3+ cells in T-ALL. The NUP98-RAP1GDS1 affected different hematopoietic lineages in AML and T-ALL. Additional specific genomic events, were identified, namely FLT3 and CEBPA mutations in MDS/AML, and NOTCH1 mutations and MYB duplication in T-ALL.\n",
      "The data we review indicate that in adults with ALL in first remission intensive chemotherapy and radiation given before a transplant is more effective in eradicating leukaemia than current chemotherapy. This is not so in adults with AML in first remission where more intensive therapy does not reduce the likelihood of relapse. Furthermore, leukaemia relapse because of re-infused leukaemia cells is an important issue in autotransplants for ALL. Whether re-infusing leukaemia cells would be important in AML were more effective pretransplant therapy developed is unknown. Presently, there appears to be little sense to test in vitro approaches to remove leukaemia cells in autotransplants for AML because efficacy cannot be evaluated. (A randomized trial is an exception but would not be expected to show a difference.) Another conclusion is that attempts to induce GVHD in autotransplant recipients, such as by using cyclosporine post-transplant (Jones et al, 1989), are more likely to succeed in AML than ALL since the impact of GVHD is substantially greater (Horowitz et al, 1990). However, the GVHD-related antileukaemia effect in AML is associated with chronic GVHD whereas cyclosporine treatment of autotransplant recipients results in acute GVHD. Also, attempts to separate clinical and antileukaemia effects of GVHD were unsuccessful (Sullivan et al, 1989). Another caution is that in AML we detected an immune antileukaemia effect distinct from GVHD (termed GVL) only after HLA-identical sibling transplants. Since GVL was absent in twins it is unlikely to operate after autotransplants. In summary, there is sense in studying autotransplants in adults with acute leukaemia in first remission. However, there are currently no convincing data that autotransplants are superior to current therapy. More intensive treatment seems effective in ALL; the focus should be on increasing the antileukaemia efficacy of pretransplant therapy and on attempts to remove leukaemia cells from the graft. In AML, there is no evidence that more intensive therapy is more effective. This problem needs resolution before evaluating attempts to remove leukaemia cells from the graft. The best place to test new pretransplant regimens is in twins and recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants without GVHD. The data and ideas we review and discuss should be useful in planning clinical trials.\n",
      "We describe a 44-yr-old Japanese woman with persistent polyclonal T-cell proliferation and recalcitrant clinical course of haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). T cells bearing alphabeta T-cell receptors (TCR) expressed increased amounts of CD95 and of CD45RO, which are phenotypically memory T cells. The TCR repertoire was broad and diverse. Regardless of CD95 expression, these cells were resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis. Aggressive natural killer cell leukaemia (ANKL) without an association with Epstein-Barr virus was detected 1 month after therapeutic splenectomy that followed 3 yr of immunosuppressive therapy against HPS. The immunophenotype of these leukaemia cells was CD56, CD16(dim), CD7, CD45RA and they expressed some CD2, CD8 and HLA-DR. Moreover, hyperdiploid clones with complex chromosomal abnormalities were also detected. Latent NK-cell malignancy seemed to cause the CD95-resistant memory T-cell proliferation and splenectomy resulted in overt ANKL progression. There should be careful consideration of the risks versus benefits of splenectomy in HPS, in light of the possibility of fatal leukaemia/lymphoma progression.\n",
      "This retrospective case-control study of 56 cases and 56 controls measured extra low frequency (ELF) electric and magnetic fields between 2000 h and 0800 h in the bedplaces of children with leukaemia. Mean ELF electric field (E-field) levels found in case homes of 13.9 Vm-1 (SD: 13.6) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) compared with only 7.3 Vm-1 (SD: 12.9) in controls matched for age and sex. Moreover, applying conditional logistic regression, a dose-response relationship emerged between E-field exposure and incidence: above 20 Vm-1 the relative risk was 4.69 (95% CI: 1.17-27.78; P = 0.025), whereas at levels of 10-19 Vm-1 it was 2.40 (95% CI: 0.79-8.09) and at levels of 5-9 Vm-1 it was only 1.46 (95% CI: 0.47-5.10). By contrast, similar readings of the rms ELF magnetic field found no significant case-control differences: mean levels in cases' homes of 0.070 microT (SD: 0.070) compared with 0.057 microT (SD: 0.038) in controls. Although there were imperfections in the study design, it is concluded that the importance of the E-field may have been overlooked in epidemiological studies to date.\n",
      "There is a long-standing interest in the possible role of mitochondria in malignancy. We sought to discover whether amplification of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) occurred in leukaemia, and found it was often remarkably amplified in the blast cells of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We used gene dosage experiments to quantify the amount of mtDNA relative to nuclear DNA. DNA extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes or bone marrow of healthy individuals or patients was simultaneously hybridized with a probe for the mitochondrial genome and a control probe for the renin gene on human chromosome 1. Comparative densitometric ratios of approximately 1 were obtained between the two signals in 20 normal control peripheral blood samples. In contrast, comparative ratios in the range of 2-50 were observed in 25 AML samples and 13 of these showed 8-fold or greater amplification of mtDNA relative to normal peripheral blood controls. An additional four cases of AML were investigated at both presentation and remission and showed 3-10-fold amplification of mtDNA at presentation, but no amplification when in clinical remission. 18 cases of chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) were also studied in chronic phase and showed mtDNA dosage levels equivalent to normal peripheral blood controls. However, 8/9 CGL patients showed mtDNA amplification during transformation from chronic phase. We conclude that amplification of mtDNA is an invariable feature of acute myeloid leukaemia and that it may be a useful marker for detecting transformation of CGL.\n",
      "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) includes a heterogeneous group of clonal haematological stem cell disorders characterized by dysplasia, cytopenias, ineffective haematopoiesis, and an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is also called secondary AML (sAML). Approximately one-third of patients with MDS will progress to sAML within a few months to a few years, and this type of transformation is more common and rapid in patients with high-risk MDS (HR-MDS). However, the precise mechanisms underlying the evolution of MDS to sAML remain unclear. Currently, chemotherapy for sAML has minimal efficacy. The only method of curing patients with sAML is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT). Unfortunately, only a few patients are appropriate for transplantation because this disease primarily affects older adult patients. Additionally, compared to de novo AML, sAML is more difficult to cure, and the prognosis is often worse. Therefore, it is important to clarify the molecular mechanisms of the progression of MDS to sAML and to explore the potent drugs for clinical use. This review will highlight several molecular mechanisms of the progression of MDS to sAML and new therapeutic strategies of this disease.\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid leukaemia was revised in 2008. It incorporates newly recognized entities and emphasizes the pivotal role of cytogenetic abnormalities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usability of the WHO classification when applied to a large population-based paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cohort. We included children diagnosed with de novo AML, 0-18 years of age from the Nordic countries and Hong Kong from 1993 to 2012. Data were retrieved from the Nordic Society for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology AML database and patients classified according to the WHO 2008 classification. A successful karyotype was available in 97% of the cases. AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities were present in 262 (41%) and 94 (15%) were classified as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MDS). WHO classifies patients with monosomy 7 and del(7q) into one group. We found that -7 (n = 14) had significantly poorer outcome than del(7q) (n = 11); 5-year event-free survival 26% vs. 67%, (P = 0·02), and 5-year overall survival 51% vs. 90%, (P = 0·04). The largest group was the highly heterogeneous AML not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 280) (44%). In conclusion, the WHO classification allocated 15% to AML-MDS, 44% to NOS and grouped together entities with clearly different outcome, therefore limiting the applicability of the current WHO classification in children with AML.\n",
      "Immunotherapy is currently under active investigation as an adjuvant therapy to improve the overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) by eliminating residual leukaemic cells following standard therapy. The graft-versus-leukaemia effect observed following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation has already demonstrated the significant role of immune cells in controlling AML, paving the way to further exploitation of this effect in optimized immunotherapy protocols. In this review, we discuss the current state of cellular immunotherapy as adjuvant therapy for AML, with a particular focus on new strategies and recently published results of preclinical and clinical studies. Therapeutic vaccines that are being tested in AML include whole tumour cells as an autologous source of multiple leukaemia-associated antigens (LAA) and autologous dendritic cells loaded with LAA as effective antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T cells or natural killer cells is under active investigation. Results from phase I and II trials are promising and support further investigation into the potential of cellular immunotherapeutic strategies to prevent or fight relapse in AML patients.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine if any excess of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was associated with certain striking examples of population mixing in rural Scotland produced by the North Sea oil industry. DESIGN: Details were traced for over 30,000 workers involved in the construction of the large oil terminals in the Shetland and Orkney islands in northern Scotland or employed offshore. Home addresses of the 17,160 Scottish residents were postcoded, integrated with census data, and then classified as urban or rural. Rural postcode sectors, ranked by proportion of oil workers, were grouped into three categories with similar numbers of children but contrasting densities of oil workers. The incidence of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was examined in these rural (and also in urban) categories in the periods 1974-8, 1979-83 and 1984-8. SETTING: Scotland. SUBJECTS: Young people below age 25. RESULTS: A significant excess of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was found in 1979-83 in the group of rural home areas with the largest proportion of oil workers, following closely on large increases in the workforce. The area near the Dounreay nuclear installation, where an excess of leukaemia is already well known, was within the rural high oil category. CONCLUSION: The findings support the infection hypothesis that population mixing can increase the incidence of childhood leukaemia in rural areas. They also suggest that the recent excess in the Dounreay-Thurso area is due to population mixing linked to the oil industry, promoted by certain unusual local demographic factors.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Although studies have consistently found an association between childhood leukaemia risk and magnetic fields, the associations between childhood leukaemia and distance to overhead power lines have been inconsistent. We pooled data from multiple studies to assess the association with distance and evaluate whether it is due to magnetic fields or other factors associated with distance from lines. METHODS: We present a pooled analysis combining individual-level data (29,049 cases and 68,231 controls) from 11 record-based studies. RESULTS: There was no material association between childhood leukaemia and distance to nearest overhead power line of any voltage. Among children living < 50 m from 200 + kV power lines, the adjusted odds ratio for childhood leukaemia was 1.33 (95% CI: 0.92-1.93). The odds ratio was higher among children diagnosed before age 5 years. There was no association with calculated magnetic fields. Odds ratios remained unchanged with adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: In this first comprehensive pooled analysis of childhood leukaemia and distance to power lines, we found a small and imprecise risk for residences < 50 m of 200 + kV lines that was not explained by high magnetic fields. Reasons for the increased risk, found in this and many other studies, remains to be elucidated.\n",
      "Although mutations in p53 are rare in leukaemia, MDM2, the negative regulator of p53, is often overexpressed. Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MDM2 promoter--within the oestrogen-receptor-binding region--resulting in either a G or T allele was shown to affect its transcription, with elevated MDM2 being produced when it is a G allele. Expectedly, SNP309G females were found to be at a higher risk of accelerated onset of cancers. We have therefore analysed, in a pilot study, whether the status of MDM2 SNP309 and p53 codon-72 polymorphism, which was also shown to affect cancer predisposition, would affect cancer risk, onset age, overall survival and response to therapy in Chinese leukaemia patients. p53 SNP was not associated with any of the parameters. However, in contrast to expectations, the MDM2 SNP309G allele was associated with reduced risk of leukaemia. No other association was found between SNP309 and other parameters in both males and females. Thus, the data highlights ethnic differences in the effects of this SNP on cancer risk.\n",
      "Chromosomal rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL, also known as KMT2A) gene on chromosome 11q23 are amongst the most common genetic abnormalities observed in human acute leukaemias. MLL rearrangements (MLLr) are the most common cytogenetic abnormalities in infant and childhood acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and do not normally acquire secondary mutations compared to other leukaemias. To model these leukaemias, we have used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing to induce MLL-AF9 (MA9) chromosomal rearrangements in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell lines and primary cells. By utilizing a dual-single guide RNA (sgRNA) approach targeting the breakpoint cluster region of murine Mll and Af9 equivalent to that in human MA9 rearrangements, we show efficient de novo generation of MA9 fusion product at the DNA and RNA levels in the bulk population. The leukaemic features of MA9-induced disease were observed including increased clonogenicity, enrichment of c-Kit-positive leukaemic stem cells and increased MA9 target gene expression. This approach provided a rapid and reliable means of de novo generation of Mll-Af9 genetic rearrangements in murine haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to produce a cellular model of MA9 leukaemias which faithfully reproduces many features of the human disease in vitro.\n",
      "In the present study we investigated the effects of various doses of gamma-irradiation, followed by induction of granulocytic differentiation with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), on proliferative rate, differentiation capability and oxidative metabolism of leukaemic cells from two different myeloid leukaemia cell lines, HL-60 and PLB-985. Regarding the effects of such combined treatment on the proliferative capabilities of HL-60 and PLB-985 cell lines, we showed that their growth kinetics were similar after 2 Gy gamma-irradiation combined with ATRA. However, with doses >2 Gy, the behaviour of the cell lines differed largely. Indeed, HL-60 appeared to be more radiosensitive than PLB-985 regarding cell viability and proliferation. Besides, whatever dose of irradiation (2, 5 or 10 Gy) was applied, ATRA was still able to induce differentiation of HL-60 and PLB-985 into granulocytes that retained the capacity to produce superoxide anion. The results of these in vitro studies suggest that leukaemia cell lines retain their ability to respond to ATRA, a granulocytic-differentiating inducer following high doses of irradiation. This may have implications for the use of radiation therapy in combination with ATRA for the treatment of extramedullary infiltrations of myeloid leukaemias in humans.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Infection is hypothesised as a contributory cause of childhood immune cell malignancies. Although some have reported associations between individual infections and immune cell malignancies, some could be spurious due to infections caused by malignancies that were already active prior to diagnosis. METHODS: Identified from Taiwan Cancer Registry, ∼3000 children with four commonest immune cell malignancies diagnosed during 2001-2015 at age 1-20 years were identified and matched with 1:10 controls. Using logistic regression, we estimated the time-specific case-versus-control odds ratios of seven common infection presentations in their health records. We also compared recorded unexplained lymph nodes between cases and controls to explore for how long malignancy may be active prior to diagnosis. RESULTS: Unexplained lymph nodes were increasingly recorded months before the diagnosis of childhood leukaemias and years before the diagnosis of childhood lymphomas. When using p < 0.01 as a guide, large case-control differences in infection records were found mostly within 0-2 months prior to the diagnosis (15 out of 28 comparisons). Changes in odds ratios within 3-35 months (2 out of 28 comparisons) and case-control differences beyond 36+ months prior to diagnosis (7 out of 28 comparisons) was relatively small (∼10 % difference in leukaemias). Statistical power varied according to incidence of malignancy, incidence of infection records, and the age distribution. CONCLUSION: Immune cell malignancies were likely to be active some time before the diagnosis. Previous studies using conventional population-based methods may not be able to distinguish any small causal link between infection and immune cell malignancies from spurious associations.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Cranial irradiation for brain tumours or leukaemias has been related to cognitive, endocrine and psychosocial late effects as well as sleep disturbances and increased daytime sleepiness. Studies suggest that cranial irradiation might impact on pineal melatonin secretion. Melatonin is an important regulator in human circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate melatonin secretion, subjective sleep parameters and their interplay in a cohort of cranially irradiated head and brain tumour and leukaemia survivors at least 3 years after radiotherapy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PATIENTS: Thirty-eight adults. MEASUREMENTS: Melatonin secretion was evaluated by measuring its metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin in collected overnight urine. Subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory II was used to screen for depressive symptoms because of their impact on sleep. RESULTS: Patients irradiated in the brain midline had significantly lower melatonin secretion (P = 0.008). Subjects exhibited a high prevalence of sleeping difficulties, daytime sleepiness and depression, with females and overweight subjects particularly affected. Melatonin values and subjective sleep parameters did not correlate with each other or with treatment and most patient variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that radiation exposure to the pineal gland negatively affects melatonin secretion. This lack of pineal melatonin does not influence subjective sleep quality. As melatonin has important antioxidant and cancer-protective effects, further research is necessary to elucidate whether these patients have an increased risk of developing secondary neoplasms and other radiation late effects.\n",
      "The recognition of the curative potential of the graft-versus-leukaemia effect for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) undergoing stem cell transplantation, and the emergence of immunotherapy as a powerful weapon to treat cancer, has spurred the exploration of the immune landscape of AML to apply immunotherapeutic approaches to curing the disease. While current concepts of cancer immunology and immunotherapy have relevance, there are also unique aspects of immune dysregulation in AML to be considered when designing rational immunotherapy for this leukaemia. This is timely because rapid advances in cancer immunobiology, together with technological developments have opened up the field of immunotherapy for malignant disease. Here the current knowledge of AML immunobiology is summarized together with a description of new immunotherapies to counter immunosuppression and immune evasion by AML. Recent advances in treatment with recombinant antibodies, adoptive cell therapy and vaccines and their future promise in AML treatment are reviewed.\n",
      "A 4-year prospective study of de novo acute myeloid leukaemia in patients aged 56 years and over was undertaken in the Northern Region of England (population 3.09 million). The study was conducted to assess the incidence and outcome of treatment in all elderly patients diagnosed between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 1991. Two hundred cases de novo AML were confirmed, giving an incidence of 6.05/10(5) per annum (age specific population) (95% Cl, 5.2-6.9). Acute promyelocytic leukaemia was rare. Erythroleukaemia, monocytic leukaemia and AML with trilineage myelodysplasia were more common than in younger patients. Karyotypic abnormalities classically associated with response to therapy were present in only six of 91 patients where cytogenetic data was available. Treatment was at the discretion of the physician in charge: if given, specific treatment was recorded and clinical outcome assessed. Only 84 (42%) of patients received treatment with curative intent. Forty-four of 84 achieved a complete remission, usually of brief duration. A normal karyotype in leukaemic cells was associated with a survival advantage in this group (p < 0.05). Actuarial overall survival at 4 years for the entire group was 2.5%. Even with aggressive treatment, the outcome is poor. The pattern of disease and its lack of response to conventional treatment would support the hypothesis that AML in the elderly may differ biologically from that observed in younger patients. Karyotyping appears to predict those patients likely to benefit from intensive therapy and decisions about management in otherwise fit patients should, if possible, be delayed until a result is obtained. Every effort should be made to give such patients optimal treatment. However, most patients are unsuitable for aggressive treatment and, since long-term survival is rare, cure should not be offered as an inducement to accept such treatment and improving quality of life outside hospital should be the aim of treatment in this group.\n",
      "Up to now there are no data on long-term effects of allogeneic peripheral blood cell transplantation (AlloPBPCT). In particular, long term effects on healthy donors by the mobilization procedure which includes the exposition to G-CSF over several days are unknown. Recently the possibility of an increase in risk for acute leukaemia in this cohort has been discussed. Systematic long-term safety monitoring for AlloPBPCT donors cannot be adequately planned without agreeing on a both relevant and reasonably pessimistic hypothetical size of the increased leukaemia risk to be detected if present. Using data on leukaemia after treatment for Hodgkin disease as example it is argued that a) excess leukaemia cases should be expected to occur predominantly between 2 and 10 years after the leukaemogenic event and b) a reasonably pessimistic guess would expect about 0.5% leukaemia cases at 10 years in AlloPBPCT donors. Such a tenfold increase over the general population 10 year leukaemia incidence would be relevant, but require long-term follow up of several thousands of donors to demonstrate or exclude. In conclusion, safety monitoring for AlloPBPCT donors can only be organized on an international scale.\n",
      "Given its myeloid-restricted expression, myeloperoxidase (MPO) is typically used for lineage assignment (myeloid vs. lymphoid) during acute leukaemia (AL) diagnostics. In the present study, a robust flow cytometric definition for MPO positivity was established based on the standardised EuroFlow protocols, the standardised Acute Leukaemia Orientation Tube and 1734 multicentre AL cases (with confirmed assay stability). The best diagnostic performance was achieved by defining MPO positivity as ≥20% of the AL cells exceeding a lymphocyte-based threshold. The methodology employed should be applicable to any form of standardised flow cytometry.\n",

      "T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is a rare form of mature T-cell leukaemia that is generally resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Mice transgenic for MTCP1 develop leukaemia similar to human T-PLL, providing a model useful for testing therapeutics. We here evaluated the potential effectiveness of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in murine T-PLL. In vitro, ATO consistently reduced the viability of murine T-PLL cells at a clinically achievable concentration (1 micromol/l). The percentage of viable cells after 24 h was 77 +/- 4%, 56 +/- 6%, 31 +/- 7% with 0 micromol/l, 0.5 micromol/l and 1 micromol/l ATO respectively. ATO cytotoxicity was enhanced by ascorbic acid (125 micromol/l). Mice were then treated with ATO (5 microg/g/d intra peritoneally, 5 d per week) or saline for 4 weeks, starting 14 d after tumoral engraftment. The appearance of lymphocytosis and splenomegaly was delayed in the group treated with ATO and survival was significantly prolonged (mean survival in days: 57.6 +/- 0.8 for ATO versus 45 +/- 0 for saline, P < 10-4). No additional effect was observed in vivo by combining ATO with ascorbic acid (500 microg/g/d, 5 d per week, intra peritoneally). These findings provide support for clinical trials to test therapeutic effects of ATO for human T-PLL.\n",
      "Bone marrow necrosis, an uncommon finding in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, has previously been regarded as a poor prognostic feature. It has been associated with difficulty in establishing the diagnosis, a low rate of remission as well as short remission duration. We report a case of bone marrow necrosis in a girl with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and good prognostic features who attained complete remission uneventfully and will discuss previous reports of this association in the literature.\n",
      "Two reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods to detect the AML1/ETO rearrangement in the M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia those of Downing et al. (Blood 1993; 81: 2860-5) and Satake et al. (Br J Haematol 1995; 91: 892-8) were evaluated. Bone marrow samples, one at diagnosis and two in complete remission from a patient with M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia, with t(8;21), were analysed using both methods. The Kasumi-1 cell line was used as a positive control and a patient with M3 subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia as a negative control. To confirm the feasibility of Satake method a group of 35 patients with subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia at diagnosis were studied. The method of Downing requires Southern blotting and hybridization with a specific probe because it often generates non-specific amplification products. By contrast, the method of Satake yields only a single amplification product, using one single round of PCR in samples at diagnosis, or two rounds in complete remission samples. The sensitivity of this method allows the detection of a single Kasumi-1 cell in 10(6) normal cells. The AML1/ETO rearrangement was observed in 5 of the 35 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia at diagnosis (14.3%) and in 3 of the 14 cases of M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia (21.4%). The two remaining positive cases corresponded to the acute myeloid leukaemia subtypes M4 and M6. The results indicate that the method of Satake better meets the requirements of the clinical laboratory due to its greater simplicity, specificity, sensitivity and feasibility, thus making it more appropriate for use in diagnosing and monitoring minimal residual disease.\n",
      "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using antibodies specific for histone modifications is a powerful technique for assessing the epigenetic states of cell populations by either quantitative PCR (ChIP-PCR) or next generation sequencing analysis (ChIP-Seq). Here we describe the procedure for ChIP of histone marks in myeloid leukaemia cell lines and the subsequent purification of genomic DNA associated with repressive and activating histone modifications for further analysis. This procedure can be widely applied to a variety of histone marks to assess both activating and repressive modifications in the context of myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "Relapse is the main cause of treatment failure after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute leukaemia (AL). Post-transplantation minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring enables risk stratification and identifies AL patients at higher risk of relapse. MRD assessment primarily involves the determination of leukaemia-associated immunophenotypic patterns using multiparameter flow cytometry, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based evaluation of expression levels of leukaemia-related genes (specific reciprocal gene rearrangements and other mutation types). In addition, next generation sequencing and digital PCR may further enrich current MRD detection. Several MRD-directed interventions have demonstrated the ability to reduce the risk of relapse with acceptable treatment-related toxicities. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is the most important intervention for MRD-positive patients, while several modified strategies, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood cells followed by short term immune suppression and escalating dose regimen, further improve the safety and efficacy of DLI. Interferon therapy, targeted drugs, and hypomethylating agents have also been introduced for MRD-directed interventions. Referring to the issues of whether and who would benefit from pre-emptive intervention according to MRD, in this review, we summarized this rapidly evolving area of MRD monitoring and MRD-directed interventions in AL patients after allo-HSCT.\n",
      "The technique of high-dose chemotherapy and bone-marrow transplantation takes advantage of any potential dose-response effect in the treatment of cancer and the ability of infused marrow to circumvent severe myelotoxicity. We report our initial experience of 20 high-dose chemotherapy procedures with busulphan and cyclophosphamide as the treatment regimen. Autologous (14 patients), human leukocyte antigen-matched, sibling-allogeneic (five patients) and identical-twin (one patient) transplantations were performed in patients with leukaemias (12 patients), lymphomas (seven patients) or a germ-cell tumour (one patient). One in-hospital and one late death occurred as a result of the toxicity of high-dose chemotherapy. All evaluable patients demonstrated bone-marrow engraftment and became independent of blood transfusions. Five of six patients who were treated in partial remission or relapse obtained a complete remission. Seven patients have relapsed. Eleven patients currently are alive and disease-free and nine patients have returned to their full-time occupations. High-dose chemotherapy can be undertaken with an over-all morbidity that is similar to that which is experienced during the induction chemotherapy of acute leukaemia.\n",
      "The main goal of disease mapping is to estimate disease risk and identify high-risk areas. Such analyses are hampered by the limited geographical resolution of the available data. Typically the available data are counts per spatial unit and the common approach is the Besag-York-Mollié (BYM) model. When precise geocodes are available, it is more natural to use Log-Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs). In a simulation study mimicking childhood leukaemia incidence using actual residential locations of all children in the canton of Zürich, Switzerland, we compare the ability of these models to recover risk surfaces and identify high-risk areas. We then apply both approaches to actual data on childhood leukaemia incidence in the canton of Zürich during 1985-2015. We found that LGCPs outperform BYM models in almost all scenarios considered. Our findings suggest that there are important gains to be made from the use of LGCPs in spatial epidemiology.\n",
      "A 34-year-old man with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) firstly developed a lymphoid blast crisis of B-cell type. After a second chronic phase which lasted for > 4 years with maintenance chemotherapy of hydroxyurea, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, he developed a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia of TcR-gammadelta+ type. Cytogenetic analysis revealed disappearance of the t(9;22) translocation and appearance of new abnormalities consistent with the diagnosis secondary acute leukaemia. To our knowledge, secondary leukaemia in CML has not previously been reported.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) is a new purine analogue which has been shown to be highly active in lymphoproliferative disorders. In this clinical trial we assessed 2-CDA toxicity and response rate in patients with various haematological malignancies who were heavily pre-treated and mostly refractory to standard treatment regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two refractory patients, 51 relapsing after standard chemotherapy and seven non-pre-treated patients were treated in a non-randomized prospective phase II multicentric study. Their median age was 54 years (range 18-84) and 56 of them were male. Thirty-one had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 11 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 1 prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL), 13 hairy-cell leukaemia (HCL), 2 mycosis fungoides (MF), 3 multiple myeloma, 7 acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), 2 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 6 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in blast crisis, 2 Hodgkin disease, 1 Waldenström macroglobulinemia and 1 Langerhans histiocytosis. 2-CDA 0.1 mg/kg/day was given as a continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days and recycled every 4 weeks. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two courses of 2-CDA were administered to 80 patients, 76 of whom were evaluable for response. A) Toxicity: Myelosuppression: Neutropenia to over 50% of initial value occurred in 46% of patients, thrombocytopenia in 8%, and lymphopenia < 0.5 x 10(9)/l was seen in 41%. Infections occurred in 34/80 patients (43%). The risk of severe infections (WHO grades 3-4) correlated with increasing number of years after first diagnosis (p = 0.01) and low lymphocyte counts on days 1 and/or 14 (p = 0.04); 21 infections were opportunistic. B) Response: 70% patients with lymphoproliferative disorders of low malignancy attained complete or partial response (low-grade NHL 12/16, CLL + PLL 9/12, HCL 13/13, MF 2/2, myeloma 0/3); in patients with AML, ALL, CML in myeloid (n = 4) or lymphoid (n = 2) blast crisis and high-grade lymphoma responses were seen in only 11%. Response was inversely related to the number of pretreatments (p = 0.045). In responding NHL patients the mean lymphocyte count on day 14 of cycle 1 was significantly lower (median 0.6 x 10(9)/l) than that of non-responders (1.2 x 10(9)/l, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: 2-CDA had a high activity even in heavily pretreated and refractory patients with low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders. In contrast to previously published studies, infections, mainly opportunistic, were a serious side effect in our study. In patients with severe lymphopenia at therapy initiation, the value of prophylactic anti-infective treatment should be studied.\n"

      "There has been no documented increase in childhood leukaemia following the Chernobyl accident. However, different forms of childhood leukaemia may not be equally susceptible to radiation carcinogenesis. Infant leukaemia is a distinct form associated with a specific genetic abnormality. Outside the former Soviet Union, contamination resulting from the Chernobyl accident has been highest in Greece and Austria and high also in the Scandinavian countries. All childhood leukaemia cases diagnosed throughout Greece since 1 January 1980 have been recorded. Here we report that infants exposed in utero to ionizing radiation from the Chernobyl accident had 2.6 times the incidence of leukaemia compared to unexposed children (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 5.1; P approximately 0.003), and those born to mothers residing in regions with high radioactive fallout were at higher risk of developing infant leukaemia. No significant difference in leukaemia incidence was found among children aged 12 to 47 months. Preconceptional irradiation had no demonstrable effect on leukaemia risk at any of the studied age groups.\n",
      "Despite the development of modern chemotherapeutic regimens, acute leukaemia remains incurable in the majority of adult patients and potential cure is associated with considerable side effects. Clinical and experimental research of the last two decades has demonstrated that acute leukaemia is the consequence of multiple collaborative molecular aberrations affecting protein kinases and transcriptional regulators induced by genetic alterations and/or epigenetic mechanisms. New technologies have been developed to detect aberrations of the entire (epi)genome of a leukaemic blast that will result in a long list of potential therapeutic targets needing to be functionally validated in cellular and animal leukaemia models. Using these methods, several \"druggable\" protein kinases have been identified. These kinases exert their oncogenic potential not only through expansion of the leukaemic clone, but also by regulating critical interactions of leukaemic stem cells with the microenvironment. Due to the molecular complexity of acute leukaemia, new functional genome-wide screens have been established and may help to identify targets that when blocked result in synthetic lethality of the leukaemic blasts harbouring distinct (epi)genomic lesions. A close interaction between the academic and the pharmaceutical biomedical research will be essential to translate these exciting new molecular findings into improved therapies for acute leukaemia.\n",
      "We report the clinical presentation and the morphological, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular genetic characteristics of a 14 1/2-year-old boy who had French-American-British (FAB) type M1 acute non-lymphocytic (ANLL) leukaemia with a common T-ALL immunological phenotype, with no myeloid associated antigen, either on the membrane or in the cytoplasm. ALL-directed induction therapy induced complete remission.\n",
      "Acromegaly patients are known to have an increased risk of malignancies, especially colonic adenocarcinoma. This may be as a result of the growth-stimulating effect of growth hormone (GH). The clustering of leukaemia in children treated with GH has also caused concern. There have been a few reports of leukaemia in acromegaly patients. We report two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and one patient with acute myeloid leukaemia among 106 acromegaly patients treated over a 15-year period. Two of the cases received radiotherapy as part of their treatment. Adjusted for age and follow-up years, the incidence of leukaemia in this cohort is significantly higher than the general population. The incidence is also higher than would be expected as a result of radiotherapy alone, suggesting that GH may play a synergistic role.\n",
      "Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is a localized tumour of immature granulocytes that is usually associated with myelogenous leukaemia. We report an unusual case of mastoid GS with meningeal extension but no bone marrow involvement on presentation. Histological examination of the surgical specimen and the characteristic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology showing cytoplasmic granulations and Auer bodies led to the diagnosis of GS. Positive cytochemical staining of the immature CSF cells for naphthol-ASD chloroacetate esterase and myeloperoxidase confirmed their myeloid origin. Immunophenotyping did not reveal common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen, cytokeratin, T- or B-cell antigens. The patient underwent surgical resection of the localized tumour, followed by radiation therapy, intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy, as if he had acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). He did not develop AML in the 21 months after the tumour resection. This case emphasizes the value of CSF cytological examination of tumour cells and the use of an immunocytochemical marker for differentiating GS from malignant lymphoma.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer may radically change the daily lives of young survivors, particularly in school. Depending on the sense they derive from the experience of illness, survivors may go through profound transformations in the way they approach life. METHODS: This exploratory study reports on school engagement of cancer survivors by examining their perceptions of benefits and burdens in relation to their illness. Forty-nine young Quebecers, previously diagnosed and treated for leukaemia, completed a questionnaire measuring their school engagement and participated in an interview focusing on the impact of cancer on their lives. Perceptions with regard to the presence and types of benefits and burdens were described and examined in light of participants' characteristics. An analysis of variance explored whether the presence/absence of benefits and burdens were associated with participants' scores regarding school engagement. RESULTS: Most participants mentioned benefits from having had cancer, and in particular benefits at an interpersonal level. Half of the participants mentioned burdens, mainly of a physical and psychological nature. Significant correlations indicated that (i) the older the survivors were, the more likely they were to report benefits in terms of qualities and strengths of character; (ii) the more time had elapsed since their diagnosis, the more survivors were likely to report psychological types of burdens; and (iii) children from single-parent families reported more frequently having appreciated social or recreational activities compared with children from two-parent families. One main effect indicated that school engagement was greater for survivors who perceived the presence of benefits. An interaction effect revealed that the perception of both benefits and burdens predicts the highest scores of school engagement. CONCLUSIONS: While the results reveal the promising potential that an optimistic yet realistic disposition has in regard to school engagement, more research is necessary to further our understanding of such a disposition.\n",
      "Some of potential causes proposed to explain the reported increase of haematological malignancies in childhood during or after the war period in several countries include depleted uranium, chemical pollution and population mixing theory. The aim of this study was to define the population of Croatian children aged 0-14 years who were potentially exposed to each of those risks during the war and to investigate any possible association between the exposure and the incidence of haematological malignancies. The authors analyzed the data reported by the Cancer Registry of Croatia during the pre-war period (1986-1990), war period (1991-1995) and post-war period (1996-1999). In the group of 10 counties potentially exposed to depleted uranium and two counties where chemical war damage occurred, no significant difference in incidence of the studied haematological malignancies was noted in comparison to pre-war period. The incidence of lymphatic leukaemia significantly increased in four counties where population mixing had occurred during the war period, supporting the 'mixing theory'. In those counties, the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma decreased during and after the war. In Croatia as a whole, decreases in incidence of myeloid leukaemias during war and non-Hodgkin lymphoma after the war were noted.\n",
      "A 43 year old woman presented with acute myeloid leukaemia, marked finger and toe clubbing, and a hilar mass. Biopsy of the hilar mass was not technically possible, but it almost certainly represented a granulocytic sarcoma since chemotherapy induced rapid resolution of the mass along with reversal of the clubbing and remission of the leukaemia. Relapse of the leukaemia 21 months later was associated with return of the clubbing. It is hypothesized that an abnormal circulation within the granulocytic sarcoma may have accounted for the development of clubbing.\n",
      "We report stability of a clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in a case of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) relapsing 17 years after completion of first-line therapy. Clonal stability was shown by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the hypervariable CDRIII region of IgH gene. Identically sized products from the original diagnostic and the second presentation samples were obtained and direct sequencing confirmed complete sequence homology. Absence of clonal evolution together with recent reports of persistent minimal residual disease in patients in long-term complete remission, suggests that 'cure' of childhood ALL may be critically dependent on effective immune surveillance to keep such disease below clinically significant levels.\n",
      "Prolymphocytic leukaemia is a rare subtype of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Three such cases were reported here along with clinical details. All these cases were seen in males above 5th decade. These patients showed moderate to massive splenomegaly, inconspicuous lymphadenoapthy in two cases and one with minimal lymphadenopathy. Peripheral smear showed high leukocyte count with more than 55% of prolymphocytes. Bone marrow aspiration showed diffuse involvement and in one with minimal lymphadenopathy, lymphnode aspiration showed prolymphocytes. All the three patients died within a year after diagnosis.\n",
      "An unusually high incidence of leukaemia and recurrent infections was noted in children exposed in utero to domestic water supply contaminated with industrial solvents including trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene and 1,2-transdichloroethylene. Medical and laboratory investigations were carried out on 28 family members of the patients with leukaemia with particular emphasis on the immunological system to determine if they displayed symptoms associated with acute or chronic exposure to these chlorinated hydrocarbons. The principal organ systems affected were neurological, immunological and cardiological. Damage to these systems was found in all subjects by history, physical and laboratory parameters. Damage to the immunological system was manifest by altered ratios of T lymphocyte subpopulations, increased incidence of auto-antibodies, increased infections and recurrent rashes.\n",
      "Myelodysplasia (MDS) and leukaemia following acquired aplastic anaemia has been reported as a rare event occurring in about 5% of patients. Improved results in survival of patients with severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) and subsequent prolonged follow-up created the possibility of evaluating the occurrence of MDS and leukaemia in 38 adult patients with acquired SAA surviving two or more years without bone marrow transplantation. Five patients, age 22, 35, 47, 56, 72 years, two females, three males, all with idiopathic SAA and normal cytogenetic analysis developed a refractory anaemia (RA) 7, 30, 48, 56, 142 months after diagnosis of SAA. In 3/5 RA evolved into an acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) either via a chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (2/3) or via RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) (1/3). Three patients revealed a monosomy 7 during MDS and/or leukaemic phase. One patient died during RA phase without cytogenetic abnormalities. A pattern of evolution could be identified in these patients revealing well-documented SAA - improvement of bone marrow haematopoiesis - dyshaematopoietic features of one or more cell lines with predominance of dyserythropoiesis - RA - RAEB or CMML - AML. These five patients represent more than 10% of all patients surviving at least 2 years. This implies that the risk of developing MDS and leukaemia in SAA patients surviving with autologous marrow, might increase with longer follow-up.\n",
      "Malignant initiation, leukaemic transformation, and disease progression in haematological malignancies involves a series of mutational events in genes involved in normal housekeeping functions of the cell. These acquired genetic changes can lead to either increased proliferation or a decreased rate of apoptosis, thus allowing expansion of the malignant clone. Although leukaemia can arise as a de novo disease, it has become increasingly clear that therapies, including the use of irradiation and/or chemotherapy, can give rise to malignancy. Therapy-associated myelodysplasia (t-MDS) and therapy-associated acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) account for 10-20% of new cases of these diseases. Although these secondary malignancies have been recognised as a clinical entity for nearly 30 years, molecular studies are now pinpointing various regions of the genome that are susceptible to DNA damage by these chemotherapeutic/radiotherapeutic strategies. The detection of new malignancies (both solid tumours and haematological tumours) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is also providing us with some clues to the nature of leukaemogenesis, particularly with the observation that leukaemia can occur in donor cells postallogeneic BMT.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity profile of the combination of fludarabine, high dose cytarabine, idarubicin, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor in refractory relapsed cases of acute leukaemia, a study is being conducted at Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre (AFBMTC) Rawalpindi since January 2003. Data up to June 2004 (early report) is being presented. METHODS: Twelve Patients with refractory/relapsed (Ref/Rel) acute leukaemia (AL) were treated with fludarabine 30 mg/m2 and cytosine arabinoside (AraC) Arac 2 g/m2 for 5 days, idarubicin 10 mg/m2 for 3 days, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor G-CSF 5 micro g/kg from day 0 till neutrophil recovery (ANC > 1.0 x 10(9)/1). Response was evaluated by bone marrow examination on day 20-post chemotherapy. RESULTS: Patients included were refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n=2), relapsed ALL (n = 3), refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n = 3), secondary AML (n=2) relapsed AML (n = 1) and acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) (n = 1). Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 8 (66.6%) patients. Three (25%) patients died of post chemotherapy complications and one patient failed to achieve remission. Out of 8 patients who achieved CR, 4 underwent allogeneic bone marrow transfusion (BMT), 1 is being evaluated for the same, 1 received idorubicin, AraC and etopuside (ICE) and high dose AraC, 1 did not receive further chemotherapy and 1 relapsed two months after remission. Seven patients are still in CR after a median follow up of 8 months (range 3-18). Major complications encountered were diarrhoea, mucositis, toxic ileus, transient hepatic toxicity, fungal and bacterial infections. CONCLUSION: In our experience, FLAG-IDA is well tolerated and effective regimen in relapsed/refractory acute leukaemias. The toxicity is acceptable, enabling most patients to receive further treatment, including transplantation procedures.\n",
      "Leukaemia is the prevailing neoplastic disorder of the hematopoietic system. Epidemiological analyses of the survivors of the Japanese atomic bombings show that exposure to ionising radiation (IR) can cause leukaemia. Although a clear association between radiation exposure and leukaemia development is acknowledged, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. A hemizygous deletion on mouse chromosome 2 (del2) is a common feature in several mouse strains susceptible to radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia (rAML). The deletion is an early event detectable 24h after exposure in bone marrow cells. Ultimately, 15-25% of exposed animals develop AML with 80-90% of cases carrying del2. Molecular mapping of leukaemic cell genomes identified a minimal deleted region (MDR) on chromosome 2 (chr2) in which a tumour suppressor gene, Sfpi1 is located, encoding the transcription factor PU.1, essential in haematopoiesis. The remaining copy of Sfpi1 has a point mutation in the coding sequence for the DNA-binding domain of the protein in 70% of rAML, which alters a single CpG sequence in the codon for arginine residue R235. In order to identify chr2 deletions and Sfpi.1/PU.1 loss, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on a unique panel of 79rAMLs. Using a custom made CGH array specifically designed for mouse chr2, we analysed at unprecedentedly high resolution (1.4M array- 148bp resolution) the size of the MDR in low LET and high-LET induced rAMLs (32 X-ray- and 47 neutron-induced). Sequencing of Sfpi1/PU.1DNA binding domain identified the presence of R235 point mutations, showing no influence of radiation quality on R235 type or frequency. We identified for the first time rAML cases with complex del2 in a subset of neutron-induced AMLs. This study allowed us to re-define the MDR to a much smaller 5.5Mb region (still including Sfpi1/PU.1), identical regardless of radiation quality.\n",
      "The evaluation of treatment and outcome in adult leukaemia requires unselected data. Such data is available from one Health Region in the United Kingdom with an adult population of 3.1 million. In the period July 1982 to December 1989, 676 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 136 of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 141 of chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) were registered. The median survival for AML was 21 weeks and 26% of these patients died within 4 weeks of diagnosis. For ALL, the corresponding figures were 81 weeks and 21%. In CGL, the median survival was significantly different for males and females: 113 weeks and 173 weeks respectively. The 5-year survival in AML was 9%, in ALL, 31% and in CGL, 29% (20% for males, 45% for females). Age at presentation was the single most powerful prognostic factor and probably accounts for survival differences between patients referred to tertiary centres and those treated in district general hospitals. (DGH). Survival may be improving overall as supportive care improves.\n",
      "A major issue in autologous blood stem cell transplantation (ABSCT) for leukaemia is whether peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvests are less contaminated with leukaemic cells than bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC). We compared leukaemic contamination in PBSC harvests and BMMNC, obtained simultaneously, by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of leukaemia-specific chimaeric messenger RNA (mRNA), in three patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), one with Ph-positive acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), and two with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Our two-step PCR method employed 'nested primers' in the second step and can detect one leukaemic blast diluted into 10(6) HL-60 cells. In three of four patients with Ph-positive ALL and AML we detected leukaemic contamination in both PBSC harvests and BMMNC. In the remaining patient with ALL, both PBSC harvests and BMMNC were PCR-negative. Both PBSC harvests and BMMNC from one patient with APL were PCR-positive. In contrast, PBSC harvests from another patient with APL, whose BMMNC could not be obtained because of bone marrow necrosis, were PCR-positive after the first course of consolidation chemotherapy, but became PCR-negative after the second course. The present study does not support the hypothesis that PBSC harvests are less contaminated by leukaemic cells than BMMNC, but suggests that PBSC harvests are contaminated when BMMNC are contaminated.\n",
      "To induce and sustain the leukaemogenic process, MLL-AF4+ leukaemia seems to require very few genetic alterations in addition to the fusion gene itself. Studies of infant and paediatric patients with MLL-AF4+ B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL) have reported mutations in KRAS and NRAS with incidences ranging from 25 to 50%. Whereas previous studies employed Sanger sequencing, here we used next generation amplicon deep sequencing for in depth evaluation of RAS mutations in 36 paediatric patients at diagnosis of MLL-AF4+ leukaemia. RAS mutations including those in small sub-clones were detected in 63.9% of patients. Furthermore, the mutational analysis of 17 paired samples at diagnosis and relapse revealed complex RAS clone dynamics and showed that the mutated clones present at relapse were almost all originated from clones that were already detectable at diagnosis and survived to the initial therapy. Finally, we showed that mutated patients were indeed characterized by a RAS related signature at both transcriptional and protein levels and that the targeting of the RAS pathway could be of beneficial for treatment of MLL-AF4+ BCP-ALL clones carrying somatic RAS mutations.\n",
      "The infections caused by salmonella organisms in children with acute leukaemias are reported. Immunity depression caused by the main diseases as well as by immunosuppressing drugs lead in such cases to generalized infections with these organisms or local infections which were found in the reported cases in the skeletal system, or central nervous system. The course of these infections was very severe, often with lethal outcome.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Between 1990 and 1991 a leukaemia cluster was observed in children living close to the combined site of a nuclear power plant and a nuclear research facility in Elbmarsch, a region in Lower Saxony (Germany). We aim to investigate the prevalence of presumably radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of children in Elbmarsch and children of a control region in order to find out whether there was an uncontrolled release of radioactive material which resulted in a substantial exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The frequency of dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes of the peripheral blood in 42 children in Elbmarsch and 30 children in Plön was investigated. Children in both groups had been permanent residents of the study area. RESULTS: The mean frequency of dicentric and ring chromosomes in Elbmarsch was 14/32580 cells (=0.430 x 10(-3); 95% CI 0.24-0.70 x 10(-3) cells), and in Plön it was 17/24065 cells (=0.706 x 10(-3); 95% CI 0.42-1.10 x 10(-3) cells). CONCLUSIONS: No difference in the frequency of dicentric and ring chromosomes was observed between children in Elbmarsch living close to a combined site of a nuclear power plant and a nuclear research facility and children living in the control area Plön. The power of the study to detect a threefold or higher increase in the aberration frequency was at least 0.86.\n",
      "A new strategy for mapping chromosome translocation breakpoints in relation to known genes has been developed. This approach is based on the amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of specific target sequences from small numbers of microdissected chromosome fragments. This method has been applied to leukaemia-associated translocations affecting the q23 region of chromosome 11. In two independent leukaemias, the t(6;11) translocation was distinguished from the t(9;11) and t(4;11) translocations by demonstrating that the former breakpoint on chromosome 11 lay proximal to the CD3D gene while the latter breakpoints lay distal to CD3D. All three translocation breakpoints were found to lie proximal to ETSI and THYI. The data suggest that although these leukaemia-associated breakpoints on chromosome 11 are cytogenetically identical they may involve disruption of different genes. This approach offers a rapid alternative to mapping by hybridisation of probes either in situ to chromosomes or to somatic cell hybrids containing the appropriate derivative chromosomes.\n",
      "Sending material at regular intervals to laboratories that perform immunophenotyping of leukaemias and lymphomas showed a large variety in the percentage of positive cells between the different laboratories but an agreement in diagnosis of more than 90%. Each laboratory used his own methods but antibody panels and guide-lines for interpretation were standardised. Studies are in progress to answer the question if standardisation in flow cytometry will result in more comparable results.\n",
      "Dysregulation in microRNAs (miRNAs) expression has been observed in distinct acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) subtypes, and their potential as an effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarker is slowly being realized. Certain miRNAs have been found to be associated with various cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities of prognostic significance in AML. Experimental evidences have indicated the potential of modulating miRNA expression as an effective antileukaemic strategy. This has opened a new window for miRNAs-based targeted therapies. In this review, we present results of some studies analyzing the dysregulation in miRNAs expression pattern in paediatric AML and also discuss their use as diagnostic and prognostic markers.\n",
      "Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (T.D.T.) has been measured in the cells of 112 leukaemia patients whose cells were characterised by membrane markers as well as by standard haematological and cytochemical criteria. The concentration of enzyme ranged from 0.1 to 1.4 units/10(8) cells in the bone-marrows of 20 patients with normal marrow or benign marrow hyperplasia. The enzyme level was raised in 30 of 31 patients with untreated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (A.L.L.) whose cells reacted positively with an anti-A.L.L. serum (range 0.9-197, mean 59, units/10(8) cells) and in all 9 patients with thymic A.L.L. (Thy-A.L.L.) (range 1.5-95, mean 36, units/10(8) cells). All but 1 of 17 patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia gave negative results (range 0-1.5, mean 0.60, units/10(8) cells), and T.D.T. was also normal in all 7 bone-marrow samples from patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia (C.G.L.) in the chronic phase. The T.D.T. assay gave a clear distinction between 11 patients with C.G.L. in lymphoid transformation, anti-A.L.L.-serum positive (range 15-226, mean 83, units/10(8) cells), and 12 patients with C.G.L. in myeloblastic transformation, anti-A.L.L.-serum negative (range 0-1.9, mean 0.7, units/10(8) cells). Among 17 patients with otherwise unclassifiable acute leukaemia, 10 gave raised values (range 1.6-113 units/10(8) cells) and 7 gave normal values. It is concluded that the assay of T.D.T. in the peripheral blood or bone-marrow of patients with acute leukaemia is of value in differentiating lymphoid (including non-T non-B and Thy-A.L.L.) from myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In 1991, soil pollution was found around the site of a former chromium-processing factory in Glasgow, Scotland. Levels of chromium in soil were above limits considered as safe, although a risk assessment concluded that population exposure was likely to be below occupational levels. As an excess incidence of leukaemia has been suspected in the area, it was decided to investigate a possible relationship between the pollutant and the illness. METHODS: The ensuing study was descriptive-geographical. In the absence of better data, levels of exposure were assumed to decrease with distance from the centre of the polluted area. Leukaemia and population figures were obtained for each of nine concentric rings by aggregation of data available at the Enumeration District level. The null study hypothesis was that relative risk (as measured by Poisson regression) would not follow a definite trend with distance from the centre. Sex, age and levels of deprivation were taken into account. RESULTS: Relative risks by variables other than distance followed previously known patterns for leukaemia. No evident pattern by distance was found. After regroupings inside the variables, a significant excess of leukaemia was found for intermediate distances from the pollutant. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found of a possible relationship between soil pollution by chromium and leukaemia in the general population. Nonetheless, the excess noticed by the study warrants further research.\n",
      "Lymphohaematopoeitic cancer mortality was examined among 4417 workers at a chemical plant by cumulative and peak benzene exposure. There was little evidence of increasing risk with increasing cumulative exposure for all leukaemias or acute non-lymphocytic leukaemias (ANL), or the other lymphohaematopoeitic cancers with the exception of multiple myeloma. For multiple myeloma, the SMRs were 1.1 (95% CI 0.3 to 2.5) in the non-exposed group, 1.4 (95% CI 0.2 to 5.1) in the <1 ppm-years, 1.5 (95% CI 0.2 to 5.4) in the 1-6 ppm-years, and 2.6 (95% CI 0.7 to 6.7) in the >6 ppm-years group. We found no trends by peak exposures for any of the cancers. However, when peak exposures over 100 ppm for 40 or more days were considered, the observed number of all leukaemias (SMR = 2.7, 95% CI 0.8 to 6.4), ANL (SMR = 4.1, 95% CI 0.5 to 14.9), and multiple myeloma (SMR = 4.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 11.7) were greater than expected. While the observed number of deaths is small in this study, the number of peak exposures greater than 100 ppm to benzene is a better predictor of risk than cumulative exposure. The dose rate of benzene and a threshold for exposure response may be important factors for evaluating lymphohaematopoietic risk.\n",
      "Leukaemia is one of the most prominent late effects of exposure to ionising radiation. We have studied the incidence of leukaemia among 46,988 Swedish patients exposed to iodine-131 (131I) for diagnostic reasons or to treat hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer. The observed number of leukaemias was compared with that expected based on incidence data from the general population. The mean absorbed dose to the bone marrow was estimated as 14 mGy (range 0.01-2.226). 195 leukaemias occurred more than 2 years after exposure, and the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.94-1.25). Similar, but again not significantly, increased risks were seen for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (SIR = 1.08), a malignant condition not found to be increased after irradiation, and for non-CLL (SIR = 1.09). The risk of leukaemia did not vary by sex, age, time, or radiation dose from 131I. One reason for the absence of a radiation effect, other than chance, includes the possible lowering of risk when exposure is protracted over time as occurs with 131I. Excess leukaemia risks of more than 25% could thus be excluded with high assurance in this population of mainly adults. These results should be reassuring to patients exposed to 131I in medical practice and to most individuals exposed to the fall-out from the Chernobyl accident.\n",
      "P-glycoprotein (PGP) lung resistance protein (LRP) and multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) expressions and function were evaluated by flow cytometry in 65 leukaemic patients (38 acute non-lymphocytic leukaemias, eight acute lymphocytic leukaemias, 19 Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukaemias in blastic phase). By using the MRK-16, the LRP-56 and the MRPm6 MoAbs, 34% of the cases did not over-express any proteins (-); 24.5% over-expressed (+) only PGP, 11% only LRP, 1.5% only MRP, 24.5% both PGP and LRP, and 4.5% both PGP and MRP. The mean intracellular daunorubicin accumulation (IDA) and rhodamine 123 (Rh123) retention in the presence or absence of the reversal agent SDZ PSC 833 (PSC) of the PGP-/LRP-/MRP- cases were comparable to the ones observed in normal leucocytes. With respect to the non-over-expressing cases, the PGP-/LRP+/MRP- cases showed only an impaired IDA (mean 204 +/- 29; P < 0.001). The PGP+/ LRP+/MRP- cases had a defect both in IDA (mean 166 +/- 47, P < 0.001) and Rh123 retention (mean 0.42 +/- 0.14: P < 0.001), which were both corrected by PSC. All the PGP+/LRP+/MRP- cases had a defect in IDA (mean daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation 192 +/- 44; P < 0.001). However, only in 8/16 of them an evident defect in Rh123 retention was found. In conclusion, both PGP and LRP over-expression were common in leukaemia. An impaired IDA was found in all cases over-expressing PGP, LRP or both. The study of Rh123 retention could give incorrect information about the blast cells' ability to accumulate cytotoxic drugs in patients over-expressing both PGP and LRP.\n",
      "Blast cells from 26 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were examined, by single and \"two-colour\" flow cytometry, for relationships between membrane CD11b (monoclonal antibody OKM1), CD11c (KB90) and CD14 (Leu-M3). Increased expression of all three determinants was associated with myelomonocytic leukaemias, with their relative diagnostic value in discriminating monocytic (M4 and M5) from non-monocytic (M1, M2 and M3) subtypes being CD14 greater than CD11c greater than CD11b. However, the results also indicated, because of the heterogenous expression of CD11c in particular, and to a lesser extent CD11b, that the patterns or histograms of fluorescent staining were potentially more informative than an empirical subdivision of blasts into positive and negative subpopulations. In addition, analysis of phenotypic correlations by simultaneous two-colour fluorescence showed that the expression of CD11b and CD11c determinants by leukaemic myeloid blasts was highly correlated, in contrast to the expression of CD14 and CD11c which were relatively independent. Consequently, CD11c+ myeloid blasts almost always coexpressed CD11b whereas CD14+ cases of AML often comprised CD14+ CD11c+ and CD14+ CD11c- subpopulations. It is concluded from these observations that CD11c immunophenotyping is a useful supplementary investigation, particularly in CD14- cases of myelomonocytic leukaemia. However, it is also apparent that the presence of membrane CD11c per se is not lineage-specific and that the level of expression is perhaps a more discriminatory factor.\n",
      "Despite significant advances in the treatment of myeloid malignancies, many patients become resistant to therapy and ultimately succumb to their disease. Accumulating evidence over the past several years has suggested that the inadequacy of many leukaemia therapies results from their failure to target the leukaemic stem cell (LSC). For this reason, the LSC population currently represents the most critical target in the treatment of myeloid malignancies. However, while LSCs are ideal targets in the treatment of these diseases, they are also the most difficult population to target. This is due to both their heterogeneity within the LSC population, and also their phenotypic similarities with normal haematopoietic stem cells. This review will highlight the current landscape surrounding LSC biology in myeloid malignancies, with a focus on altered energy metabolism, and how that knowledge is being translated into clinical advances for the treatment of chronic and acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.\n",
      "The expression of thymidine kinase--an enzyme of the DNA precursor pathway--is strictly regulated during the normal cellular cycle, but is much higher and permanently expressed in malignant growing cells. We used this fact to detect neoplastic cells in samples freshly taken from leukaemia patients and kept frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis. Using a new cytofluorometric assay for thymidine kinase in single cells, we were able to identify leukaemic cells in a surplus of normal ones. Our results demonstrate the benefits of this assay for leukaemia diagnosis.\n",
      "For many diseases with a foetal origin, the cause for the disease initiation remains unknown. Common childhood acute leukaemia is thought to be caused by two hits, the first in utero and the second in childhood in response to infection. The mechanism for the initial DNA damaging event are unknown. Here we have used in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models to show that a placental barrier will respond to agents that are suspected of initiating childhood leukaemia by releasing factors that cause DNA damage in cord blood and bone marrow cells, including stem cells. We show that DNA damage caused by in utero exposure can reappear postnatally after an immune challenge. Furthermore, both foetal and postnatal DNA damage are prevented by prenatal exposure of the placenta to a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant. We conclude that the placenta might contribute to the first hit towards leukaemia initiation by bystander-like signalling to foetal haematopoietic cells.\n",
      "There is mounting evidence that childhood leukaemia is associated with high birth weight, but few studies have examined the relationship between leukaemia and other perinatal factors that influence birth weight, such as maternal weight or gestational weight gain. This case-cohort study included 916 acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and 154 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases diagnosed prior to age 10 years between 1985 and 2001 and born in New York State excluding New York City between 1978 and 2001. Controls (n=9686) were selected from the birth cohorts for the same years. Moderate increased risk of both ALL and AML was associated with birth weight 3500 g or more. For ALL, however, there was evidence of effect modification with birth weight and maternal prepregnancy weight. High birth weight was associated with ALL only when the mother was not overweight while heavier maternal weight was associated with ALL only when the infant was not high birth weight. Increased pregnancy-related weight gain was associated with ALL. For AML, birth weight under 3000 g and higher prepregnancy weight were both associated with increased risk. These findings suggest childhood leukaemia may be related to factors influencing abnormal fetal growth patterns.\n",
      "Understanding the extent to which childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas are heritable is important to the survivors of these diseases, their families and clinicians who provide genetic counselling. Such understanding is also relevant to the possibility raised by Gardner et al. (1990, Br. Med. J., 300, 423-429) that paternal preconception irradiation may be an aetiological factor in these diseases. No malignant neoplasm was diagnosed among 382 offspring of survivors of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma followed up for a median period of 5.8 years, the largest available cohort of such offspring. These data indicate that it is unlikely that the risk of a malignant neoplasm occurring in the offspring exceeds eight times that expected in the general population. Similarly, the risk of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma among offspring is unlikely to exceed 21 times that expected. The proportion of survivors of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma with the heritable form of these diseases is unlikely to exceed 5%, assuming an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission, with penetrance of at least 70% and that all heritable cases develop by age 15 years. The best (i.e. at present most likely) estimates of these risks are of course much lower. There was no evidence of an excess of congenital abnormalities among the offspring and the sex ratio was similar to that expected from the general population.\n",
      "Forty patients with different varieties of leukaemia and lymphoma were studied before and after therapy. Red cells and lymphocytes from each patient were tested for foetal antigen by lectin-agglutination test. The antigen was detectable on red cells in all untreated cases, the highest titre being found in chronic myeloid leukaemia. The titre showed significant reduction after treatment in all cases. We conclude that foetal antigen on red cells is a useful diagnostic aid in haematological malignancy and is a good indicator of the outcome of therapy.\n",
      "Subcutaneous lesions were seen in three of 13 neutropenia patients who had Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia bacteraemia. The characteristic clinical presentation resembled leukaemic infiltrates, and were different from deep ulcers or subcutaneous nodules caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The three patients had acute leukaemia and were treated with intensive combination chemotherapy. All had previously been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and each patient recovered after proper combination antibiotic treatment given according to sensitivity testing.\n",
      "Donor-derived myelodysplastic syndrome/acute leukaemia (DD-MDS/AL) is a rare life-threatening complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. However, it is unknown whether the risk differs by HSC source. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of DD-MDS/AL in 2390 engrafted patients. With a median follow-up of 7·1 years (1-20·8), the incidence of DD-MDS/AL was 0·53% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0·01-1·41%], 0·56% (95%CI, 0·01-1·36%) and 0·56% (95%CI, 0·01-1·10%) in recipients of bone marrow (n = 1117), peripheral blood (n = 489) and umbilical cord blood (UCB, n = 784), respectively. While follow-up is shorter in recipients of UCB and peripheral blood, incidence of DD-MDS/AL is, thus far, similar between HSC sources.\n",
      "Evaluation of cell morphology is usually sufficient to diagnose acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). In this chapter we discuss the features of classical hypergranular APL, the APL variant, hyperbasophilic promyelocytic leukaemia, APL with basophil-like granules, acute eosinophilic leukaemia with PML/RARalpha positivity and the morphology of APL cells lacking t(15;17). In addition to morphological examination, cytochemical investigations (peroxidase chloroacetate-esterase, etc.) may help further in defining the cytology of leukaemic cells in APL.\n",
      "The clustered excess of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma at Seascale, close to the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in the UK is well authenticated and has remained a 'current topic' for over a decade. Its root cause has not been established. Following a study suggesting that parental irradiation exposure prior to conception was a factor, a recent laboratory-based report reopened the debate by indicating the potential for preconception, paternal irradiation (PPI) to result in increased or accelerated induction of lympho-myeloid malignancy in offspring subjected to a recognized leukaemogen. This short commentary presents those new findings in the light of the many and diverse epidemiological investigations of first generation malignancies following parental exposure, the majority of which indicate no real evidence to support the concept that patterns of lympho-myeloid malignancy reflect levels of PPI. Other experimental work supporting PPI are considered against unsuccessful attempts to reproduce them. The alternative, and more popular, hypothesis of infection spread via population mixing, which is more ubiquitous than confinement to nuclear localities, is introduced. Mechanisms of potentiation by PPI are considered, though the danger of applying these current findings to explain the enigma of Seascale, or any other cluster, is recognized.\n",
      "Patients with trisomy 21 have an increased incidence of haematological disorders, including neonatal 'leukaemoid reaction' (transient myeloproliferative disorder [TMD]), and acute leukaemias. In the past it has been felt that patients with trisomy 21 and acute leukaemia do not tolerate, and hence may not warrant, therapy as intensive as those without the syndrome. The present authors' experience and the current literature do not support this view. Two cases are reported of acute myeloid leukaemia in children with trisomy 21, successfully treated with intensive chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of three phases of chronic myeloid leukaemia at first presentation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Oncology, Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Rawalpindi, from June 2006 to December 2007. METHODOLOGY: Forty-five patients of either gender with Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) at their first presentation in outpatient department were included in the study by consecutive sampling technique. All patients were diagnosed on blood complete picture and bone marrow examination including aspiration, trephine and cytogenetics at Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). Each phase was defined on the basis of World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. RESULTS: Out of 45, there were 31 (68.9%) male and 14 (31.1%) female patients. The mean age of presentation was 37.9 years. The pattern of presentation revealed 35 (77.8%) in Chronic Phase (CP), 7 (15.5%) in Accelerated Phase (AP) and 3 (6.7%) in Blast Crisis (BC). Philadelphia chromosome was detected in 39 (86.7%) cases on culture method. Splenomegaly was observed in 37 (82.2%) patients. The mean total leukocyte count, platelet count, haemoglobin and marrow blast were 214.3 x 10(9)/L, 551.4 x 10(9)/L, 9.94 g/dl and 9.3% respectively. CONCLUSION: CML presented at a younger age in the chronic phase.\n",
      "Classification of lymphoid malignancy has changed markedly in recent years and advances have been made in therapy. This study investigated the variations in treatment and survival of 1622 patients in a population-based registry. A total of 1009 cases of malignant lymphoma (ML) were classified according to the Kiel classification. Pathology review resulted in major diagnostic changes for 24% of cases. Of the ML cases, 39% had not had full staging procedures. Younger patients were more likely to have been treated with multiagent chemotherapy regimens, as were patients with B symptoms. Median survival for ML patients was 12 months for high-grade patients and more than 60 months for low-grade patients. Significant factors affecting the survival of ML patients were performance status, whether treatment had followed a recognised protocol, whether treatment had been carried out at a specialist oncology centre (SOC), grade of disease, stage, gender and age. The same factors had a significant effect on survival of the leukaemia patients, except for treatment at an SOC, which had a significant favourable effect on survival of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients only. Median survival for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 43 months and 7 months for ALL patients.\n",
      "Eight of nine leukaemic cats had chromosomal abnormalities. The major differences between the healthy, FeLV-negative control cats and the leukaemic cats were the increased number of hyperdiploid cells and the presence of double minute or morphologically abnormal chromosomes in the leukaemic cats. Three leukaemic cats had cells with double minute chromosomes, while no normal cats had cells with double minute chromosomes. Tetrasomy or trisomy most frequently involved chromosomes C2 and B4. Monosomy was most common in chromosomes A3, C2, D4, E3 and F2. Chromosome abnormalities were also observed in bone marrow cells from two of three healthy, FeLV-positive cats and both cats with thymic lymphosarcoma. Increased numbers of hyperdiploid cells, double minute chromosomes and trisomy of C2 were the most important findings. No correlations between cytogenetic findings and diagnosis or prognosis were found. Additional research is necessary to determine the significance of chromosome aberrations in cells from healthy, FeLV-positive cats. If these changes prove to represent early neoplastic transformation, chromosome analysis could provide valuable diagnostic information and identify patients that might benefit from early chemotherapy. Results of this limited study indicate (1) chromosome aberrations are common in leukaemic cats, (2) chromosome changes are not completely random, (3) direct bone marrow technique for chromosome analysis is generally preferable in leukaemic cats and (4) the cat appears to be a good model in which to study chromosomal abnormalities in leukaemia, though more research is needed.\n",
      "Incidence of childhood leukaemia was studied among subjects of a trial comparing administration of several doses of a conjugate vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) starting at an early age (three months) with a single dose given at the age of two years. Among 114 000 subjects, a total of 77 cases of childhood leukaemia were detected. The incidence of childhood leukaemia was lower in the early vaccination arm (relative risk 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.46-1.13) than late vaccination arm, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Our results suggest that early immunization against Hib may reduce the incidence of childhood leukaemia, but confirmatory studies are needed.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative rescue therapy for patients (pts) with chemotherapy-refractory acute leukaemia. Disease control prior to HSCT is essential for long-term disease-free survival after HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively analysed the outcome of 20 pts aged 21-64 years with refractory leukaemia (acute myeloid leukaemia, n = 16; acute lymphatic leukaemia, n = 4) who received debulking therapy with clofarabine (10 mg/m², days 1-4) and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m², days 1-4; ClofCy) prior to HSCT. RESULTS: Clofarabine/cyclophosphamide (1-4 cycles) was well tolerated and resulted in a substantial reduction of leukaemic cells in all pts. HSCT was performed in 15 of 20 pts. After HSCT (myeloablative, n = 9; dose-reduced, n = 6), all pts showed engraftment and full donor chimerism (related donors, n = 4 or unrelated donors, n = 11) and all pts achieved complete haematologic remission (CR). The median survival after HSCT is 531 days (range: 48-1462 days), and six pts are still alive after a median of 1245 days. Seven pts died after they had relapsed between days +152 and +1496. One patient died from acute graft-versus-host disease (day +48) and one from systemic fungal infection (day +87). CONCLUSION: Clofarabine/cyclophosphamide is a novel effective treatment approach for pts with chemotherapy-refractory acute leukaemia prior to HSCT. Whether this novel debulking protocol leads to improved long-term outcome in pts with refractory leukaemias remains to be determined in forthcoming clinical studies.\n",
      "The relationship between the standardised registration ratio (SRR) for monocytic leukaemia and the radon concentration by county in England was investigated. Leukaemia data were obtained from the OPCS and cover the age range 0-74 years and the period 1975-86. Radon concentrations were obtained from a recent National Radiological Protection Board report. A significant correlation was observed between the SRR for monocytic leukaemia and the radon concentration by county.\n",
      "Interleukin-18 (IL-18) bioactivity in sera and IL-18 mRNA expression in leukaemia cells of three patients with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL), acute mixed lineage leukaemia (AMLL) and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) accompanied with high serum IL-18 levels have been analysed. There was little serum IL-18 bioactivity in the three patients with ATL, AMLL and ALL, while IL-18 mRNA expression was detected in leukaemia cells of all three patients.\n",
      "TET2 protein is encoded by the gene TET2 which specifically catalyses the demethylation of 5-methylcytosine to cytosine. Mutations in TET2 have been identified in a number of haematological malignancies, including leukaemias and lymphomas. In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), loss of TET2 function drives DNA methylation and gene silencing, contributing to disease pathogenesis and progression, making it an interesting target. Although such mutations are considered rare, there is an increasing body in the literature identifying them as unfavourable prognostic markers in AML. The hypomethylating agent nucleoside analogue 5-azacytidine is used in the treatment of AML and other haematological malignancies i.e. myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It functions by re-activating silenced genes is responsible for cytosine methylation, thereby driving differentiation and also promoting apoptosis of dysfunctional haematological cells. The present review article deals with the consequences of DNA methylation in relation to TET2 in AML, focusing on the potential prognostic effect of TET2 gene mutations, along with demethylating epigenetic strategies towards prediction of therapeutic response. The necessity for personalized therapeutic regimes, especially for older patients suffering from AML with mutated TET2 and/or other genetic alterations, along with its prognostication are also underlined.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate probable association of dietary risk factors with childhood leukaemia. METHODS: The case-control study was conducted at the Children Hospital, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan, from January to December 2017, and comprised children of either gender aged 2-12 years with recently diagnosed acute lymphocytic or acute myelocytic leukaemia An age and gender matched equal group of healthy children was taken as controls. Dietary-intake data was collected for six food groups, namely raw vegetables, fresh fruits, packed fruit juices, caffeinated drinks, junk foods, and processed/precooked food items. Frequency of the selected food group consumption was summarised in six categories: rarely/never, 1-3 days/week, 4-6 days/week, once daily, twice daily and thrice daily. Data was collected through interviews with the mothers using a pre-designed questionnaire, and was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 90 subjects, 45(50%) were in each of the two groups. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups (p>0.05). Consumption of caffeinated drinks and junk food was significantly higher in cases (p=0.001) while controls showed significantly higher consumption of fresh fruits (p=0.0012). No significant difference was noted for consumption of vegetables, packed fruit juices and processed food between the groups (p> 0. 05 ). CONCLUSIONS: Higher consumption of caffeinated drinks and junk food was observed in cases compared to controls.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The association between enterovirus infections in children and risk of leukaemia is unclear. We aimed to assess the risk of leukaemia after enterovirus infection in children. METHODS: We did a nationwide retrospective cohort study by analysing data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Children with enterovirus infections aged younger than 18 years were identified. With use of computer-generated random numbers, children not infected with enterovirus were randomly selected and frequency matched (1:1) with children infected with enterovirus by sex, age, urbanisation level, parental occupation, and index year of enterovirus infection. We only included children with complete baseline data for age and sex and who had at least three clinic visits with the diagnosis of enterovirus infection. The diagnosis date of the first clinic visit for the enterovirus infection was defined as the index date for initiation of follow-up person-year measurement and participants. All study patients were followed up until they developed leukaemia, were lost to follow-up, withdrew from the NHI programme, or until the end of the study without leukaemia (censored). Our primary endpoint was a diagnosis of leukaemia during follow-up. FINDINGS: Insurance claims data for 3 054 336 children younger than 18 years were randomly selected from all insured children in the NHIRD. We identified 282 360 children infected with enterovirus and 282 355 children not infected with enterovirus between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2007. The incidence density rates of leukaemia were 3·26 per 100 000 person-years for the enterovirus-infected and 5·84 per 100 000 person-years for the non-enterovirus-infected cohorts. The risk of leukaemia was significantly lower in the enterovirus-infected cohort than in the non-enterovirus-infected cohort (adjusted subhazard ratio [SHR] 0·44, 95% CI 0·31-0·60; p<0·0001). Children infected with enterovirus have a reduced risk of both lymphocytic leukaemia (adjusted SHR 0·44, 0·30-0·65; p<0·0001) and acute myeloid leukaemia (adjusted SHR 0·40, 0·17-0·97; p=0·04). Herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease were the main diseases associated with the reduced risk of leukaemia. INTERPRETATION: The association between enterovirus infection and the reduced risk of developing leukaemia supports Greaves' delayed infection hypothesis for the cause of childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "Priority lists have been formulated in several countries and cut-backs can be a threat to leukaemia treatment. We analysed the costs in different phases of disease for 54 conventionally treated patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Thirty-two patients reached CR 1, seven patients are still alive as of May 1994. We found a cost per week and patient of 17,334 Swedish Crowns (SEK) (U.K. 1 pound = 10.57 and U.S. $1 = 5.91, 1990) in induction phase, 1854 in remission phase and 10,529 SEK in relapse phase. In the terminal phase 10% of the total cost was spent. The quality of life of the patients in relapse is discussed and palliative treatment is emphasized.\n",
      "In spite of advances in immunohistochemical techniques, the histological subclassification of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in bone marrow biopsy has remained difficult. In particular, the translation of the diagnostic criteria of the French-American-British (FAB) cooperative group as primarily defined by bone marrow cytology into histology poses considerable problems. In this study, we investigated the expression of lactoferrin (LF) in various subtypes of AML and studied the usefulness of its immunohistochemical detection combined with a panel of antibodies directed against myeloperoxidase (MPOX), lysozyme (LYS), CD34 and naphthol-AS-D-chloroacetate esterase (NACE) staining in solving this problem. Trephine biopsies of 52 cases of AML were selected for histological evaluation in comparison to bone marrow aspirates classified according to FAB (M1 n = 10, M2 n = 7, M3 n = 11, M4 n = 13 and M5 n = 11). The results obtained confirmed the specificity of LF as a marker for secondary granules in neutrophilic myeloid cells and as a tool to subclassify AML. Its parallel application with (immuno-)staining for MPOX, LYS and NACE has allowed the identification of M1, M3, M5 cases, where there LF is lacking. Typically M2 is characterized by a subpopulation of LF-positive cells which tend to display a myelocytic differentiation. However, M4 shows a heterogeneous expression pattern of LF: M4a may be defined as more immature variant without LF expression while in M4b a more mature myeloid subpopulation stains positive for LF.\n",
      "An adult, mixed-breed, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV-) positive female cat was presented with mucosal jaundice and a history of anorexia and constipation for three days. Physical examination revealed splenomegaly, cachexia, and dehydration. Humane euthanasia was conducted, followed by postmortem examination. Grossly, the cat was icteric, and presented hepatomegaly with multifocal white spots and splenomegaly. Histologically, the bone marrow was nearly completely replaced by a proliferation of megakaryocytes and megakaryoblasts, and there was a proliferation of fibrous connective tissue. Similar neoplastic proliferation was observed infiltrating the liver, lymph nodes, spleen, kidney, skeletal muscle, and lungs. Immunohistochemistry was performed for von Willebrand Factor (VWF), CD79α, CD3, feline immunodeficiency virus, FeLV, and CD61. Marked cytoplasmic labelling was observed in the neoplastic cells for FeLV, VWF and CD61, corroborating the diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia.\n",
      "A previous study indicated that a highly inbred CBA/H mouse colony contained four genotypic variants for telomere-like repeat (TLR) sequence arrays and that one variant subpopulation that constituted 20% of the colony contributed the vast majority (> 90%) of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs). Through screening of a satellite CBA/H colony and rescreening of the original colony, we show that, whereas germline telomere sequence polymorphism is frequent in CBA/H mice, there is no genetic link between a specific TLR locus variant and susceptibility to AML. Studies on telomere-hybridising fragments between 200 bp and 150 kb revealed that the germline telomere mutation frequency was highest for restriction fragments > 50 kb. The hypervariability of these high-molecular-weight fragments resulted in each CBA/H mouse from the highly inbred colony having a different genotype. Although it was not possible to ascribe a specific somatic telomere mutation to AML development, telomere rearrangements were common in induced AMLs. Some terminal telomere-hybridising restriction fragments were shortened in AML samples in comparison with normal tissue, but, insofar as the reduction in size was relatively small, it seems unlikely that telomere erosion is a major contributor to the molecular pathology of murine radiation-induced AML.\n",
      "The diagnosis and follow-up process of adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is challenging to clinicians and laboratory staff alike. While several sets of recommendations have been published over the years, the development of high throughput screening and characterization for both genetic and epigenetic events have evolved with astonishing speed. Here we attempt to provide a practical guide to diagnose and follow adult AML patients with a focus on how to balance the wealth of information on the one hand, with the restriction put on these processes in terms of time, feasibility and economy when caring for these patients, on the other.\n",
      "Morphological criteria usually applied to diagnose various subtypes of B-cell chronic lymphoid leukaemia are largely subjective. Immunophenotyping of 61 relevant cases using a selected panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb), showed that CD1c and CD23 mAb were able to separate B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) from other chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases. Lymphocytes of B-CLL were CD1c-, CD23+, whereas those of other types of chronic B-cell leukaemia were CD1c+/-, CD23-, and CD38/-. Non-B-CLL cases had a significantly higher amount of large peroxidase-negative (unstained) cells analyzed with an automated blood cell counter (Technicon H6000). This type of volumetric assessment allowed a separation between typical and \"atypical\" B-CLL, which otherwise were both CD1c-, and CD23+. These combinations of phenotypic markers corresponded to well-defined haematopathologic entities, conventionally diagnosed on peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow smears, and on histologic sections of lymph nodes and spleen.\n",
      "Reports of a suspected cluster of childhood leukaemia cases in West Central Phoenix have led to a number of epidemiological studies in the geographical area. We report here on a death certificate-based mortality study, which indicated an elevated rate ratio of 1.95 during 1966-1986, using the remainder of the Phoenix standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) as a comparison region. In the process of analysing the data from this study, a methodology for dealing with denominator variability in a standardized mortality ratio was developed using a simple linear Poisson model. This new approach is seen as being of general use in the analysis of standardized rate ratios (SRR), as well as being particularly appropriate for cluster investigations.\n",
      "Patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia often become refractory to platelet transfusions. Increased clearance of transfused platelets due to alloimmune destruction has been identified as one of the primary mechanisms contributing to this refractory state. We performed a double-blind randomized trial to determine whether the administration of anti-D to Rh-positive individuals could prevent the refractory state and improve post-transfusion platelet response. Rh-positive patients with acute leukaemia undergoing induction chemotherapy and requiring platelet transfusions were allocated to weekly intravenous anti-D (20 micrograms/kg) or placebo. Platelets and red cell concentrates were administered according to standardized transfusion guidelines. Outcome measures included platelet transfusion utilization, red cell utilization, platelet recovery 18-24 h post-infusion, and the percentage of patients refractory to platelet transfusion. There were 43 patients studied: 21 received anti-D and 22 saline placebo. The mean number of platelet concentrates required per day of observation was 0.59 (SD 0.22) in the anti-D group and 0.61 (SD 0.22) in the placebo group, P = 0.86. No difference was detected between groups in terms of platelet recovery post-infusion, refractoriness to platelet transfusion or frequency of infection (P = 0.97). Red cell concentrate utilization was significantly increased in the anti-D group compared to the placebo group, 0.58 units per day versus 0.37 units per day respectively, P = 0.005. We conclude that the use of anti-D did not improve post-transfusion platelet response in Rh positive patients with acute leukaemia, but did result in an increased need for red cell transfusion.\n",
      "Involvement of the central nervous system has important therapeutic implications in acute leukaemia. Because the identification of blast cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is often difficult, there is a need for sensitive markers of leukaemic infiltration. Since the shed form of L-selectin (sL-selectin) is frequently increased in acute leukaemia (sL-selectin+ leukaemia), we examined whether assay of sL-selectin in CSF could improve our ability to detect such meningeal involvement. CSF sL-selectin was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in 15 patients with sL-selectin+ meningeal leukaemia (median 60 ng/mL, range 34-150) than in 20 patients with acute leukaemia without meningeal involvement (12 ng/mL, 1-39) or 88 control patients (14 ng/mL, 0-37). Serial measurements of sL-selectin in patients with sL-selectin+ leukaemic meningitis showed increased CSF concentrations of the cleaved receptor in 4 patients with therapy-resistant meningeal leukaemia and sustained normal concentrations in 9 patients in remission. Our results suggest that CSF sL-selectin may be a useful marker in the detection of meningeal involvement by blast cells in patients with sL-selectin+ leukaemia.\n",
      "The international incidence of myeloid leukaemia, cancer of the kidney, melanoma, and certain childhood cancers all show significant correlation with radon exposure in the home. For myeloid leukaemia, analysis suggests that in the UK 6-12% of incidence may be attributed to radon. In Cornwall, where radon levels are higher, the range is 23-43%. For the world average radon exposure of 50 Bq.m-3, 13-25% of myeloid leukaemia at all ages may be caused by radon.\n",
      "A computer program has been developed for computer-assisted diagnosis (including subclassification) of flow cytometry data of acute leukaemias and non-Hodgkin lymphomas by means of artificial intelligence. The knowledge base for the system has been formulated as semantic networks that describe physiological hematopoiesis as well as the pathological situation (e.g., aberrant antigen expression) of hematological disorders. The semantic networks reflect the hierarchy of cells and their occurrence in diseases, the normal and pathological antigen expression patterns of cells, cell maturation, and the frequency of cell populations in normal blood and bone marrow. Using these semantic networks, the diagnosis algorithm compares the characteristic antigen expression pattern of a disease with the actual findings in the blood or bone marrow sample. The algorithm can separate mixed populations by taking double staining findings into account. Finally, a diagnosis text is generated that describes all identified cell populations and the resulting diagnosis. The validation of the program showed a correct diagnosis (disease group and subclassification) in 97% of the cases (n = 633) with slight differences between the disease groups (e.g., B-NHL: 99%, B-cell ALL: 84%).\n",
      "Factors and inhibitors of coagulation and fibrinolysis were investigated on admission in 57 patients with acute leukaemia and they were correlated to the occurrence of haemorrhage. Coagulation disturbances were found in 98%. Seventeen of the patients with haemorrhagic symptoms had major bleeding. Severe thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 10(9)/l) was found in 16%. Patients with major bleedings had significantly lower concentrations of prothrombin complex, fibrinogen, protein C and platelets. Low levels of antiplasmin and fibrinogen were characteristic of 'bleeders' with promyelocytic and lymphoblastic leukaemia. We found a positive correlation between vWF:Ag and leukaemic cell count especially in lymphoblastic leukaemia (ks = 0.72). Reduced levels of antithrombin indicated a poorer prognosis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Children with Down syndrome (DS) who developed leukaemia have had a worse prognosis than other children with leukaemia in the past. In the 1970s and early 1980s, some children with DS who developed leukaemia received fewer cycles of chemotherapy or were advised not to have treatment. METHODS: In this population-based study, trends in 5-year survival from leukaemia were evaluated for children with and without DS who were diagnosed in Great Britain during 1971-2000 and followed to the end of 2004. RESULTS: For all children, with and without DS, survival has increased dramatically over the 30 year study period. For lymphoid leukaemia, survival in children with DS increased, but remains lower than for other children (5-year survival 59% vs 83% during 1996-2000). For acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL), however, 5-year survival improved substantially for children with DS, from less than 1% in the early 1970s to over 80% in the 1990s. For other children, survival increased from 6% to 64% during the same period. CONCLUSION: Survival for all children diagnosed with leukaemia has improved during the last three decades. For lymphoid leukaemia, the inferior outcome observed on more recent treatment protocols in children with DS remains an area for concern. For ANLL, the improvement in survival for children with DS is due to a number of factors, namely increased recruitment of these children to clinical trials, changes in clinical practice and important differences in the biology of myeloid leukaemia in young children with DS, resulting in a better response to some chemotherapeutic agents.\n",
      "Diagnosis and classification of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) require cytogenetic and molecular genetic investigation. However, while these evaluations are pending, morphology supplemented by immunophenotyping can provide clues to the diagnosis of specific cytogenetic/genetic categories of AML. Most importantly, acute promyelocytic leukaemia can be diagnosed with a high degree of certainty. However, provisional identification of cases associated with t(8; 21), inv(16), t(1; 22), and NPM1 mutation may also be possible. In addition, transient abnormal myelopoiesis of Down syndrome can generally be diagnosed morphologically.\n",
      "Occupational exposure to petrochemicals, in particular benzene, has been identified as a risk factor in the development of acute leukaemia. A cohort of exposed (n = 44) and non-exposed individuals (n = 19) from the same petrochemical installation were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by oligonucleotide hybridization (ONH) for the presence of mutations in the H, K, and NRAS cellular proto-oncogenes. A KRAS mutation was detected in one individual from the exposed group who was haematologically normal at the time of sampling. The presence of this mutation was confirmed by nude mouse tumorigenicity assay and positively identified as a K13 Gly-Asp substitution by cloning and sequencing.\n",
      "In the last ten years there has been increasing concern that the extremely low frequency (ELF), non-ionising electromagnetic fields emitted by electrical installations and equipment using alternating current at 50-60 Hertz might have long-term effects on health. Studies of the association between disease and residence near installations transmitting or generating electricity and studies of the health of workers in the electrical industry are reviewed. Most of the investigations relate to cancer, although other conditions such as outcome of pregnancy have been studied. The most consistent finding is that electrical workers appear to be at increased risk of leukaemia, especially acute myeloid leukaemia. The effect is small. Combining the results of eleven separate investigations suggests an 18% increase in the risk of leukaemia (RR = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.29) which is partly or wholly due to a 46% increase in the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (RR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.27-1.65). It is not clear whether this increase is specific to certain types of work within the electrical industry. Nor is it possible to determine from the available data if the increase in leukaemia is due to electromagnetic fields or to other factors to which electrical workers are exposed. There is no clear association between cancer risk and residence near sources transmitting electricity, although some data suggest that there may be small increases in leukaemia in those living very close to the sources. The relationship between adverse outcome of pregnancy and exposure to sources of ELF electromagnetic fields needs further investigation. Studies of the possible effects of ELF electromagnetic fields on health are hampered by problems in measuring exposure and by the ubiquity of exposure in the community.\n",
      "Fungal colonization has been associated with an increased rate of invasive fungal infections in neutropenic patients. This study evaluates weekly fungal surveillance cultures from the oropharyngeal and perianal space as well as other suspected sites in 219 courses of myelosuppressive chemotherapy with itraconazole antifungal prophylaxis in 116 neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia. Itraconazole was given from the start of chemotherapy in one of six different dosing regimens. Fungal colonization occurred in 68 (31%) of courses, which was lower than in a historical control group without prophylaxis (53%, P = 0.004). Twenty-six per cent of these 116 isolates had a growth rate of more than 50 colony forming units (CFU) per culture. Candida glabrata (51%), Candida albicans (18%) and Candida krusei (4%) were the most frequently isolated species. Higher median itraconazole trough concentrations were associated with a lower growth rate in the cultures (< or = 50 CFU/culture versus > 50 CFU/culture): 710 (430-1180) ng ml-1 versus 900 (560-1650) ng ml-1 (P = 0.015). The use of itraconazole solution--compared with capsules--led to a reduced growth rate (P = 0.035). In conclusion, compared with historical controls itraconazole antifungal prophylaxis reduces the incidence and the extent of fungal colonization during neutropenia in patients with acute leukaemia.\n",
      "A conventional and a computer search of the literature yielded 627 sequenced point mutations in the ras and p53 genes in 575 patients with leukaemia and myelodysplasia (MDS) out of a total of 4214 investigated. ras Mutations predominated in myeloid leukaemia and were more common in the disease in relapse than at presentation. There was no clinical, or haematological difference or difference in survival between ras positive and ras negative patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adults or children, but ras mutations carried a poorer prognosis in childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia and an increased risk of leukaemia in MDS. p53 mutations predominated in lymphoid leukaemia and were several fold more frequent in leukaemia in relapse than in the de novo disease, were associated with loss of the normal p53 allele (monosomy 17) in > 50% of cases and carried a poor prognosis in AML, MDS and chronic lymphatic leukaemia and a 3.8-fold increase risk of death in T cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia. There were 163 transitions for every 100 transversions, the expected number being ca 50. Consideration of the molecular mechanisms by which nitrous acid produces transitions allows transitions resulting from the deamination of cytosine to be distinguished from those resulting from the deamination of adenine. The former constitute 84.67% and the latter 15.33% of the 372 transitions present. Again purine-->pyrimidine and pyrimidine-->purine transversions form 80.35 and 19.65%, respectively, of the 228 transversions present. The possible bearing of this highly non-random distribution on the aetiology of point mutations in leukaemia and myelodysplasia is discussed.\n",
      "Cases of acalculous cholecystitis in patients with acute leukaemia are rare. Manifestations of the primary disease often mask the acute cholecystitis symptoms. A high index of suspicion and ultrasonographic examination in leukaemic patients with abdominal pain and unexplained fever may allow earlier diagnosis, before the development of complications. We report two cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis during the course of acute leukaemia.\n",
      "Acute leukaemias are characterized by nonrandom chromosomal aberrations which are often strictly related to the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs). Alterations at the short arm of chromosome 9 have been reported in a remarkable percentage of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL) and have been suggested to cause the loss of activity of the putative TSG, p16INK4A (MTS1/CDKN2) gene. In order to evaluate the correlation between this gene inactivation and visible cytogenetic abnormalities, we have investigated p16INK4A homozygous gene deletions in 10 paediatric acute leukaemias of different cell lineages which demonstrated karyotype aberrations involving chromosome 9. Moreover, the dimension of the genetic alteration was evaluated by studying the loss of heterozygosity of two highly polymorphic markers of chromosome 9p, namely alpha-interferon (IFNA) and D9S104, and the deletion of 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAPase) gene. Finally, the deletion of a gene belonging to p16INK4A family, the p18 gene, was analysed in these acute leukaemias. Our results demonstrated that: (1) the biallelic loss of p16INK4A gene is strictly related to a specific immunophenotype, namely ALL of T-cell lineage; (ii) no significant correlation exists between alterations at chromosome 9p level and the homozygous deletions of p16INK4A gene; and (iii) p18 gene was not deleted in the examined cases. These findings suggest a possible correlation between the T-lymphocyte phenotype and the expression of p16INK4A gene. Moreover, the absence of MTAPase activity seems to be a valuable marker of p16INK4A gene inactivation, thus indicating that the deleted chromosomal area on 9p21 very frequently involves the MTAPase gene.\n",
      "An inactivated feline leukaemia vaccine was tested to determine if process improvements would permit it to be effectively used in a two-dose primary regimen versus the three-dose regimen required for a previous vaccine. Twenty-five cats were vaccinated with two subcutaneous doses given 3 weeks apart. Vaccinates and controls were artificially immunosuppressed to enhance susceptibility to challenge, and inoculated with virulent feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) 2 weeks after the second dose. Following challenge, seven (28%) vaccinates became persistently viraemic, versus six (60%) controls. Nine (36%) other vaccinates became transiently viraemic and nine were aviraemic. The mean postvaccination ELISA gp70 antibody value was 0.796 for aviraemic vaccinates, 0.575 for transiently viraemic vaccinates, and 0.350 for persistently viraemic vaccinates. Eighteen of 25 vaccinates had a postvaccination antibody response greater than or equal to 32 to feline oncornavirus associated cell membrane antigen. Seven of 25 (28%) vaccinates developed postvaccination virus neutralization (VN) antibody titres, and 16 of 25 (64%) developed postchallenge VN antibody titres. One of 10 controls developed postchallenge VN antibody titres. An in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis assay to evaluate immunosuppressive effects of vaccination revealed no significant difference in the mean stimulation index for vaccinates versus controls. Results indicated that vaccination with two doses was an effective immunoprophylactic regimen in the face of FeLV challenge severe enough to produce persistent viraemia in 60% of non-vaccinated controls.\n",
      "This paper aims to assist the administration departments of medical organisations in making the right decision on selecting a suitable multiclass classification model for acute leukaemia. In this paper, we proposed a framework that will aid these departments in evaluating, benchmarking and ranking available multiclass classification models for the selection of the best one. Medical organisations have continuously faced evaluation and benchmarking challenges in such endeavour, especially when no single model is superior. Moreover, the improper selection of multiclass classification for acute leukaemia model may be costly for medical organisations. For example, when a patient dies, one such organisation will be legally or financially sued for incidents in which the model fails to fulfil its desired outcome. With regard to evaluation and benchmarking, multiclass classification models are challenging processes due to multiple evaluation and conflicting criteria. This study structured a decision matrix (DM) based on the crossover of 2 groups of multi-evaluation criteria and 22 multiclass classification models. The matrix was then evaluated with datasets comprising 72 samples of acute leukaemia, which include 5327 gens. Subsequently, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are used in the benchmarking and ranking of multiclass classification models. The MCDM used techniques that include the integrated BWM and VIKOR. BWM has been applied for the weight calculations of evaluation criteria, whereas VIKOR has been used to benchmark and rank classification models. VIKOR has also been employed in two decision-making contexts: individual and group decision making and internal and external group aggregation. Results showed the following: (1) the integration of BWM and VIKOR is effective at solving the benchmarking/selection problems of multiclass classification models. (2) The ranks of classification models obtained from internal and external VIKOR group decision making were almost the same, and the best multiclass classification model based on the two was 'Bayes. Naive Byes Updateable' and the worst one was 'Trees.LMT'. (3) Among the scores of groups in the objective validation, significant differences were identified, which indicated that the ranking results of internal and external VIKOR group decision making were valid.\n",
      "We report a population-based study of patterns of care and survival for people with acute leukaemia diagnosed at age 15-29 years during 1984-94 in regions of England and Wales covered by specialist leukaemia registries. There were 879 patients: 417 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 462 with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). For ALL, actuarial survival rates were 43% at 5 years after diagnosis and 37% at 10 years. Survival improved significantly between 1984-88 and 1989-94 for those aged 15-19 at diagnosis. Patients entered in national clinical trials and those not entered had similar survival rates. Survival rates were similar at teaching and non-teaching hospitals and at hospitals treating different numbers of study patients per year. For AML, survival rates were 42% at 5 years after diagnosis and 39% at 10 years. Survival improved significantly between 1984-88 and 1989-94. Patients entered in the Medical Research Council AML10 trial had a higher survival rate than those who were in the earlier AML9 trial. Survival did not vary with category of hospital. We conclude that survival has improved for adolescents and young adults with acute leukaemia but that there is at present no evidence that centralized treatment results in a survival benefit for patients in this age group.\n",
      "There is an interactive relationship between leukaemia and oxidative stress. Leukaemic cells produce larger amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than non-leukaemic cells as they are under a continual state of oxidative siege. So, this study was performed on 20 patients with chronic leukaemia from the Oncology Centre, Mansoura University. We measured leucocytic H(2)O(2) concentrations and lipid peroxidation as serum malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, serum total antioxidant activity, plasma ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid concentrations, blood reduced glutathione concentration, haemolysate G6PD activity, blood catalase activity, serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and serum anti-dsDNA concentration. We found that chronic leukaemia patients showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in leucocytic H(2)O(2), serum MDA concentration and total antioxidant activity either before or after treatment as compared with control group. Also, there was a significant increase in the other parameters (glutathione, catalase and SOD) either before or after treatment, but we found a significant decrease in ascorbic acid concentration and G6PD activity. There was a significant increase in anti-dsDNA concentration either before or after treatment. It can be concluded that leukaemic patients produce larger amounts of ROS than non-leukaemic patients. Also, the increase in antioxidant activity in leukaemic patients is not high enough to counteract the harmful effects of free radicals. This scenario becomes worse after administration of chemotherapy.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a rare but severe form of human cancer that results from a limited number of functionally cooperating genetic abnormalities leading to uncontrolled proliferation and impaired differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Before the identification of genetic driver lesions, chemically, irradiation or viral infection-induced mouse leukaemia models provided platforms to test novel chemotherapeutics. Later, transgenic mouse models were established to test the in vivo transforming potential of newly cloned fusion genes and genetic aberrations detected in patients' genomes. Hereby researchers constitutively or conditionally expressed the respective gene in the germline of the mouse or reconstituted the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated mice with bone marrow virally expressing the mutation of interest. More recently, immune deficient mice have been explored to study patient-derived human AML cells in vivo. Unfortunately, although complementary to each other, none of the currently available strategies faithfully model the initiation and progression of the human disease. Nevertheless, fast advances in the fields of next generation sequencing, molecular technology and bioengineering are continuously contributing to the generation of better mouse models. Here we review the most important AML mouse models of each category, briefly describe their advantages and limitations and show how they have contributed to our understanding of the biology and to the development of novel therapies.\n",
      "We examined whether the allegedly aberrant expression of the lymphoid lineage associated DNA polymerase, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is associated with alterations of the enzyme at the cellular, biochemical or transcriptional level when compared to lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), either lacking or expressing myeloid antigens. By flowcytometric analysis, the intensity of TdT staining with monoclonal anti-TdT antibody was considerably weaker in TdT+ AML and myeloid+ ALL (M+ ALL) than in myeloid- ALL (M- ALL). TdT enzyme activity in TdT+ AML was on an average 10%, and in M+ ALL 25% of that measured in M- ALL. Anti-TdT antibodies precipitated a major specific protein of identical relative molecular mass (58 kD) from metabolically labelled TdT+ myeloblasts and lymphoblasts. By Northern blot analysis and ribonuclease protection assay, TdT transcript levels were significantly lower in TdT+ myeloblasts and M+ lymphoblasts than in M- ALL (P < 0.0001). The level of TdT transcription in AML was independent of the simultaneous expression of lymphoid-specific antigens, such as CD2 and CD19. Our data demonstrate that TdT expression is downregulated in association with myeloid features, not only in AML but also in ALL. This observation may provide the molecular basis for the differential therapeutic responsiveness, particularly to glucocorticoids, in these various leukaemia subtypes.\n",
      "An increasing number of cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations have been identified in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), highlighting the biological heterogeneity of the disease. Moreover, the characterisation of specific molecular abnormalities provides the basis for targeted therapies, such as all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide treatment in acute promyelocytic leukaemia or tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML with FLT3 mutations. Several cytogenetic and molecular genetic changes have been shown to be prognostically relevant and have been acknowledged in the latest WHO classification of AML as separate entities. A detailed marker assessment at diagnosis is crucial for risk-stratification of AML patients, allowing the identification of those at high risk of relapse, who may benefit from early allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Finally, molecular markers are important for the detection of minimal residual disease after initial therapy and during long-term follow-up, which enables a more tailored treatment approach for individual AML patients.\n",
      "Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is a rare extramedullary malignant tumor composed of immature myeloid cells. It is strongly associated with a well known or covert acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloproliferative diseases or myelodysplastic syndromes. Intraoral MS scarcely occurs. An unusual case of acute myeloid leukaemia, which was diagnosed by mandibular MS that was developed in the alveolar socket after a dental extraction, is reported. The histological examination (including immunohistochemical analysis) of a subsequent biopsy showed infiltration of the oral mucosa by neoplastic cells. This lesion was therefore classified as acute myeloid leukaemia. The patient was referred to oncologists that confirmed the initial diagnosis. The patient underwent chemotherapy and the mandibular tumor disappeared. Forty days later, a relapse of the disease, which appeared as a great-ulcerated lesion, was developed in the hard palate. Thirty days after the second chemotherapy had finished, a new intraoral tumor was developed in the vestibular maxillary gingiva. Review of the literature shows no report of intraoral relapse and particularly multiple relapse of a MS that involves the oral cavity. Even though MS is encountered infrequently in the oral cavity, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of conditions (especially tumors) with a similar clinical appearance.\n",
      "Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with leukaemia is an aggressive therapeutic procedure which implies high early mortality. Current opinion trends attribute the greater part of the procedure toxicity to the preparative regimen. The results of a multivariate analysis on data of 174 leukaemia patients conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI), 10-12 Gy, single dose or fractionated, and lung shielding at 8 Gy, plus chemotherapy: cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, before or after TBI, are presented. The variables statistically related with early mortality are age, Karnofsky index (KI) and acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). No variable depending on radiotherapy reached the significance level. The relative risk of early mortality for patients older than 26 years, in bad general condition (KI < 90%), or developing acute severe (grades II-IV)GvHD, is 3.99, 5.68, and 6.71, respectively. We conclude that in the range of TBI schedules analysed, radiation therapy is not an important factor in early death, but acute severe GvHD, or recipient bad general condition are factors to be improved by bone marrow transplantation teams if they want to improve the therapeutic index of the procedure.\n",
      "We report the case of a 46-year-old man who presented with the hypogranular variant of an acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). RT-PCR analysis for detection of the t(15;17) fusion transcript confirmed the cytological findings by demonstrating a bcr-3 type PML/RARalpha rearrangement. According to the WHO-classification, this leukaemia fulfilled the criteria for 'Acute promyelocytic leukaemia with t(15;17)(q22;q12)'(1). Immunophenotyping revealed a leukaemic population with an aberrant expression of markers. Besides the presence of the expected immunophenotypic markers in APL (CD45 with low density, CD13+, CD33+, CD15-, CD117+ and MPO+), the population showed a positivity for CD34, CD2 and HLA-DR for at least a part of the malignant promyelocytes. Since the expression of these three markers, all together, is rather unique, we reviewed the literature to prove the relationship of this specific immunophenotype with morphology, clinical and molecular findings.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Increased bone marrow (BM) hematogones (HGs) are often observed in patients with marrow regenerating status. Many studies have focused on the role of HGs in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but very little has been done to understand their effects on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through immunophenotyping, HGs were quantified in 471 BM samples from 292 postchemotherapy AML cases. These samples were analysed to determine whether there is any relationship between HGs percentages and French-American-British (FAB) subtypes or risk stratification of AML. RESULTS: HGs were identified in 57.75% of 471 patient samples (271) with a mean percentage of 3.87 ± 0.25%. No significant differences were found amongst different FAB subtypes of AML (P > 0.05). However, significant differences (P < 0.05) in HG numbers were noted between AML patients experiencing haematological complete remission (HCR) and those who have relapsed. HGs were identified in 59.9% of samples under HCR with a mean per cent of 3.98 ± 0.31%, and 36.7% of individuals who have relapsed have detectable HGs with a mean per cent of 1.75 ± 0.47. In addition, HGs in patients groups with low risk or intermediate risk were elevated when compared with high-risk groups (P < 0.05), whilst no significant difference was found between low-risk patients and intermediate-risk patients (P > 0.05). Patients with >0.1% of HGs had a significantly better median leukaemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) than those with <0.1% of HGs (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our data indicate that HGs in bone marrow may be used as a favourable prognostic factor that predict for a better outcome of AML patients.\n",
      "Despite the plethora of clinical literature on the medical treatment for paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), there is a dearth of psycho-social literature on how families cope with either the disease or its treatments. The present article seeks to make a contribution by placing psychosocial aspects of childhood AML on the agenda. The findings are from a 5-year longitudinal, qualitative study on the psychosocial aspects of paediatric leukaemia. Qualitative data is gathered from open-ended interviews at three points in time on the experience of illness. The holistic findings from T1 present the impact of diagnosis and early treatment for childhood AML from the perspective of mothers, father, sibling and child patients. The study is also following up families with related disorders, thus it is possible to assess difference to other haematological groups. The findings indicate that the families bring scant prior understanding of the illness, and experience the diagnosis with fear and seriousness as a confrontation with death. At the point of entering treatment they are in a profound sense of shock and grief, which is exacerbated by a distressing, all pervading, sense of uncertainty. Families can be overwhelmed by the exhaustion of attending to the escalating practical demands of the situation combined with fatigue, worry and poor nutrition. All families find dealing with the invasive procedures and aggressive drug protocols emotionally challenging. However, in spite of the difficulties, parents have a strong desire to be with their child and find any separation painful. Families come to view the ward as a comfort zone where they have the support of the health and allied health team and the camaraderie of others experiencing a similar situation. However, even this support has to be qualified by the need for personal space, the difficulty of handling complex emotions, and the fear of being overwhelmed by difficulties other families face. The insights argue strongly for sensitive support for all individuals coping with childhood AML.\n",
      "Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) with M3 (or M3v) morphology is the only AML subtype to date for which morphology and immunophenotype agree. In other words, FAB M3 is interchangeable with a unique marker profile. More precisely, we have finally recognized a surrogate marker profile for leukaemia derived from the (15;17) translocation and expressing PML/RARalpha transcripts. To present this as a new development may come as a surprise to many. After all, the antigen expression pattern of AML-M3 was well recognized for many years: absence or weak expression of HLA-DR, CD117, CD15, CD11b and CD34 in the context of a myeloid phenotype (CD33 and CD13 expression) and frequently associated with moderate to high side-scatter appearance upon flow cytometric evaluation, depending upon the degree of granularity of the leukaemic cells. While partially correct, this established APL phenotype is both flawed and limited in its ability to distinguish APL from other AML subtypes, such as natural-killer-cell AML. Given the availability of phenotype-specific therapy for APL, such as all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide, failing to diagnose APL or misdiagnosing a case of AML with an APL-like phenotype will result in serious clinical consequences. Faced with this dilemma, we have recently performed a comprehensive immunophenotypic analysis of APL patients entered on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trials. Our results give diagnostic power to only three antigens, HLA-DR, CD11a and CD18, all of which are characteristically expressed at low levels by APL cells. Despite some significant antigenic differences (e.g. in CD34 expression), this surrogate marker profile for t(15;17) APL applies to both the M3 and the M3v FAB phenotypes and to all three isoforms of the PML/RARalpha transcript.\n",
      "Sea cucumbers have been a dietary delicacy and important ingredient in Asian traditional medicinal over many centuries. In this study, edible sea cucumber Holothuria edulis was evaluated for its in vitro anticancer potential. An aqueous fraction of the edible sea cucumber (ESC-AQ) has been shown to deliver a strong cytotoxic effect against the human HL-60 leukaemia cell line. An induction effect of apoptotic body formation in response to ESC-AQ treatment was confirmed in HL-60 cells stained with Hoechst 33342 and confirmed via flow cytometry analysis. The up regulation of Bax and caspase-3 protein expression was observed while the expression of Bcl-xL protein was down regulated in ESC-AQ treated HL-60 cells. Due to the profound anticancer activity, ESC-AQ appears to be an economically important biomass fraction that can be exploited in numerous industrial applications as a source of functional ingredients.\n",
      "CD79 is a heterodimeric molecule comprising two polypeptide chains, B29 (CD79b) and mb-1 (CD79a). It is physically linked in the surface of B cells to membrane immunoglobulin, forming the B cell antigen receptor complex. Expression of the mb-1 (CD79a) chain has been studied in leukaemias and shown to be present in most B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL). In contrast, little is known about the expression of B29 (CD79b) in this condition. Two monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) were used in this study by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry: HM57, against an intracellular epitope of the mb-1(CD79a) chain, and SN8, reacting with an extracellular epitope of B29 (CD79b). Our aim was to investigate the expression of B29 (CD79b) in the various immunological subtypes of B lineage ALL and compare its cytoplasmic and membrane expression. Seventy-nine cases were studied, including 13 chronic myeloid leukaemia in B lymphoid blast crisis (CML-BC) and 66 ALL, subclassified as early B (two), common (28), pre-B (23), mature (five) and biphenotypic with B lymphoid commitment (eight). Most cases expressed mb-1 (CD79a) in the cytoplasm. B29 (CD79b) was expressed in the cytoplasm in 65% (15/23) of pre-B-ALL and in 14% (4/28) common-ALL but it was detected in the cell membrane in only three cases of mature B-ALL, being negative in all other B lineage subtypes ALL. Three of the biphenotypic leukaemias coexpressed cytoplasmic B29 (CD79b) and mu-chain. This was also seen in two cases of CML-BC, while four cases expressed only cytoplasmic B29 (CD79b) without mu-chain. Our results suggest that during B cell differentiation, B29 (CD79b) is expressed later than mb-1 (CD79a) in the cytoplasm and parallels the cytoplasmic expression of mu-chain. B29 (CD79b) is present in the membrane at a later stage compared to its cytoplasmic expression and found in mature B blasts (B-ALL) that express membrane Ig as it is in normal and leukaemic B lymphocytes.\n",
      "Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a cancer treatment already used early in this century, has distinctive advantages over conventional chemotherapy, namely its often observed preferential accumulation in cancer cells and its low intrinsic toxicity. Aggressive therapeutic modalities using high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy are now commonplace treatments for leukaemia, lymphoma and various non-haematologic malignancies. These intensive approaches have often been used in association with haematopoietic-progenitor-cell support and have induced major responses and remissions in patients with relapsed and refractory diseases, ultimately contributing to improve the disease-free survival of patients with high risk. This has encouraged Theratechnologies, a Montreal-based pharmaceutical company, to develop photodynamic ex vivo purging procedures, including the development of new photosensitizers and irradiation devices for the safe eradication of neoplastic cells from autologous grafts. Our first specific objective, therefore, was to design, synthesize, purify and test photoactive rhodamine derivatives. We have also selected a gas and phosphorus coating characteristic of an efficient scanning fluorescent source for extra-corporeal PDT using rhodamine derivatives. 4,5-Dibromorhodamine 123 (TH9402) was selected because of its photophysical properties, low toxicity and stability. TH9402 photodynamic-cell-therapy process conditions recognized as safe for normal human haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors demonstrated the efficacy of the purging procedure on various leukaemias (including chronic-myelogenous-leukaemia as well as non-Hodgkin-leukaemias and metastatic-breast-cancer cell lines.\n",
      "A marker capable of distinguishing with certainty between hairy cell leukaemia and other B-cell malignant disease would be of great diagnostic value. Through gene expression profiling, annexin A1 (ANXA1) has been identified as a gene that is upregulated in hairy cell leukaemia. We did immunostaining of 500 B-cell tumours with a specific anti-ANXA1 monoclonal antibody and showed that ANXA1 protein expression is specific to hairy cell leukaemia. Immunocytochemical detection of ANXA1 represents a simple, inexpensive, highly sensitive and specific (100%) assay for diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia. This assay will be especially useful in distinguishing hairy cell leukaemia from splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes and variant hairy cell leukaemia, both of which usually respond poorly to treatments that are effective in hairy cell leukaemia.\n",
      "Over the past decade, monoclonal antibodies have dramatically impacted the treatment of haematological malignancies, as evidenced by the effect of rituximab on the response rate and survival of patients with follicular and diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Currently, only two monoclonal antibodies - the anti-CD33 immunotoxin gemtuzumab ozogamicin and the CD52-directed antibody alemtuzumab - are approved for treatment of relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia in older patients and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, respectively. Although not approved for such treatment, alemtuzumab is also active against T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, cutaneous T cell lymphoma and Sézary syndrome, and adult T cell leukaemia and lymphoma. In addition, rituximab has demonstrated activity against B cell chronic lymphocytic and hairy cell leukaemia. Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD4, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD45, CD66 and CD122 are now being studied in the clinic for the treatment of leukaemia. Here, we discuss how these new antibodies have been engineered to reduce immunogenicity and improve antibody targeting and binding. Improved interactions with Fc receptors on immune effector cells can enhance destruction of target cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cell lysis. The antibodies can also be armed with cellular toxins or radionuclides to enhance the destruction of leukaemia cells.\n",
      "Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and the association of hypereosinophilia with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are both rare in children. Some acute myelogenous leukaemias can present with eosinophilia, but the relationship between HES and ALL is not well known and is rarer than the relationship between HES and acute myelogenous leukaemia. Patients are diagnosed with HES when no cause is found to explain the eosinophilia leading to end organ damage. For this reason, it is recommended that patients presenting with hypereosinophilia be carefully assessed to exclude any malignant clonal proliferation. HES may present with severe clinical manifestations such as high leucocyte count, anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, hepatosplenomegaly or cardiac and neurological involvement, all of which are primarily features of myeloproliferative disorders. Some patients with HES can develop chronic eosinophilic leukaemia. Successful treatment of HES with agents used in chronic myeloid leukaemia supports the idea that HES can be a chronic myeloid disorder. There are few cases reporting an association between ALL and hypereosinophilia that precedes or is concomitant with ALL. Here we report the case of a 14-year-old girl who developed common B ALL 7 months after diagnosis and treatment of HES. Interestingly, eosinophilia was not concomitant with the diagnosis of ALL.\n",
      "Childhood leukaemia survivors (CLS) are known to have developed long-term impairment of lung function. The reasons for that complication are only partially known. The aims of this study were to assess pulmonary function in CLS and identify (1) risk factors and (2) clinical manifestations for the impairment of airflow and lung diffusion. The study group included 74 CLS: 46 treated with chemotherapy alone (HSCT-), 28 with chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT+), and 84 healthy subjects (control group (CG)). Spirometry and diffusion limit of carbon monoxide (DLCO) tests were performed in all subjects. Ten (14%) survivors had restrictive, five (7%) had obstructive pattern, and 47 (66%) had reduced DLCO. The age at diagnosis, type of transplant, and type of conditioning regimen did not significantly affect the pulmonary function tests. The DLCO%pv were lower in CLS than in CG (p < 0.03) and in the HSCT+ than in the HSCT- survivors (p < 0.05). The pulmonary infection increased the risk of diffusion impairment (OR 5.1, CI 1.16-22.9, p = 0.019). DLCO was reduced in survivors who experienced CMV lung infection (p < 0.001). The main symptom of impaired lung diffusion was poor tolerance of exercise (p < 0.005). The lower lung diffusion capacity is the most frequent abnormality in CLS. HSCT and pulmonary infection, in particular with CMV infection, are strong risk factors for impairment of lung diffusion capacity in CLS. Clinical manifestation of DLCO impairment is poor exercise tolerance. A screening for respiratory abnormalities in CLS seems to be of significant importance.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: We extend our previous study of childhood leukaemia and proximity to high-voltage powerlines by including more recent data and cases and controls from Scotland, by considering 132-kV powerlines as well as 275 and 400 kV and by looking at greater distances from the powerlines. METHODS: Case-control study using 53,515 children from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours 1962-2008, matched controls, and calculated distances of mother address at child birth to powerlines at 132, 275, and 400 kV in England, Wales and Scotland. RESULTS: Our previous finding of an excess risk for leukaemia at distances out to 600 m declines over time. Relative risk and 95% confidence interval for leukaemia, 0-199 m compared with>1000 m, all voltages: 1960s 4.50 (0.97-20.83), 2000s 0.71 (0.49-1.03), aggregate over whole period 1.12 (0.90-1.38). Increased risk, albeit less strong, may also be present for 132-kV lines. Increased risk does not extend beyond 600 m for lines of any voltage. CONCLUSIONS: A risk declining over time is unlikely to arise from any physical effect of the powerlines and is more likely to be the result of changing population characteristics among those living near powerlines.\n",
      "High percentage of neoplastic cells in S, G2 and M phases of cell cycle is unfavourable prognostic sign in human haematological malignancies. In chronic leukaemias (CML and CLL) it is true for peripheral blood leukaemic cells, in non-Hodgkin lymphomas--for lymph node cells, in multiple myeloma--for bone marrow plasma cells. In acute leukaemia results are controversial: some authors found a correlation between proliferation parameters of bone marrow blast cells while others did not. These parameters correlate positively with the rate of complete remission and negatively with its duration. It is concluded that proliferation parameters of neoplastic cells may be used for individual prognosis in patients with haematological tumours especially in combination with other biological and clinical prognostic markers.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Clinical and imaging features of patients with orbital leukaemia primarily involving extraocular muscles were evaluated. METHODS: This retrospective case series includes patients with leukaemia whose only ophthalmic manifestation was extraocular muscle enlargement. Demographic data, clinical information on the systemic disease, prominent ocular signs and symptoms, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics, treatments applied and the outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Five patients were diagnosed as leukaemic infiltration of extraocular muscle between 1995 and 2008. The age at presentation ranged between 3 and 61 years. Acute myeloid leukaemia was the diagnosis in two patients, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia and biphenotypic acute leukaemia were found in one patient each, respectively. One patient had bilateral involvement. The lateral rectus muscle was affected in four patients and the superior rectus muscle in one case. Restricted ocular motility was the most common finding. In one patient who had no prior history of leukaemia, an incisional biopsy established the diagnosis. All patients received multi-agent chemotherapy. Four patients expired after a rapid decline of the systemic status within a mean period of 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Leukaemic infiltration of extraocular muscles is a rare and late manifestation of the advanced disease associated with relapse and there seems to be a predilection for the lateral rectus muscle. Systemic prognosis remains dismal despite intensive chemotherapy.\n",
      "Congenital leukaemia (CL) is a rare disorder that presents with extramedullary infiltrates and a myeloid phenotype. CL can progress rapidly without adequate treatment, but, paradoxically, may also remit spontaneously. Because of the significant toxicity involved in delivering chemotherapy to newborns, it is important to identify those newborns who may not require treatment. We describe an infant who presented at 1 week of age with congenital myeloid leukaemia. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a t(8;16)(q11;p13) translocation. The infant leukaemia underwent a spontaneous regression. This case further confirms the possibility of spontaneous remission in congenital leukaemia. Moreover, it suggests that the presence of a clonal cytogenetic aberration does not preclude the possibility of a spontaneous regression in CL.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia in the elderly is a disease with distinct biological properties, commonly associated with leukaemic cell treatment resistance and with an increased number of high-risk features, including concomitant myelodysplasia and poor-risk cytogenetic abnormalities such as monosomy 5 and 7. Complete remission rates after standard induction chemotherapy in patients above age 60 years are less than 50%, with long-term survival rates below 10%. Post-remission stem cell transplant therapies have not been studied extensively. Autologous transplants can result in an acceptable 3-year leukaemia-free survival rate of up to 47%, yet this procedure is applicable only to a small minority of patients. Myeloablative allogeneic transplants similarly show feasibility in selected few patients and in general are very toxic. Non-myeloablative allogeneic transplants are associated with reduced toxicity, but are plagued by an increased relapse rate. The latter strategy appears promising, but must be validated in larger, multi-centre prospective trials, in which outcomes are compared to non-transplant approaches.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Several studies have addressed the potential seasonality of childhood acute leukaemia (AL) without conclusive results. Using data from the National Registry of Childhood Cancers over 1990-2014 in mainland France, we investigated the seasonal variations in childhood AL taken together, and lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloid (AML) leukaemia separately. METHODS: Assuming constant variations over 1990-2014, we used a Poisson regression model to evaluate variations in standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) by month of birth or diagnosis. A scan method for temporal cluster detection was used to identify windows of several consecutive months with high or low SIR. The yearly reproducibility of the observed monthly variations was then evaluated. RESULTS: We included 11,528 AL, of which 9493 ALL and 1,843 AML. No seasonal variation was detected for ALL. With a clear seasonal pattern, differences in AML incidence rates were evidenced between January-April and May-December birth periods (SIR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94 and SIR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14, respectively). AML incidence variations by month of diagnosis were less clear-cut. CONCLUSION: Based on a large number of cases from a high-quality registry, we did not evidence any seasonality in ALL incidence rates but evidenced seasonal variations in AML incidence rates by month of birth.\n",
      "Oxidative stress as a result of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been observed in almost all cancers, including leukaemia, where they contribute to disease development and progression. However, cancer cells also express increased levels of antioxidant proteins which detoxify ROS. This includes glutathione, the major antioxidant in human cells, which has recently been identified to have dysregulated metabolism in human leukaemia. This suggests that critical balance of intracellular ROS levels is required for cancer cell function, growth, and survival. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) transcription factor plays a dual role in cancer. Primarily, NRF2 is a transcription factor functioning to protect nonmalignant cells from malignant transformation and oxidative stress through transcriptional activation of detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. However, once malignant transformation has occurred within a cell, NRF2 functions to protect the tumour from oxidative stress and chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, inhibition of the NRF2 oxidative stress pathway in leukaemia cells renders them more sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our improved understanding of NRF2 biology in human leukaemia may permit mechanisms by which we could potentially improve future cancer therapies. This review highlights the mechanisms by which leukaemic cells exploit the NRF2/ROS response to promote their growth and survival.\n",
      "The aim of this study consists in the measurement of psychological health and adaptation in mothers of children during the first 12 months of treatment for leukaemia and in the identification of possible early predictors. Ninety-four mothers were followed longitudinally at one week (T1), one month (T2), six months (T3) and 12 months (T4) post-diagnosis. The instruments used were: PTSD symptom checklist, BSI-18, Problem Scale, Ladder of life and an in-depth interview (EFI-C). Couple connectedness, family routine reorganisation, parental communication around the child illness and trust in the medical care significantly increased from T1 to T4. Two models are proposed concerning possible predictors of mothers' PTSS at T2 and at T3. Clinical suggestions are proposed on the basis of our empirical findings in order to plan informative, clinical and practical interventions for mothers of children under treatment for leukaemia.\n",
      "In order to investigate the incidence of pulmonary function complications following bone marrow transplantation (BMT), 17 patients with leukaemia and 8 with aplastic anaemia were sequentially assessed over a one year period. Before BMT, all the patients were free of respiratory symptoms and had both normal chest X-ray and routine lung function tests. However, 5 patients disclosed airway hyperreactivity. Aplastic anaemia patients had significantly lower haemoglobin-adjusted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) than those with leukaemia, a finding significantly related to the lower haemoglobin values shown in the former individuals. Following BMT there were transient mild to moderate reductions in DLCO and static lung volumes; moreover, patients with leukaemia had lower DLCO than those with aplastic anaemia. Fourteen of the 25 patients had ventilatory defects, including 10 individuals with bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Post-BMT lung function changes were transiently accompanied by mild to moderate symptoms of respiratory disease in most of the patients.\n",
      "The results of a geographical correlation study using Poisson regression analysis are reported for leukaemia and malignant lymphoma mortality between 1972 and 1997 in 100 selected Japanese municipalities with or without a nuclear power plant (NPP). The data did not support social concerns of an increased risk of malignant lymphoma in the vicinity of Japanese NPPs. However, some estimates of overall excess relative risk (ERR; relative risk minus one) were statistically significantly positive for leukaemia mortality in 20 NPP municipalities compared with mortality in the remaining 80 control areas, taking into account a minimum two-year latency following the start of commercial operation. One estimate was 0.228 (95% CI: 0.074-0.404) from a simple area adjustment using the mortality in all Japan as the external baseline rate. This superficial increase is not due to leukaemia among young people, aged less than 25 years at death. The ERR estimate for ages at death of 50-74 years was confounded to be positive for leukaemia and distorted to be negative for malignant lymphoma. For leukaemia, a positive ERR estimate was seen, especially for females and during specific periods. Confounding of the ERR estimate for two causes was also seen in some NPP areas including a high adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) area. Temporal area variations associated with ATL misclassification and a temporal increasing trend of leukaemia mortality in the elderly caused the confounding effects. Our findings do not support the hypothesis of a leukaemogenic impact of NPPs in Japan.\n",
      "Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are increasingly used to stimulate granulopoiesis in neutropenic patients but in most cases without any knowledge of the endogenous CSF-levels. With the purpose to define serum levels of GM-CSF and G-CSF during induction chemotherapy and haematological reconstitution in patients with acute leukaemia we have used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques to measure these growth factors in 18 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and eight patients with acute lymphoblastic or undifferentiated leukaemia (ALL/AUL). G-CSF above 0.05 ng/ml was detected in 54% of the analysed AML samples, median 0.29 (range 0.05-2.80) ng/ml; and in 40% of analysed ALL/AUL samples, median 0.09 (range 0.05-3.00) ng/ml. In patients with AML there was a clear correlation between an elevated serum concentration of G-CSF and documented infections. On the other hand, 15/18 of the patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and 8/8 patients with ALL/AUL had non-detectable levels of GM-CSF (less than 0.10 ng/ml). Two patients had measurable levels of GM-CSF in all samples, median 0.71 (range 0.26-1.18) ng/ml and in these patients the levels successively decreased during and after chemotherapy and did not increase in response to infections. In normals detectable levels of GM-CSF were found in 2/35 individuals and G-CSF in 0/10 individuals.\n",
      "A population-based study was carried out on 3,988 tumours in teenagers (aged 10-19 years) diagnosed during the period 1943-87 in Denmark and abstracted from the files of the National Cancer Registry. In that Registry, codes for tumours were based solely on topography until the end of 1977. In order to obtain a uniform data set, coded by the system of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) now used at the Cancer Registry, all cases of teenage cancer diagnosed prior to 1978 were re-evaluated, and an ICD-O code was applied. Tumours were further aggregated into diagnostic groups using an internationally agreed scheme. The average incidence rates for all histological types combined were 136 per million for boys and 108 per million for girls, which are close to those reported in Connecticut, USA. Central nervous system tumours, leukaemia and malignant lymphomas accounted for 60% of all cancers among teenagers. An overall excess of cancers among boys was mainly due to more frequent occurrence of leukaemias, malignant lymphomas, sarcomas and germ-cell tumours. Increasing trends with time were seen for malignant lymphomas in both boys and girls and for subtypes of non-seminoma germ-cell tumour among boys aged 15-19. For other diagnostic groups, including the main group of leukaemias, the rates have remained largely unchanged, suggesting that environmental factors associated with modern society play a minor role in the aetiology of cancer among teenagers.\n",
      "Chloroma, also called granulocytic sarcoma or myeloid sarcoma, is a rare malignant extramedullary neoplasm of myeloid precursor cells that occurs usually in association with acute myeloid leukaemia or blast phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The chloromas are regarded as an early herald of a systemic relapse, rather than as a localised process. The author reports a rare case of multiple skin chloromas in the chronic phase of CML. The patient was treated initially with hydroxyurea and chloromas disappeared. Patient has been followed for around three and half years and maintained in chronic stable phase on imatinib therapy.\n",
      "Disease recurrence following stem cell transplantation (SCT) remains a major problem. Despite the sensitivity of leukaemias to chemotherapy and irradiation, conventional conditioning before SCT is limited by significant organ toxicity. Targeted irradiation of bone marrow and spleen by radioimmunotherapy may provide considerable dose escalation, with limited toxicity to non-target organs. In this study, 27 patients with high-risk or relapsing leukaemia were treated with rhenium-188-labelled CD66a,b,c,e radioimmunoconjugates (188Re-mAb) specific for normal bone marrow in addition to conventional conditioning with high-dose chemotherapy and 12 Gy total body irradiation prior to SCT. A mean activity of 10.2+/-2.1 (range 6.9-15.8) GBq 188Re-mAb was administered intravenously. Acute side-effects were assessed according to the CTC classification and patient outcome was determined. Mean radiation doses (Gy; range in parentheses) to relevant organs and whole body were as follows: 13.1 (6.5-22) to bone marrow, 11.6 (1.7-31.1) to spleen, 5.0 (2.0-11.7) to liver, 7.0 (2.3-11.6) to kidneys, 0.7 (0.3-1.3) to lungs and 1.4 (0.8-2.1) to the whole body. Stem cells engrafted in all patients within 9-18 days post SCT. Acute organ toxicity of grade II or less was observed. During follow-up for 25.4+/-5.3 (range 18-34) months, 4/27 (15%) patients died from relapse, and 9/27 (33%) from transplantation-related complications. Fourteen patients (52%) are still alive and in ongoing complete clinical remission. Radioimmunotherapy with the bone marrow-seeking 188Re-labelled CD66 mAb can double the dose to bone marrow and spleen without undue extramedullary acute organ toxicity, when given in addition to high-dose chemotherapy and 12 Gy TBI before allogeneic SCT. This intensified conditioning regimen may reduce the relapse rate of high-risk leukaemia.\n",
      "Apaf-1 protein deficiency occurs in human leukaemic blasts and confers resistance to cytochrome-c-dependent apoptosis. Demethylation treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5aza2dc) increased the sensitivity of the K562 leukaemic cell line to UV light-induced apoptosis in association with increased Apaf-1 protein levels. There was no correlation between Apaf-1 protein expression and Apaf-1 mRNA levels after the demethylation treatment. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to show that the methylation can occur within the Apaf-1 promoter region in leukaemic blasts. Apaf-1 DNA methylation was demonstrated in acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoid leukaemia, suggesting that it is not specific to a particular leukaemia subtype. Apaf-1 protein expression did not correlate with Apaf-1 mRNA levels in human leukaemic blasts. Some leukaemic cells expressed high levels of Apaf-1 mRNA but low levels of Apaf-1 protein. This study suggests that Apaf-1 DNA promoter methylation might contribute to the inactivation of Apaf-1 expression. However, Apaf-1 protein levels might also be controlled at post-transcription level.\n",
      "Children with leukaemia exhibit multiple immunological disturbances, including low circulating levels of immunoglobulins, caused by both the disease and chemotherapy. We investigated the number of isotype-specific immunoglobulin-secreting cells (ISCs) in the bone marrow at the time of diagnosis in 32 children and during therapy in 12 children with leukaemia. We compared these to the number of ISCs in 17 untreated children with solid tumours and related the ISCs to serum immunoglobulin levels, lymphocyte subsets, response to mitogenic stimulation and serum cytokine levels. Bone marrow specimens were analysed for isotype-specific (immunoglobulins G, A and M) ISCs using the ELISPOT method. At the time of diagnosis, for all isotypes, the total number of ISCs per millilitre of bone marrow in children with leukaemia was no different from that in children with solid tumours. Chemotherapy significantly decreased the number of ISCs. The quantitative relationship between the different isotypes was unaffected by both tumour type and therapy. It can be concluded that in childhood leukaemia, tumour replacement of bone marrow cells does not cause a decreased number of ISCs and can therefore not account for the low serum immunoglobulin levels observed at time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy reduces the number of ISCs without changing the isotype distribution.\n",
      "The blood-related cancer leukaemia was the first disease where human CSCs (cancer stem cells), or LSCs (leukaemic stem cells), were isolated. The haematopoietic system is one of the best tissues for investigating CSCs, since the developmental hierarchy of normal blood formation is well defined. Leukaemia can now be viewed as aberrant haematopoietic processes initiated by rare LSCs that have maintained or reacquired the capacity for indefinite proliferation through accumulated mutations and/or epigenetic changes. Yet, despite their critical importance, much remains to be learned about the developmental origin of LSCs and the mechanisms responsible for their emergence in the course of the disease. This report will review our current knowledge on LSC development and finally demonstrate how these discoveries provide a paradigm for identification of CSCs from solid tumours.\n",
      "A 47-yr-old man with acute myeloid leukaemia had been in complete remission for 18 months when he developed a gingival tumour. Histological examination revealed leukaemic infiltrate and, at this stage, no other signs of relapse could be demonstrated. Chemotherapy and local radiotherapy resulted in the disappearance of the mass; however, histological abnormalities persisted. First relapse of acute myeloid leukaemia presenting as a gingival tumour has not been previously reported.\n",
      "AIM: Orbital granulocytic sarcoma is a localised tumour composed of cells of myeloid origin. Histological diagnosis can be difficult in patients with poorly differentiated orbital tumours and no evidence of systemic leukaemia. The naphthol AS-D chloracetate esterase (Leder stain) and immunohistochemical stains for lysozyme and MAC387 were used to determine the staining characteristics of these tumours. A case series of seven patients with orbital granulocytic sarcoma is presented. METHODS: Seven patients with orbital granulocytic sarcoma were studied. Haematoxylin and eosin, Leder, and lysozyme stained sections were available in seven cases. Unstained formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections of seven cases were available for immunohistochemical evaluation using the avidin-biotin-complex technique for MAC387. RESULTS: The mean age of presentation of the orbital tumour was 8.8 years. Four patients presented with an orbital tumour before any systemic manifestations of leukaemia. In two cases the diagnosis of the orbital tumour and systemic leukaemia was made simultaneously. There was one case of established systemic myeloid leukaemia in remission with the subsequent development of orbital granulocytic sarcoma. Six of seven cases (86%) were positive for the Leder stain. Five of seven cases (71%) showed positive immunoreactivity with lysozyme. The immunohistochemical stain for MAC387 was positive in all seven cases (100%) including one case that was negative for both lysozyme and Leder stains. CONCLUSIONS: Orbital granulocytic sarcoma is a tumour that affects children and can present with rapidly progressive proptosis. This tumour may develop before, during, or after the occurrence of systemic leukaemia. The combination of Leder and lysozyme stains is useful in the diagnosis of orbital granulocytic sarcoma. MAC387 may be a more reliable marker for orbital granulocytic sarcoma.\n",
      "Ponatinib (Iclusig, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals-Incyte Co.) is a third-generation structure-guided tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is approved for treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukaemias resistant or intolerant to other inhibitors. The clinical use of ponatinib is complicated by the possible development of cardiovascular events, primarily hypertension and arterial or venous thrombotic events. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency recommend that the cardiovascular profile of patients candidate for ponatinib should be carefully evaluated. For patients deemed to carry a high risk of cardiovascular events, other life-saving therapeutic options should be considered. When alternative options are not available, treatment with ponatinib is indicated but requires that haematologists and cardiologists collaborate and identify modalities of surveillance and risk mitigation in the best interest of the patient. This article reports on the expert opinion provided by a panel of Italian haematologists, cardiologists and clinical pharmacologists. It summarises suggestions that may help to improve the therapeutic index of ponatinib, primarily in the settings of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "The clinical status of a homogeneous cohort of long-term survivors of allogeneic marrow transplantation was assessed and residual leukaemia was studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for leukaemia specific BCR-ABL mRNA. The group comprised 34 consecutive patients with CML in chronic phase treated by chemoradiotherapy and transplantation of bone marrow from HLA-identical sibling donors between February 1981 and December 1983 in the joint Hammersmith-Northwick Park programme. The probability of survival at 10 years was 59 +/- 17%. Eighteen of the 19 surviving (95%) patients have Karnofsky scores of 90 or 100% indicative of a good performance status. One of the survivors had evidence of relapse 6.5 years after transplant but has since been restored to complete remission by treatment with interferon-alpha followed by donor leucocyte transfusions. Surprisingly, 2 of the 19 patients who have been in remission for over 10 years have molecular evidence of persisting leukaemic cells. Quantification by competitive PCR indicated that the malignant clone persisted at low levels. The data suggest that the majority of long-term survivors after BMT for CML are in good health and may be regarded as cured. Some long-term survivors, however, may still harbour residual leukaemic cells and continued monitoring for late relapse is warranted. Late relapse is amenable to further therapy with leukocyte transfusions from the original marrow donor.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that, among other factors, comorbidity may be an important prognostic variable in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who are eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the overall survival (OS) and underlying risk factors in 45 adult patients with MDS (n = 38), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (n = 1), or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) arising from MDS (n = 6), who underwent allogeneic SCT at our Institution. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 37 months, OS for all patients was 23%, post-transplant relapse occurred in 11 patients, and 10 patients died from treatment-related complications. The overall outcome and survival was independent of cytogenetic abnormalities and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). However, we identified comorbidity as defined by the haematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), as a significant adverse prognostic variable in our MDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data and similar published data we recommend selecting patients with MDS or secondary AML for SCT according to the presence of comorbidities.\n",
      "Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), a disorder belonging to the group of myelodysplastic syndromes, has a number of peculiar features which raise the question as to whether it should be considered a distinct entity in its own right. The problems associated with its classification and diagnosis are discussed in this report using all currently available tools from clinical data to molecular genetics, including morphology, histology, cellular biology and cytogenetics. Three groups of patients can be identified (isolated monocytosis with a mild degree of dysplasia, severe cytopenia and the most frequent type with proliferative symptoms dominating the clinical picture). The latter group is close to atypical chronic myeloid leukaemia and perhaps these two entities should be regarded as a single one. Classification of the disease is further complicated by the possibility of evolution from one subgroup into another one and by the finding that CMML can also arise as a disorder secondary to other myeloproliferative (MPS) or myelodysplastic (MDS) syndromes. No specific marker of the disease has been identified by cytogenetics or molecular biology. Due to all these facts, we believe that CMML should perhaps be viewed more pragmatically by considering the use of prognostic factors that could at least help to define different groups of patients who may require different therapeutic strategies. We conclude that CMML is a heterogeneous syndrome with features of both MPS and MDS, encompassing primary and secondary stem cell disorders and varying widely in its clinical presentation. This heterogeneity should stimulate the search for reliable predictors of evolution which would allow a better definition of CMML subtypes based on prognostic factors.\n",
      "Three cases of skin infection, two with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one with Staphylococcus aureus in three adolescents with acute leukaemia are described. In all cases the infection was clearly related to the latest fashion in shoes. This report underline the fact that factors related to everyday life and less frequently considered than those related to the underlying illness can also put increase the risk of developing severe infections in immunocompromised patients.\n",
      "Constitutional dominant loss-of-function mutations in the SPRED1 gene cause a rare phenotype referred as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-like syndrome or Legius syndrome, consisted of multiple café-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, learning disabilities and macrocephaly. SPRED1 is a negative regulator of the RAS MAPK pathway and can interact with neurofibromin, the NF1 gene product. Individuals with NF1 have a higher risk of haematological malignancies. SPRED1 is highly expressed in haematopoietic cells and negatively regulates haematopoiesis. SPRED1 seemed to be a good candidate for leukaemia predisposition or transformation. We performed SPRED1 mutation screening and expression status in 230 paediatric lymphoblastic and acute myeloblastic leukaemias (AMLs). We found a loss-of-function frameshift SPRED1 mutation in a patient with Legius syndrome. In this patient, the leukaemia blasts karyotype showed a SPRED1 loss of heterozygosity, confirming SPRED1 as a tumour suppressor. Our observation confirmed that acute leukaemias are rare complications of the Legius syndrome. Moreover, SPRED1 was significantly decreased at RNA and protein levels in the majority of AMLs at diagnosis compared with normal or paired complete remission bone marrows. SPRED1 decreased expression correlated with genetic features of AML. Our study reveals a new mechanism which contributes to deregulate RAS MAPK pathway in the vast majority of paediatric AMLs.\n",
      "We report a case of acute leukaemia occurring early in the course of IgA multiple myeloma. Ultrastructural studies, immunophenotyping and karyotyping were required to identify the origin and clonality of the leukaemic cells. Although ultrastructural examination of the blast cells revealed both monocytoid and plasma cell features, all cells expressed the CD 38 antigen and intracytoplasmic kappa light chains, while karyotyping revealed a clone with numerous abnormalities, leading to the diagnosis of clonal plasma cell disease. The occurrence of leukaemia in multiple myeloma is discussed.\n",
      "An increased incidence of leukaemia and NHL has been recorded close to Britain two nuclear reprocessing sites at Sellafield in West Cumbria and Dounreay in Northern Scotland. Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain the excesses - paternal preconceptional irradiation (PPI) and an infective basis promoted by population mixing. Subsequent studies have provided no support for the PPI hypothesis and have also shown that this was derived from the analysis of a sub-group. In contrast, support for the population mixing hypothesis has come from a series of studies of residential and occupational situations. One of these showed that the excess near Dounreay was part of a wider increase in rural areas of Scotland affected by the unusual mixing associated with away-from-home work in the North Sea oil industry, being more marked in areas of relatively high social class. It is probable that the excess in Seascale is due to related demographic factors, this parish being extreme in its high social class, geographic isolation and its proximity to Sellafield, the largest, most changing industrial site in rural Britain.\n",
      "Serum selenium concentration as an indicator of selenium status was studied during a 6-month period in 24 children with acute leukaemia or solid tumours. At diagnosis low serum selenium values were found in children with acute leukaemia compared to children with solid tumours (P = 0.001), while there were no differences in the protein nutritional status of these children as assessed by serum albumin and prealbumin. During the corticosteroid treatment serum selenium levels increased (mean of 111 per cent) in children with acute leukaemia. The concentrations of serum selenium remained within the reference range of healthy Finnish children from week 16 onwards in children with acute leukaemia and throughout the study period of 24 weeks in children with solid tumours. The results suggest redistribution of the endogenous selenium stores since no selenium supplementation was used, and demonstrate that serum selenium is not a valid indicator of selenium status in these cases.\n",
      "Among the cytostatic drugs only the alkylating agents have been firmly established as being leukaemogenic. This report describes 4 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia and 1 of myelodysplasia occurring in a cohort of 212 patients with germ-cell tumours treated with etoposide, cisplatin, and bleomycin. The mean cumulative risk of leukaemic complications was 4.7% (SE 2.3) 5.7 years after start of etoposide-containing chemotherapy, and, compared with the risk in the general population, the relative risk of overt leukaemia was 336 (95% CI 92-861). No leukaemias were detected in a previous cohort of 127 patients with germ-cell tumours treated with cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine. The increased risk of leukaemia was most probably due to etoposide alone or in combination with cisplatin or bleomycin, since other published work has also not revealed an excess of leukaemias among patients with germ-cell tumours treated with only cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine. The risk of leukaemia was dose related since all 5 patients with leukaemic complications were among the 82 who had received a cumulative dose of more than 2000 mg/m2 etoposide, whereas no leukaemias were observed among 130 patients who had received up to 2000 mg/m2 (p = 0.004). 3 of the leukaemic patients had balanced chromosome translocations affecting bands 11q23 and 21q22. These translocations, and perhaps also other balanced aberrations, seem to be characteristic of myelodysplasia and acute leukaemia occurring after therapy with cytostatic agents acting on DNA-topoisomerase II.\n",
      "The CBA/H mouse model of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia (rAML) has been studied for decades to bring to light the molecular mechanisms associated with multistage carcinogenesis. A specific interstitial deletion of chromosome 2 found in a high proportion of rAML is recognised as the initiating event. The deletion leads to the loss of Sfpi, a gene essential for haematopoietic development. Its product, the transcription factor PU.1 acts as a tumour suppressor in this model. Although the deletion can be detected early following ionising radiation exposure by cytogenetic techniques, precise characterisation of the haematopoietic cells carrying the deletion and the study of their fate in vivo cannot be achieved. Here, using a genetically engineered C57BL/6 mouse model expressing the GFP fluorescent molecule under the control of the Sfpi1 promoter, which we have bred onto the rAML-susceptible CBA/H strain, we demonstrate that GFP expression did not interfere with X-ray induced leukaemia incidence and that GFP fluorescence in live leukaemic cells is a surrogate marker of radiation-induced chromosome 2 deletions with or without point mutations on the remaining allele of the Sfpi1 gene. This study presents the first experimental evidence for the detection of this leukaemia initiating event in live leukemic cells.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Although the characteristics of leukaemia in patients with Down syndrome (DS) have been well documented, little is known about the long-term results of treatment. METHOD: Retrospectively from 1968 to 1981 and prospectively from 1982 to 2002, the present authors collected data on every child with DS in Finland who had been diagnosed with leukaemia between 1968 and 1994. RESULTS: Forty-one children with DS had acute leukaemia: 28 had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL); and 13 had acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL). The median age of the subjects at diagnosis was 3.8 years (range = 0-15.9 years). Patients with ANLL were significantly younger (P = 0.001) and all patients under 2 years of age had ANLL. Out of the 28 patients with ALL, 23 (82%) entered primary remission, and of these 23 individuals, 10 remained alive and in continuous remission (CR) after a median of 11.6 years (range = 8.9-20.0 years). Out of the 13 patients with ANLL, five (38%) entered remission and four remained in CR after a median of 16.0 years (range = 9.1-19.2 years). Treatment -related toxicities were common: eight patients with ALL and two with ANLL died of septicaemia. Actuarial, event-free survival rates at 5 years were 53% and 43% for adequately treated subjects with ALL and ANLL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Standard leukaemia chemotherapy is effective in patients with DS. However, because toxicities are unacceptably frequent, specific anti-leukaemia regimens are needed for subjects with DS design.\n",
      "AIMS: Spurious platelet counts can be found in acute leukaemias, as a result of the fragmentation of blood cells. Microscopic examination of a blood smear should be performed to detect the presence of these so called pseudoplatelets. When present, the platelet count should be corrected because of the important clinical consequences that a lower platelet count may have in these patients. METHODS: K(3)EDTA anticoagulated blood was measured on an automated blood cell counter, and a blood smear was made and stained according the May Grünwald-Giemsa method for microscopic observation. A 500 cell/particle differentiation was performed and the automated platelet count was corrected. RESULTS: The incidence of pseudoplatelets in 169 patients with acute leukaemia was studied. Pseudoplatelets were detected in 43 patients (25.4%), and seven patients (4.1%) were re-classified as having a major bleeding risk (platelet count, < 15 x 10(9)/litre). CONCLUSIONS: Platelets should be determined morphologically in patients with acute leukaemia and a routine screening method for the detection of pseudoplatelets should be developed.\n",
      "It is well known that solid cancers are associated with thromboembolic complications, but recent studies have shown that the incidence of thrombosis may be as high (or even higher) in patients with malignant haematological disorders. However, this may be obscured by the significant morbidity and mortality due to other complications of haematological malignancies, such as bleeding and infections. The vast majority of patients with haematological neoplasias also have clinically silent haemostatic abnormalities, but some may show clinical manifestations, including venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation and life-threatening thrombohaemorrhagic syndrome in acute leukaemias. The pathogenesis of thromboembolic disease in haematological malignancies is complex and multifactorial: tumour cell-derived procoagulant, fibrinolytic or proteolytic factors and inflammatory cytokines affect clotting activation, and chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs increase thrombotic risk in patients with lymphoma, acute leukaemia and multiple myeloma. Infectious complications are another important factor: endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria induce the release of tissue factor (TF), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b), and gram-positive organisms can release bacterial mucopolysaccharides that directly activate factor XII. Leukaemic patients may be affected by other prothrombotic factors, including hyperleukocytosis, increased TF expression and activation, and the prothrombotic properties of therapeutic agents such as all-trans retinoic acid and L-asparaginase, which can induce thrombosis involving multiple organs. The very high risk of haemorrhaging in these patients warrants prospective randomised trials evaluating optimal anti-thrombotic prophylaxis and treatment.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Studies of a provisional entity pre-clinical chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), which precedes chronic phase (CP) without leucocytosis or blood/marrow feature of CML CP, has been increasing. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of pre-clinical CML and analysis the data relevant to disease progression to CML CP. METHOD: We performed a literature search on 16 July 2017 using EBSCOhost Research Databases interface and Western Pacific Region Index Medicus. Two authors selected the studies, extracted the data and evaluated the quality of studies using an 8-item tool, independently. The outcomes were percentage of Philadelphia chromosome in the number of metaphases examined (Ph%), correlation between Ph% and blood count and time progress to CML. RESULT: Our initial search returned 4770 studies. A total of 10 studies with a total 17 subjects were included. The lowest Ph%, which eventually progresses to CML, was 10%. Absolute basophil count seemed to correlate better with Ph% compared to total white cell and absolute eosinophil count. The time from the first documented pre-clinical CML to CML ranged from 12 to 48 months. The overall quality of the included studies was average. CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic review on pre-clinical CML. This entity requires additional large-scale studies.\n",
      "Mouse radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) which arose in a (CBA/H x C57BL/6) genetic background have a 45% incidence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 4. Frequent chromosome 4 LOH in mouse radiation-induced (C57BL/6 x RF/J) thymic lymphomas (TLs) is associated with promoter/exon 1 region hypermethylation of the remaining p15INK4b and p16INK4a alleles, so this may be common to mouse radiation myeloid and lymphoid leukaemogenesis. We addressed the question of p15INK4b/p16INK4a/p19ARF gene promoter hypermethylation in radiation-induced AMLs by comparison to TLs which arose in a similar (C57BL/6 x CBA/H) genetic background as a consequence of the same initiating dose of 3 Gy X-rays. Only one homozygous deletion was detected in the approximately 100 leukaemias analysed. p15INK4b gene promoter/exon 1 hypermethylation was readily detected (21%) in the lymphoid but not myeloid (3.1%) leukaemias, and p16INK4a and p19ARF gene promoter/exon 1 methylation was rare (<3%) in both. Thus, allelic loss and promoter hypermethylation of the p15INK4b gene is particular to radiation-induced lymphoid leukaemias and is independent of p16INK4a and p19ARF gene promoter/exon 1 hypermethylation.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Immunophenotypic characterization of the leukemic cells has been widely used as a tool for diagnosis, classification, stratification and prognosis of leukaemia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immunophenotypic subtype profiles of Iranian patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its association to disease outcome. METHODS: In this study, a total of 60 Iranian patients with ALL were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD13, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD33, CD34, CD45, HLA-DR and TdT molecules. RESULTS: The samples were initially categorized into T-ALL (n=9), B-ALL (n=50) and mixed lineage (n=1) based on the expression patterns of CD3 and CD19 molecules. B-ALL patients could further be classified into four subtypes, including Pro-B (n=7, 11.7%), Pre-B I (n=28, 46.7%), Pre-B II (n=13, 21.7%) and immature/mature B cells (n=2, 3.3%) on the basis of expression of CD10, CD19, CD20, HLA-DR and TdT. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of the patients did not reveal association with immunophenotypic subtypes of ALL, with the exception of mediastinal mass and WBC count at the time of diagnosis which were found to be significantly higher in patients with T-ALL compared with B-ALL (p=0.001 and 0.014), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that overall the immunophenotypic profile of Iranian ALL patients is similar to previous reports and it might be used for monitoring of minimal residual disease and prognosis.\n",
      "Priapism is known as a very rare complication of leukaemia. We report a 16-years boy who presented with the persistent painful erection of the penis for eleven days. He had aspiration without achieving sustained detumescence. The patient underwent an emergency irrigation and decompression of priapism by a consultant urologist. During the hospital stay blood morphology, bone marrow aspiration and BCR-ABL were done to confirm the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Our report thus explains the relevance of all physicians in the diagnosis and management of patients with priapism.\n",
      "Mutations of Nucleophosmin (NPM1) are the most common genetic abnormalities in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), accounting for about 30% of cases. NPM1-mutated AML has been recognized as distinct entity in the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lympho-haematopoietic neoplasms. WHO criteria allow recognition of this leukaemia entity and its distinction from AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, AML with BCR-ABL1 rearrangement and AML with RUNX1 mutations. Nevertheless, controversial issues include the percentage of blasts required for the diagnosis of NPM1-mutated AML and whether cases of NPM1-mutated myelodysplasia and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia do exist. Evaluation of NPM1 and FLT3 status represents a major pillar of the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) genetic-based risk stratification model. Moreover, NPM1 mutations are particularly suitable for assessing measurable residual disease (MRD) since they are frequent, stable at relapse and do not drive clonal haematopoiesis. Ideally, combining monitoring of MRD with the ELN prognostication model can help to guide therapeutic decisions. Here, we provide examples of instructive cases of NPM1-mutated AML, in order to provide criteria for the appropriate diagnosis and therapy of this frequent leukaemia entity.\n",
      "Large collections of data in studies on cancer such as leukaemia provoke the necessity of applying tailored analysis algorithms to ensure supreme information extraction. In this work, a custom-fit pipeline is demonstrated for thorough investigation of the voluminous MILE gene expression data set. Three analyses are accomplished, each for gaining a deeper understanding of the processes underlying leukaemia types and subtypes. First, the main disease groups are tested for differential expression against the healthy control as in a standard case-control study. Here, the basic knowledge on molecular mechanisms is confirmed quantitatively and by literature references. Second, pairwise comparison testing is performed for juxtaposing the main leukaemia types among each other. In this case by means of the Dice coefficient similarity measure the general relations are pointed out. Moreover, lists of candidate main leukaemia group biomarkers are proposed. Finally, with this approach being successful, the third analysis provides insight into all of the studied subtypes, followed by the emergence of four leukaemia subtype biomarkers. In addition, the class enhanced DEG signature obtained on the basis of novel pipeline processing leads to significantly better classification power of multi-class data classifiers. The developed methodology consisting of batch effect adjustment, adaptive noise and feature filtration coupled with adequate statistical testing and biomarker definition proves to be an effective approach towards knowledge discovery in high-throughput molecular biology experiments.\n",
      "Alterations in neoplastic cell behaviour responsible for increased production of terminally-differentiated granulocytes during long-term culture of bone marrow in different categories of acute leukaemia and myelodysplasia have been investigated. An increase in neutrophils associated with transition to a morphological picture identical to normal control cultures occurred in 15 of 25 studies on acute leukaemia in contrast to one of six studies on myelodysplastic disorders. An abnormal neoplastic karyotype was employed as a marker for monitoring the course of the neoplastic cell population in 11 studies in which there was progression towards a normal pattern of differentiation. An increase in differentiation was shown by this means to represent increased maturation of cells of the neoplastic process in one study on a myelodysplastic disorder, demonstrating domination of proliferative activity in culture by all of the myelodysplastic disorders examined. Transition towards normal differentiation in nine studies on acute leukaemia, however, correlated with partial or complete replacement of the acute leukaemic cells by normal haemopoietic series in de novo acute leukaemia, and by Ph positive cells in blast crisis of CML. Conversion to morphologically and cytogenetically normal cell populations in five studies on de novo acute leukaemia occurred in four cases which failed to respond to remission-induction therapy, suggesting the selective toxic effect capable of purging acute leukaemic cells from bone marrow operated by a mechanism which lacked cross-resistance to currently-employed cytotoxic agents.\n",
      "Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are distinct clinicopathological B cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD). Both diseases have characteristic immunophenotypic and molecular features. The co-existence of two B-CLPD is perhaps more common than previously thought but a composite HCL and CLL has been rarely documented. A case is reported in which the morphology, integrated with an extensive immunophenotyping panel, and incorporation of the recently described HCL-associated BRAF V600E mutation, enabled the prompt diagnosis of composite HCL and CLL thus allowing appropriate treatment selection. This case serves to highlight the benefit of a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis of bi-clonal B-CLPD.\n",
      "With increasingly sophisticated chemotherapy regimes being prescribed the quality of life of cancer patients has become a key outcome measure. Little has been reported concerning the experience of patients with haematological malignancy receiving chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of a novel quality of life measure-the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW) in a sample of patients with either leukaemia or lymphoma. Fifty-one patients from the haematology clinic and in-patient unit at The Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital completed the SEIQoL-DW; in addition, each patient completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and a ten item questionnaire covering aspects of their treatment and satisfaction with information provided. The practical application of the SEIQoL-DW is described and two patients quality of life profiles are illustrated for comparison. The relationship between quality of life, satisfaction with information provided and psychological distress as measured by the HADS is discussed.\n",
      "Our study is aimed at investigating the association between common childhood infectious diseases (measles, chickenpox, rubella, mumps and pertussis) and the risk of developing leukaemia in an adult population. A reanalysis of a large population-based case-control study was carried out. Original data included 1,771 controls and 649 leukaemia cases from 11 Italian areas. To contain recall bias, the analysis was restricted to subjects directly interviewed and with a good quality interview (1,165 controls and 312 cases). Odds ratios (ORs) and their related 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by unconditional polychotomous logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender and occupational and lifestyle exposures. A protective effect of at least one infection (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.97), measles (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39-0.82) and pertussis (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.98) was observed for chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL). The number of infections was strongly inversely associated with the risk of CLL (p = 0.002, test for trend). With regard to the other types of leukaemia, only a protective effect of pertussis was observed for AML (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.32-0.87). Our results pointed out a protective role of childhood infectious diseases on the risk of CLL in adults. Although a specific antioncogenic effect of some infectious disease, especially measles, cannot be ruled out, the observed decrease of risk with increasing number of infections suggests that a more general \"hygiene hypothesis\" could be the most likely explanation of the detected association. The protective role of pertussis remains to be elucidated.\n",
      "Data from a national case-control study are used to explore the relationships between childhood leukaemia, infant infection and three markers of infectious exposure - birth order, infant-activity group attendance and area-based deprivation. Amongst controls, clinically diagnosed infection in the first year varied little with birth order and infant-activity group attendance - with 4 in 5 children having at least one infection, and each child averaging around 2.9 (2.8-3.0). Amongst cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the levels of infection increased as the indices of infectious exposure increased - for example, odds ratios associated with at least one infection in the first year being 0.9 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6-1.4) for birth order one and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.2) for birth order two or more. By contrast, interview data were misleading, with mothers - particularly case mothers - consistently under-reporting. We conclude that the findings based on clinical data, combined with the markers of infectious exposure, confirm the observation that immune dysregulation among children who develop ALL is detectable from an early age.\n",
      "The interactions of five different lectins: peanut (PNA), lentil (LEN), wheat germ (WGA), soybean (SBA), Asparagus pea (FBP) with leukaemic cells obtained from 31 children: 25 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 6 with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) were examined in this study. The relationship of lectin-binding ability to cells cytomorphological, cytochemical and immunological features and its potential clinical application were investigated. It has been shown that PNA and LEN receptors were found in the majority of blast cells. The SBA reacting cells were found only in few patients and FBP binding was not found in studied ALL and AML cells. There was a clear difference in the WGA binding capacity in ALL cells with L1 and L2 characteristics respectively. No differences were found in PNA. WGA and LEN reactivity between PAS negative and PAS positive leukaemic cells. Only PNA of all studied lectins seemed to differentiate T- from B-ALL blast cells. Only WGA binding of ALL cells showed the positive correlation to the risk index value.\n",
      "A 62-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with suspected acute leukaemia and after investigation we diagnosed acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML-M1). The patient blood type was found to be the very rare Bombay type and surveillance of her relatives showed the same blood type in her male cousin on her mother side. Alongside chemotherapy the patient received 4000 ml of frozen Bombay-type red cells, 1400 ml of concentrated red cells in manitol adenine phosphate solutions and 360 units of type O concentrated platelets without marked effects. The anti-H antibody was initially at 128 dilution but for unknown reasons increased to 2048 dilution after remission of AML-M1. About 3 months after hospitalization the patient died of Cryptococcus neoformans pneumonia despite strict precautions against infection. Although AML-M1 is a common adult leukaemia and is chemosensitive to anti-leukaemic drugs, neither AML-M1 in a patient with Bombay-type red cells nor its treatment with chemotherapy and transfusion with type Oh frozen red cells have previously been reported.\n",
      "More than a decade of experimental work in an inbred subline of Sprague-Dawley rats having high incidence of spontaneous T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia is reviewed. Longitudinal follow-up of biological characteristics (growth, survival, haematology) of both multiple cases of primary disease and s.c. passaged lymphomas as well as comparative immunophenotypic and karyotypic studies are concluded. In these T-cell lymphomas (mostly CD4 positive), arising on the same genetic background of the inbred SD strain, the aberrations involving chromosome 11 have been recognized as a typical non-random cytogenetic marker. This unique rat model of lymphoblastic lymphomas/leukaemias, relevant to human pathology, seems to be very suitable for testing different anticancer therapeutic strategies, as it is documented by results of a number of various protocols conducted in our laboratory.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Abandonment of therapy is a significant cause of paediatric cancer treatment failure in low- to middle-income countries (LMIC), but its impact has been underestimated. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the magnitude of abandonment in paediatric leukaemia in LMIC and sought to identify patient-, centre- and country-specific predictors of abandonment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched seven databases to identify paediatric oncology cohorts followed up from diagnosis and treated in LMIC. All languages were included. Two reviewers independently selected articles and extracted data. Authors were contacted for additional information. Subgroup analyses were planned a priori. RESULTS: Of 22,384 publications, 318 in eight languages met criteria for full text review. 157 studies met analysis inclusion criteria. Abandonment rates (ARs), obtained for 83 of the 157 studies (52.9%), ranged from 0% to 74.5%. ARs were frequently unreported and available only directly from authors. Forty studies (10,494 children in 20 countries) were quantitatively analysed. ARs for acute lymphoblastic laeukemia in lower-middle-income countries (lower-MICs) were higher than in upper-middle-income countries (29%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23-36% versus 2%, 95% CI 1-3%; p<0.0001) but were heterogeneous (I(2)=98%; p<0.0001). This heterogeneity was not explained by centre-specific (free versus paid treatment) or country-specific (government health expenditure, per-capital income) subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In LMICs, ARs are highest in lower-MICs. However, their broad range suggests that low ARs are possible in resource-constrained settings. Analysis of outliers may suggest interventions for use at other centres. Methodologically appropriate reporting of ARs should be adopted. Future research should evaluate interventions targeting abandonment.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is the leading form of fatal acute leukaemia in adults. AML is a heterogeneous disease with respect to responsible mutations and chromosomal abnormalities as well as to their clinicopathological image. In recent years, great progress has been made in techniques allowing detection of genetic changes in both de novo AML and in secondary AML induced by other haematological disorders or therapy, and in detection of residual disease after therapy. Accumulated knowledge allowed better understanding of the molecules and mechanisms involved not only in the formation and expansion of a primary leukaemia-founding clone, but also of a temporal order of changes leading to the fully malignant phenotype. The recent knowledge of bone marrow (BM) compartments and interrelations among various BM resident and recruited cell types helps in understanding the AML development. The progress in the techniques and knowledge will result in the development and use of molecularly targeted therapies tailored to individual patient needs.\n",
      "The retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) protein plays a central role in myeloid differentiation, and chromosomal translocations disrupting the RAR alpha gene are implicated in the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). To identify haemopoietic malignant disorders which may also be linked to RAR alpha abnormalities, Southern blot analysis was performed in DNA from 153 patients with haematological malignancies other than AML FAB type M3 using RAR alpha cDNA probes. Alterations of RAR alpha were detected in 1/42 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 2/24 AML, 3/47 B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (B-CLL), 0/40 lymphomas and 0/60 normal individuals. These data strongly suggest that alterations of RAR alpha might predispose for myeloid and lymphoid disorders.\n",
      "We describe an unusual occurrence of bilateral conjunctival tumours in a 25-year-old woman. This was the first sign of relapse of acute monoblastic leukaemia. There was also both marrow relapse and subsequent skin infiltration. No central nervous system involvement was detected. The tumours appeared as pink raised lesions in the upper conjunctivae of both eyes. They were not associated with pain or visual impairment. Conjunctival tumour biopsy revealed a dense mononuclear cell infiltration. Complete remission (conjunctival tumours, skin infiltration and bone marrow) was attained following systemic chemotherapy in combination with intrathecal chemotherapy.\n",
      "Besides having a pivotal biological function as a component of coenzymes, riboflavin appears a promissing antitumoral agent, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that irradiated riboflavin, when applied at microM concentrations, induces an orderly sequence of signaling events finally leading to leukemia cell death. The molecular mechanism involved is dependent on the activation of caspase 8 caused by overexpression of Fas and FasL and also on mitochondrial amplification mechanisms, involving the stimulation of ceramide production by sphingomyelinase and ceramide synthase. The activation of this cascade led to an inhibition of mitogen activated protein kinases: JNK, MEK and ERK and survival mediators (PKB and IAP1), upregulation of the proapoptotic Bcl2 member Bax and downregulation of cell cycle progression regulators. Importantly, induction of apoptosis by irradiated riboflavin was leukaemia cell specific, as normal human lymphocytes did not respond to the compound with cell death. Our data indicate that riboflavin selectively activates Fas cascade and also constitutes a death receptor-engaged drug without harmful side effects in normal cells, bolstering the case for using this compound as a novel avenue for combating cancerous disease.\n",
      "The objective of this study was to evaluate the ecological association between indoor radon concentration and acute leukaemia incidence among children under 15 years of age in the 348 geographical units (zones d'emploi, ZE) of France between 1990 and 1998. During that period, 4015 cases were registered by the French National Registry of Childhood Leukaemia and Lymphoma. Exposure assessment was based on a campaign of 13 240 measurements covering the whole country. The arithmetic mean radon concentration was 85 Bq/m (range, 15-387 Bq/m) and the geometric mean, 59 Bq/m (range: 13-228 Bq/m). A positive ecological association, on the borderline of statistical significance (P=0.053), was observed between indoor radon concentration and childhood leukaemia incidence. The association was highly significant for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (P=0.004) but not for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) (P=0.49). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) increased by 7, 3 and 24% for all acute leukaemia, ALL and AML, respectively, when radon concentration increased by 100 Bq/m. In conclusion, the present ecological study supports the hypothesis of a moderate association between indoor radon concentration and childhood acute myeloid leukaemia. It is consistent with most previous ecological studies. Since the association is moderate, this result does not appear inconsistent with the five published case-control studies, most of which found no significant association.\n",
      "To clarify the clinical and biological significance of serum thymidine kinase (TK) in adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) associated with human lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) and in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), TK was measured in 52 patients with ATL (acute ATL, 35 patients; lymphoma ATL, two patients; chronic ATL, 12 patients; smouldering ATL, three patients), and in 27 patients with AML (one FAB MO, one M1, 10 M2, seven M3, five M4, one M5, one M6, one MU). In ATL patients, statistical analysis disclosed a close correlation between TK level and the leucocyte count (P < 0.01), and absolute number of abnormal lymphocytes (P < 0.01). However, no correlation was observed between serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level and these items. Concerning the therapeutic response, a statistical difference was present in TK between complete remission and no response (P < 0.05), but not in LDH. We also investigated a significant inverse correlation between TK level as well as LDH level and the length of survival after the initial diagnosis (P < 0.01). In AML patients a close correlation of TK level with the count of leucocytes (P < 0.01), percentage of blasts in the blood (P < 0.05), therapeutic response (P < 0.01) and the length of survival after the initial diagnosis (P < 0.05) was present. Therefore the TK level may indicate the aggressiveness of leukaemic cells and predict the response to the chemotherapy and the length of survival in ATL and AML.\n",
      "Data on occurrence, genetic characteristics and prognostic impact of complex and monosomal karyotype (CK/MK) in children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are scarce. We studied CK and MK in a large unselected cohort of childhood AML patients diagnosed and treated according to Nordic Society for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO)-AML protocols 1993-2015. In total, 800 patients with de novo AML were included. CK was found in 122 (15%) and MK in 41 (5%) patients. CK and MK patients were young (median age 2·1 and 3·3 years, respectively) and frequently had FAB M7 morphology (24% and 22%, respectively). Refractory disease was more common in MK patients (15% vs. 4%) and stem cell transplantation in first complete remission was more frequent (32% vs. 19%) compared with non-CK/non-MK patients. CK showed no association with refractory disease but was an independent predictor of an inferior event-free survival (EFS; hazard ratio [HR] 1·43, P = 0·03) and overall survival (OS; HR 1·48, P = 0·01). MK was associated with a poor EFS (HR 1·57, P = 0·03) but did not show an inferior OS compared to non-MK patients (HR 1·14, P = 0·62). In a large paediatric cohort, we characterized AML with non-recurrent abnormal karyotype and unravelled the adverse impact of CK and MK on prognosis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Infant leukaemia (IL) is extremely rare with fewer than 150 cases occurring each year in the United States. Little is known about its causes. However, recent evidence supports a role of de novo mutations in IL aetiology. Parental age has been associated with several adverse outcomes in offspring, including childhood cancers. Given the role of older parental age in de novo mutations in offspring, we carried out an analysis of parental age and IL. METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between parental age and IL in a case-control study using registry data from New York, Minnesota, California, Texas, and Washington. Records from 402 cases [219 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 131 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and 52 other] and 45 392 controls born during 1981-2004 were analysed. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by logistic regression. Estimates were adjusted for infant sex, birth year category, maternal race, state, and mutually adjusted for paternal or maternal age, respectively. RESULTS: Infants with mothers' age ≥40 years had an increased risk of developing AML (OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.80, 12.76). In contrast, paternal age <20 was associated with increased risk of ALL (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.62, 8.41). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates increased risk of infant ALL in relation to young paternal age. Given record linkage, there is little concern with recall or selection bias, although data are lacking on MLL gene status and other potentially important variables. Parent of origin effects, de novo mutations, and/or carcinogenic exposures may be involved in IL aetiology.\n",
      "Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) consists of fragments of double stranded DNA that are found in the circulation. They are released from the apoptosis of both normal haemopoietic cells and malignant cells. The use of cfDNA from easily accessible peripheral blood samples has created a new strategy in studying molecular genomics in haematological malignancies. Its use in diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring potentially precludes the need for repeated tissue samples, i.e., bone marrow biopsy or primary tissue biopsy. It also potentially provides a more comprehensive analysis of the disease as cfDNA are released from tumours from multiple sites of the body. While cfDNA research is still in its infancy, given its potential and the expansion in next generation sequencing (NGS) it has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. This review will focus on acute leukaemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma and the potential diagnostic and prognostic implications of cfDNA, its role in response assessment and in detection of disease relapse.\n",
      "The first reports on promyelocytic leukaemia came from Norway and France in 1957. Little by little, acute promyelocytic leukaemia acquired its rightful place in nosology as a hyperacute, invariable and rapidly fatal disease. In 1973, a high frequency of complete remissions induced by strong doses of daunorubicin and an acceptable frequency of true recovery, was demonstrated. After these preliminary events, the history of promyelocytic leukaemia was that of an important discovery: the first remissions of human acute leukaemia were obtained by cell differentiation, as all-trans retinoic acid induces complete remission of acute promyelocytic leukaemia in nearly all cases. The consequences of the discovery are discussed. For the long or middle term, we can hope for improved understanding of the action of retinoic acid, and possibly the preparation of new compounds with longer efficiency.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Concern about the risk of leukaemia in children living near nuclear power plants (NPPs) persists. Previous British analyses have been area based and consequently thought to be less effective than case-control studies. METHODS: Cases of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (LNHL) born and diagnosed in Great Britain between 1962 and 2007, with matched cancer-free controls, were analysed by logistic regression to estimate the risk of residential proximity at birth and diagnosis to the nearest NPP, adjusting for relevant variables. RESULTS: For 9821 children with LNHL under the age of 5 years, the estimated extra risk associated with residential proximity to an NPP at birth was negative-interpolated Odds Ratio (OR) at 5 km was 0.86 (0.49-1.52). The comparison of 10 618 children with LNHL under five with 16 760 similarly aged children with other cancers also gave a negative estimate of the extra risk of residential proximity at diagnosis-interpolated OR at 5 km was 0.86 (0.62-1.18). CONCLUSION: Our results show little evidence of an increase in risk of LNHL to children aged under 5 years from living in the vicinity of an NPP. Risk estimates are incompatible with comparable ones published in a recent German case-control study.\n",
      "We have used genomic probes which specifically recognize DNA rearrangements of the RAR-alpha locus on chromosome 17q21 in patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) subtypes. Molecular data were examined in comparison with morphological and immunophenotypic characterization at diagnosis in 20 hypergranular FAB M3 cases, five microgranular APL (M3v), 51 non-M3 AML and 12 myeloid CML blast crises. Rearrangements of the RAR-alpha locus were only detected in 23/25 APL cases and in none of the other FAB subtypes analysed. Surface marker characterization showed a consistent immunophenotypic profile--HLADR negative, CD9 and CD13/33 positive--in all M3 and M3v cases. Neither HLADR negativity nor CD9 positivity were associated with RAR-alpha rearrangements in non M3 AML. Our data indicate that RAR-alpha gene rearrangements are relevant diagnostic features of both M3 and M3v, and may prove useful molecular marker for follow-up analysis in APL patients.\n",
      "In this multi-centre study, we analysed the prognostic impact of mutations in 19 genes associated with myeloid malignancies in 258 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia patients (aged 19-70 years) undergoing intensive therapy. We identified five patient groups with different prognostic risks and different benefits from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) within the intermediate cytogenetic risk group patients (n = 184). The most adverse prognosis was observed in patients with DNMT3A and FLT3-ITD co-mutation, whose survival could be significantly improved with alloHSCT. In contrast, the most favourable prognosis without any further benefit from alloHSCT was identified in patients with mutations in NPM1 or CEBPA, after exclusion of the unfavourable prognostic groups defined by mutations in DNMT3A, RUNX1 or genes from chromatin/spliceosome group. An additional analysis of 113 diagnosis-remission paired samples revealed that persistence of non-DNMT3A mutations (above 2% VAF) represented a further negative prognostic factor. The proposed model offers a possible molecular stratification and treatment guidance for intermediate cytogenetic risk group patients.\n",
      "Extramedullary relapse of acute myeloid leukaemia may occur in sites such as the central nervous system, testes, and skin. Presentations in the female genital tract are uncommon and usually asymptomatic. In contrast, symptomatic uterine myeloid sarcoma is very rare. Treatment of this is generally unsuccessful, but is improved when systemic therapies are used. We study a case of a uterine relapse of acute myeloid leukaemia presenting as vaginal bleeding and successfully managed by local irradiation. The mechanism of preferential infiltration of uterine tissue requires further study.\n",
      "We evaluated the long-term side-effects of allogeneic BMT performed early in the course of childhood acute leukaemia (first complete remission and interval between diagnosis and BMT not exceeding 6 months). Thirteen patients fulfilled these criteria. Conditioning regimens included TBI in eight cases. Evaluation of growth and pubertal development, ophthalmological examination, assessment of thyroid, cardiac and pulmonary functions were performed. Neuropsychological evaluation included IQ score, memory tests and cranial MRI. Median follow-up after BMT was 5 years (range 2-10 years). Growth was normal in seven patients. Six patients experienced a decrease in SD score for height (range -0.1 to -1.9). Four children were evaluable for puberty: pubertal development was normal in three children and delayed in one case. Thyroid and left ventricular function were normal in all cases. Three patients had mild abnormalities of pulmonary function. In two patients cataracts were noted 7 and 10 years after fTBI. Mean full-scale IQ score was 102. Memory tests, performed in 12 cases, were in the normal range for 11 patients. In our study, frequency and severity of long-term side-effects following BMT for leukemia appeared lower than usually reported. A possible explanation is that children were transplanted very early in the course of their disease with neither cranial irradiation nor long exposure to chemotherapy prior to transplant.\n",
      "The clinical utility of minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is not yet defined. We analysed the prognostic impact of MRD level at complete remision after induction therapy using multiparameter flow cytometry in 306 non-APL AML patients. First, we validated the prognostic value of MRD-thresholds we have previously proposed (≥ 0.1%; ≥ 0.01-0.1%; and <0.01), with a 5-year RFS of 38%, 50% and 71%, respectively (p=0.002). Cytogenetics is the most relevant prognosis factor in AML, however intermediate risk cytogenetics represent a grey zone that require other biomarkers for risk stratification, and we show that MRD evaluation discriminate three prognostic subgroups (p=0.03). Also, MRD assessments yielded relevant information on favourable and adverse cytogenetics, since patients with favourable cytogenetics and high MRD levels have poor prognosis and patients with adverse cytogenetics but undetectable MRD overcomes the adverse prognosis. Interestingly, in patients with intermediate or high MRD levels, intensification with transplant improved the outcome as compared with chemotherapy, while the type of intensification therapy did not influenced the outcome of patients with low MRD levels. Multivariate analysis revealed age, MRD and cytogenetics as independent variables. Moreover, a scoring system, easy in clinical practice, was generated based on MRD level and cytogenetics.\n",
      "B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) is a clonal malignant disease originated in a single cell and characterized by the accumulation of blast cells that are phenotypically reminiscent of normal stages of B-cell differentiation. B-ALL origin has been a subject of continuing discussion, given the fact that human disease is diagnosed at late stages and cannot be monitored during its natural evolution from its cell of origin, although most B-ALLs probably start off with chromosomal changes in haematopoietic stem cells. However, the cells responsible for maintaining the disease appear to differ between the different types of B-ALLs and this remains an intriguing and exciting topic of research, since these cells have been posited to be responsible for resistance to conventional therapies, recurrence and dissemination. During the last years this problem has been addressed primarily by transplantation of purified subpopulations of human B-ALL cells into immunodeficient mice. The results from these different reconstitution experiments and their interpretations are compared in this review in the context of normal B-cell developmental plasticity. While the results from different research groups might appear mutually exclusive, we discuss how they could be reconciled with the biology of normal B-cells and propose research avenues for addressing these issues in the future.\n",
      "Recent studies have reported the ectopic expression of olfactory receptors (ORs) in non-olfactory tissues, however, their physiological roles were not well elucidated. ORs are expressed in and function in different types of cancers. Here, we identified that the H3K9me2 levels of several OR promoters decreased during differentiation in the HL-60, human myeloid leukaemia cell line, by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). We found that the differential OR promoters H3K9me2 levels were regulated by G9a and LSD1, resulting in the decrease of ORs transcription during HL-60 differentiation. G9a and LSD1 could regulate the expression of ORs in several non-olfactory cells via the methylation and demethylation of H3K9me2. In addition, we demonstrated that knockdown of OR significantly reduced cell proliferation. Therefore, the epigenetic regulation of ORs transcription is critical for carcinogenesis.\n",
      "We reported previously that pironetin and its derivatives were potent inhibitors of cell cycle progression at the M-phase and showed antitumour activity against a murine tumour cell line, P388 leukaemia, transplanted in mice. In this paper, we investigated the mechanism of action of pironetins in antitumour activity and cell cycle arrest at the M-phase. As reported previously for murine leukaemia P388 cells, pironetin showed antitumour activity in a dose-dependent manner in the human leukaemia cell line HL-60. Since DNA fragmentation was observed in both P388 and HL-60 cells, the antitumour activity of pironetin is thought to be due to the induction of apoptosis. Pironetin also induced the rapid phosphorylation of Bcl-2 before formation of the DNA ladder in HL-60 cells, as seen with several tubulin binders. These results suggest that the antitumour activity of pironetin is due to apoptosis caused by the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, and that pironetin targets the microtubules. Pironetin and demethylpironetin exhibited reversible disruption of the cellular microtubule network in normal rat fibroblast 3Y1 cells. However, epoxypironetin, which contains epoxide instead of the double bond of pironetin, showed only weak activity. Since the concentrations that inhibit cell cycle progression at the M-phase were the same as those for disruption of the microtubule network, it was suggested that the mitotic arrest induced by pironetin was the result of the loss of the mitotic spindle. These compounds also inhibited the microtubule-associated protein-induced and glutamate-induced tubulin assembly in vitro. Pironetin inhibited the binding of [3H]vinblastine, but not that of [3H]colchicine, to tubulin, and the Kd values revealed that the affinity of pironetin for tubulin is stronger than that of vinblastine. These results suggest that pironetins are novel antitumour agents which inhibit microtubule assembly.\n",
      "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Flow cytometry is an important tool to diagnose acute leukaemia. Attempts are being made to find the minimal number of antibodies for correctly diagnosing acute leukaemia subtypes. The present study was designed to evaluate the analysis of side scatter (SSC) versus CD45 flow dot plot to distinguish acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), with minimal immunological markers. METHODS: One hundred consecutive cases of acute leukaemia were evaluated for blast cluster on SSC versus CD45 plots. The parameters studied included visual shape, CD45 and side scatter expression, continuity with residual granulocytes/lymphocytes/monocytes and ratio of maximum width to maximum height (w/h). The final diagnosis of ALL and AML and their subtypes was made by morphology, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping. Two sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann Whitney) test and Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank tests were applied to elucidate the significance of the above ratios of blast cluster for diagnosis of ALL, AML and their subtypes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the optimal cut-offs of the w/h ratio to distinguish between ALL and AML determined. RESULTS: Of the 100 cases, 57 of ALL and 43 cases of AML were diagnosed. The median w/h ratio of blast population was 3.8 for ALL and 1 for AML (P<0.001). ROC had area under curve of 0.9772.The optimal cut-off of the w/h ratio for distinction of ALL from AML was found to be 1.6. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that if w/h ratio on SSC versus CD45 plot is less than 1.6, AML may be considered, and if it is more than 1.6, ALL may be diagnosed. Using morphometric analysis of the blast cluster on SSC versus CD45, it was possible to distinguish between ALL and AML, and their subtypes.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in survival and treatment for myeloid leukaemia in South Australia during 1977-2002, using population-based survival data plus data on survival and treatment of patients at three teaching hospitals. METHODS: Population data were analysed using relative survival methods and hospital registry data using disease-specific survival. Univariate and multivariable analyses were undertaken. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with first-line chemotherapy. RESULTS: South Australia recorded 1,572 new cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 1977-2002, together with 536 cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Of these cases, 42.6% were recorded in teaching hospital registries. The five-year survival for AML at the teaching hospitals of 14.5% was similar to the corresponding 12.0% for South Australia as a whole. The five-year survival for CML at these hospitals was higher, however, at 48.1% compared with 37.5% for all South Australian cases. Younger patients had higher survivals, both for AML and CML. An increase in survival was evident for more recently diagnosed cases for both leukaemia types, after adjusting for age. This increase in survival was accompanied by an increase over time in the proportion of patients at teaching hospitals having a primary course of chemotherapy. Cytarabine in combination with other agents was the most common induction therapy for AML. While hydroxyurea was the most common first-line treatment of CML, there were changes in clinical policies towards higher-dose treatments, plus trials of new agents and combination therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Secular gains in survival have occurred from AML and CML in association with an increased use of chemotherapy.\n",
      "The majority of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are elderly. Advancements in supportive care and regimen intensification have resulted in improvements in clinical outcomes for younger AML patients, but analogous improvements in older patients have not been realized. While outcomes are compromised by increased comorbidities and susceptibility to toxicity from therapy, it is now recognized that elderly AML represents a biologically distinct disease that is more aggressive and less responsive to therapy. Some patients tolerate and benefit from intensive remission-induction approaches, while others are best managed with less aggressive strategies. The challenge is to differentiate these groups based on host-related and biological features, in order to maximize the therapeutic benefit and minimize toxicity. As more is understood about the complicated pathogenesis and molecular basis of AML, there are more opportunities to develop and test targeted therapies. Elderly patients, with their narrow therapeutic window, are well positioned to derive a benefit from these novel agents, and therefore, despite a difficult past, there are reasons to be optimistic about the future of elderly AML.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Clonal Philadelphia (Ph)-negative cytogenetic abnormalities (CPCA) have been reported in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients treated with either interferon or tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). However, the incidences and types of these cytogenetic abnormalities after treatment vary due to the limited populations enroled. METHODS: We analysed the frequency and types of CPCA in a cohort of 607 CML patients in the chronic phase after TKI treatment. We also followed up these CPCA with a median of 31.8 months (range from 11 to 63 months) from diagnosis and investigated their effects on disease progression. RESULTS: We found 18 out of 607 CML patients had cytogenetic abnormality in the Ph-negative cells with an incidence of 3%. In total, six types of chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in these 18 patients with the majority of them aneuploidy abnormalities, especially the trisomy 8. Four of 18 patients (22.2%) were noted to have several abnormalities in the Ph-negative cells. Furthermore, follow-up studies of these CPCA showed that they could be either persistent or transient (15 vs 3 patients), and may not affect disease progression since none of them developed transformed myelodysplasia or transformed acute myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Three percent of CML patients in the chronic phase were observed to have CPCA during TKI treatment. Our results suggest that the detection of CPCA in CML may not predict disease progression.\n",
      "We analysed a large homogeneous group of 14,403 patients transplanted for early leukaemia from an HLA-identical sibling and reported to the EBMT in four time cohorts: 1980-1989 (24%), 1990-1994 (26%), 1995-1998 (30%) and 1999-2001 (20%). We focused on death from infection. End points were survival, death from relapse and transplant-related mortality (TRM), which was subdivided into death from graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (1315 patients; 25% of deaths), infection (597 patients; 11% of deaths) or 'other' causes (1875 patients; 34% of deaths). Survival increased from 52% at 5 years in the first to 62% in the third cohort (P<0.05) and TRM decreased from 36 to 26% (P<0.05) due to a reduction in death from infection (P<0.001). GvHD, 'other' causes and relapse did not improve. The relative proportions of bacteria (217 patients; 36%), viruses (183 patients; 31%), fungi (166 patients; 28%) or parasites (32 patients; 5%) as cause of infectious death (cumulative incidence of death at 5 years 1.8, 1.6, 1.4 and > or = 0.3%, respectively) and median time to death from infections (3 months (range 0-158 months)) did not change. Death from infections has been reduced significantly, but it still represents an ongoing risk after HSCT and draws attention to the time beyond the initial period of neutropenia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Therapy-related acute leukaemia (TRAL) is a concern for neurologists and patients when considering treatment with Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis (MS). The timing of this complication, risk, mortality and relationship to exposure remain uncertain. METHODS: We searched literature for publications relating to Mitoxantrone in MS, reviewed publication references and handsearched abstract lists to identify case-series reporting follow-up and complications of treatment with Mitoxantrone. We combined this with our local database of 250 cases treated since 1997. We also identified all reported individual cases of TRAL and extracted data reporting exposure (dose or mg/m(2)), timing and outcome of TRAL. RESULTS: Case-series including 5472 patients were identified; mean dose of Mitoxantrone was 74.2 mg/m(2) (range:12-120 mg/m(2)). TRAL was diagnosed in 0.30% (1 in 333). In 34 TRAL cases, sufficient data was available to inform analysis of exposure. Onset was a median of 18.5 months following Mitoxantrone treatment (range:4-60). Acute Myelocytic Leukaemia and Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia represented 46.4% each of the leukaemia subtypes. Six of 25 TRAL patients, where outcome was reported, died (24%). Over 80% of cases occurred in patients exposed to >60 mg/m(2), with a relative risk of 1.44 (CI95%:1.18-1.70) when comparing total dose >60 mg/m(2) against <60 mg/m(2) strongly suggesting a relationship between risk of TRAL and total dose.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To measure the effects of changes in treatment of acute myeloblastic leukaemia that may give better value for money. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients' notes to identify items of management costing money; prospective costing of these items. The Medical Research Council acute myeloblastic leukaemia 9 trial was used to identify the amount and distribution of these costs when either one or two courses of induction treatment were required to obtain complete remission. These findings were then extrapolated to four published international controlled trials using similarly intense treatment and in which the number of courses of treatment required for complete remission was stated, to compare British costs for treatment with idarubicin and daunorubicin, both in combination with cytarabine. SETTING: Leukaemia unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, London. SUBJECTS: Data on 10 patients receiving intensive induction treatment for acute myeloblastic leukaemia were used to identify 160 items of cost in four broad groups: general (including accommodation), diagnostic, supportive treatment, and cytotoxic chemotherapy. One newly treated patient was prospectively assessed over one month, including a time and motion study, to cost these items; then costs for 268 patients from the MRC trial receiving moderate induction chemotherapy including daunorubicin were assessed, and costs for treatment of 522 patients in the four international studies comparing daunorubicin with idarubicin were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost effectiveness was measured as the overall cost to obtain complete remission in untreated patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia after treatment with idarubicin or daunorubicin. RESULTS: The 160 costed items were measured for their sensitivity in varying the total cost of treatment, this being assessed within Britain in other district general and private hospitals to measure the extremes of cost of these items. Overall, idarubicin, although more expensive, showed a substantial saving (1477 pounds per patient) in total hospital costs, more than offsetting the increased cost (607 pounds) of the new treatment, an overall savings of 870 pounds per patient (5%). CONCLUSION: Approaches modelling cost effectiveness may be an essential part of planning new programmes of treatment in the future. This method can be used to estimate the cost effectiveness of the treatments in different environments and countries where costs may vary widely.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Hodgkin lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and acute and other leukaemias constitute about 7% of the overall cancer incidence and 8% of cancer mortality in the Nordic countries. The aim of this study is to describe and interpret the trends in relative survival and excess mortality in the five Nordic populations among these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the NORDCAN database 1964-2003, we estimated age-standardised incidence and mortality rates, 5-year relative survival, and excess mortality rates for varying follow-up periods, and age-specific 5-year relative survival by country, sex, and 5-year diagnostic period. RESULTS: Taking into account classification and registration problems in the earlier periods, the patterns of incidence, mortality, and survival are fairly similar between the countries within each cancer form studied. High 5-year relative survival ratios of over 80% were seen in the most recent period 1999-2003 for Hodgkin lymphoma, between 50 and 60% for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 38-49% for acute leukaemia and 60-73% for other leukaemia. The variations were between 28 and 41% for multiple myeloma. Danish patients diagnosed with these malignancies tend to fare slightly worse than their Nordic neighbours, with excess mortality rates marginally higher one to three months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although the recent trends and absolute levels of incidence, mortality and survival for the lympho-haematopoietic malignancies are similar, the consistently lower survival of Danish patients--irrespective of type of malignancy--points to an impact of co-morbidity related lifestyle factors, which may negatively affect the chemotherapy and radiation offered as standard treatments for these diseases.\n",
      "Childhood Hodgkin disease has a high cure rate but second cancers are common, related to treatment and perhaps genetic predisposition. The glycophorin A (GPA) mutation assay measures the frequency of NO and NN mutant erythrocytes of MN blood-group heterozygous individuals. Mutant frequencies in Hodgkin disease patients were compared with controls. No significant difference from controls was found pretreatment or in patients treated with radiotherapy only. Patients who received chemotherapy had a significantly increased frequency (total mutation frequency per 10(6) cells: 31 vs 11, p < 0.001), which may be relevant to their known increased risk of secondary leukaemia.\n",
      "Monosomy 7 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality was detected in five of 310 consecutive adult patients with acute leukaemia who were characterized by morphological, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic analyses. Morphologically, blast cells were myelomonocytic (FAB M4) in three and lymphoid (FAB L2) in two patients. By immunophenotyping, two M4 patients expressed terminal transferase (TdT) in 15-90% of myelomonoblasts (patients 3 and 1, respectively), and in the third M4 patient (no. 2), a 10% TdT+ component was present distinct from the bulk of myelomonoblasts. In one L2 patient (no. 4), the blast cells had an undifferentiated phenotype only expressing TdT and HLA-DR but lacking specific lymphoid and myeloid antigens, and patient 5 was typed as CD10+ ALL. Two patients had developed leukaemia following radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy for multiple myeloma or breast cancer. In two patients, induction chemotherapy induced a lineage switch in the immunophenotype without change in karyotype. These observations support the concept that monosomy 7 leukaemia results from the transformation of a multipotential stem cell.\n",
      "Viruses of the retrovirus and herpesvirus families are aetiological agents of human leukaemias and lymphomas. The human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 causes adult T-cell leukaemia and the Epstein-Barr virus is associated with Burkitt lymphoma, lymphomas in immunosuppressed people, and Hodgkin lymphoma. The discovery of human herpesvirus type 8 has led to the identification of a rare and unusual group of virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases. Individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus are at greatly increased risk of developing lymphoma but here the mechanism of lymphomagenesis is indirect. Recent data suggest that hepatitis C virus infection is also associated with an increased incidence of lymphoma, whereas data relating to SV40 remain controversial.\n",
      "There is much uncertainty about cancer risks at the high radiation doses used in radiotherapy (RT). It has generally been assumed that cancer induction decreases rapidly at high doses due to cell killing. However, this is not seen in all RT groups, and a model recently developed by Sachs and Brenner [2005. Solid tumor risks after high doses of ionizing radiation. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 102, 13040-13045] proposed a mechanism for repopulation of cells after radiation exposure that explained why this might happen, at least for solid tumours. In this paper, this model is generalized to allow for heterogeneity in the dose received, and various alternate patterns of repopulation are also considered. The model is fitted to the Japanese atomic bomb survivor leukaemia incidence data, and data for various therapeutically irradiated groups. Two sets of parameters from these model fits are used to assess the sensitivity of model predictions. It is shown that in general allowing for heterogeneity in dose distribution and haematopoietic stem cell migration results in lower risks than the same average dose administered uniformly and without such migration, although this does not hold in the limiting case of complete stem cell repopulation between radiation dose fractions. We also investigate the difference made by assuming a compartmental repopulation signal, and a global repopulation signal. In general we show that in the absence of stochastic extinction, compartmental repopulation always predicts a larger number of mutated cells than global repopulation. However, in certain dose regimes stochastic extinction cannot be ignored, and in these cases the numbers of mutated cells predicted with global repopulation can exceed that for compartmental repopulation. In general, mutant cell numbers are highly overdispersed, with variance much greater than the mean.\n",
      "In this paper we present our results from a study designed in order to establish and standardize a diagnostic algorithm for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in the Republic of Macedonia. A total of 146 consecutive adult patients (>15 years) were enrolled in the study. First, we determined the correct lineage assignment of the blast cells and evaluated the incidence of the favourable PML/RARα, AML1/ETO, CBFβ/MYH11 genetic markers among the AML cases. Additionally, the obtained results were correlated with patients' age, comorbidities, and performance status, and each single AML patient was stratified to effective treatment strategy. Our results showed that morphology and cytochemistry established a lineage in 132 (89.1%) of the patients, but not in 16 cases that presented as acute leukaemia, of which 7 were assigned as myeloid, and in two a non-haematopoietic malignancy was indicated with immunophenotyping. Mulitparameter flow cytometry immunophenotyping also changed the assigned lineage based on morphology and cytochemistry in 5 (3.3%) of the patients from lymphoid to myeloid and improved diagnosis in 21 (14.1%) cases. By using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) essay 28 (23.1%) patients were classified in the prognostically favourable AML genetic group; 8 patients expressed the fusion transcript PML/RARα AML1/ETO and 15 CBFβ/MYH11. Moreover, analyses of the age, performance status and comorbidities further strtified an additional 12.5% of the patients to a different risk-adapted therapy. The applied minimal screening-analysis-based diagnostic algorithm enabled improved and more precise diagnosis and clinical stratification in 37.2 % of AML patients from our study group.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite unprecedented challenges during the preceding year, there have been a wide range of significant advances in the field of chronic myeloid leukaemia. In this review article we highlight papers reporting on some of the most important developments over the last year, both with regards to the clinical management of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, as well as studies that help to increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. We have performed a PubMed search to identify important papers and abstracts listed over the last year and have included additional papers published prior to this, where relevant, to provide context. RECENT FINDINGS: We comment on novel biomarkers for treatment free remission as well as recent results from second generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) discontinuation studies. We discuss new techniques that are being used to assess TKI resistance as well as reviewing novel and emerging approaches to the management of resistant patients, including the use of combination therapies. SUMMARY: This review highlights some of the most important research to have been reported over the last year in the field of chronic myeloid leukaemia, encompassing emerging diagnostic techniques, biomarkers and novel therapeutic options.\n",
      "Modern molecular technology makes it possible to detect minimal residual acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) when the marrow remains in complete remission (CR). Thus, an important question, and the first to be discussed, is whether patients should be treated at molecular relapse, rather than only at haematological relapse. The second question to be addressed is when the various options for treatment of relapsed APL-i.e. all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracyclines, arsenic trioxide (ATO), gemtuzumab ozogamycin (GO, 'mylotarg'), and allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant-should be used. We suggest that patients with relapsed APL have different prognoses and that, accordingly, they should not all be treated identically. We note the significance of extramedullary relapse. We conclude with a summary of treatment recommendations and a discussion of new therapies that might be useful in the future.\n",
      "In haematological cancers, malignant cells circulate in the blood and lymphatic system. This may make leukaemic cells easier to target by immunotherapy than in other types of cancer. Various immunotherapy strategies have been trialled in several leukaemias including chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and in general, these have been aimed at targeting tumour-associated antigens (TAA). There are numerous TAA expressed by CML patients including WT1, proteinase 3, BCR-ABL and HAGE amongst others. The immunogenicity of the CML-specific tumour antigen, BCR-ABL, has been the subject of much debate and its role in the development of the disease and its unique sequence spanning the breakpoint region make it an ideal target for immunotherapy. However, there are a limited number of immunogenic epitopes across the junctional region, which are restricted to only a few HLA types, namely A2, A3 and B7 (Clark et al. in Blood 98:2887-2893, 2001). The second CML-associated antigen is the helicase antigen HAGE, a cancer-testis antigen found to be over-expressed in more than 50% of myeloid leukaemias (Adams et al. in Leukaemia 16:2238-2242, 2002). Very little is known about the function of this antigen and its significance to CML. However, its membership of the DEAD-box family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases and the involvement of other members of this family in tumour cell proliferation (Eberle et al. in Br J Cancer 86:1957-1962, 2002; Yang et al. in Cell Signal 17:1495-504, 2005) suggest a crucial role in the RNA metabolism of tumour cells. For these reasons, HAGE also seems to be a good target for immunotherapy as it would be applicable for the majority of patients with CML. This review aims to discuss the potential of immunotherapy for the treatment of leukaemia, in particular CML, and the prospect of targeting three CML associated antigens: BCR, ABL and HAGE. During his career, Prof. Tony Dodi made a significant contribution in this area of leukaemia research, confirming the identity of immunogenic HLA-A3 and B7-restricted peptides as targets for CTL. Published, as a highlighted paper in Clark et al. (Blood 98:2887-2893, 2001), this study demonstrated the expression of MHC-peptide complexes on the surface of CML cells and the presence of tetramer-positive CTL activity in CML patients positive for these two HLA alleles. His drive and dedication for research excellence will be remembered by all who knew and worked with him.\n",
      "Treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has improved considerably in recent years. A contributing factor has been the improved stratification for treatment according to a number of factors, including genetic determinants of outcome. Here we review the current diagnostic criteria of genetic abnormalities in precursor B-ALL (BCP-ALL), including the relevant technical approaches and the application of the most appropriate methods for the detection of each abnormality. The abnormalities with the most significant impact for treatment and management of BCP-ALL are t(9;22)(q34;q11)/BCR-ABL1, t(4;11)(q21;q23)/MLL-AFF1 and near-haploidy/low hypodiploidy for high risk stratification and, to a lesser extent, t(12;21)(p13;q22)/ETV6-RUNX1 and high hyperdiploidy for good risk management. Apart from the numerical abnormalities, these can be routinely tested for by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, providing a basic yet informative screen. However, cytogenetics, particularly fluorescence in situ hybridization may provide reliable alternative detection methods dependent upon the preferred technical approach within each protocol.\n",
      "The anti-tumoral activity of taxol encapsulated either in liposomes or in nanocapsules was compared with that of free taxol, using the P388 and L1210 leukaemia test systems. The in vitro inhibition of cell growth was measured after 48 h and 96 h exposure to various concentrations of taxol. With P388 cells, the inhibitory activities of the three forms of the drug were similar. With the L1210 cells, however, the concentrations required for a 50 per cent inhibition of cell growth (IC50) after 48 h exposure to the drug were greater for nanocapsules than for liposomes or free taxol, the values being 0.060, 0.043 and 0.035 micrograms ml-1, respectively. However, a greater efficiency of nanocapsules was observed after 96 h exposure. Using cytomorphometric analysis, no difference was found between L1210 cells treated either with free or encapsulated taxol. In vivo, mice bearing P388 leukaemia, and treated either with taxol solubilized with 5 per cent DMSO + 5 per cent cremophor in saline solution, or with taxol encapsulated in liposomes (IP daily dose of 12.5 mg Kg-1 body weight x 4 days) showed ILS values of 65.8% and 67.9% respectively. Nanocapsules proved to be toxic, apparently due to their composition: this problem is currently under investigation.\n",
      "Eosinophilic pneumonia in association with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is very rare. A teenage boy is described with eosinophilic pneumonia which preceded by several months the onset of ALL. Prior to establishment of the diagnosis he had been treated with corticosteroids with a transient response only. This delayed his final diagnosis until there were haematologic features of leukaemia. The leukaemic blasts were cALLA (CD10) positive and had a normal chromosome number with no translocations on banding studies. The pneumonia remitted rapidly when his leukaemia responded to chemotherapy.\n",
      "The inv(8)(p11q13) chromosomal abnormality, described in acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), fuses the histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) MYST3 (MOZ) gene with another HAT gene, NCOA2 (TIF2). We generated a transgenic zebrafish in which the MYST3/NCOA2 fusion gene was expressed under control of the spi1 promoter. An AML developed in 2 of 180 MYST3/NCOA2-EGFP-expressing embryos, 14 and 26 months after injection of the fusion gene in a one-cell embryo, respectively. This leukaemia was characterised by an extensive invasion of kidneys by myeloid blast cells. This model, which is the first zebrafish model of AML, demonstrates the oncogenic potency of MYST3/NCOA2 fusion gene.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate anti-leukaemic potential of coronopilin, a sesquiterpene lactone from Ambrosia arborescens, and to characterize mechanism(s) underlying its activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on Jurkat and U937, two leukaemia-derived cell lines. Apoptosis and impairment of cell cycle progression were evaluated by flow cytometry and by microscopic analysis. Changes in protein expression and activation were evaluated by western blot analysis. Coronopilin-tubulin covalent adducts were demonstrated by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Coronopilin inhibited (IC(50) ≤ 20 μm) leukaemia cell population growth, but displayed poor cytotoxicity to normal white blood cells. On Jurkat cells, coronopilin exerted cell population growth inhibition activity, mainly by triggering caspase-dependent apoptosis. Conversely, in U937 cells, coronopilin primary response was a robust arrest in G(2) /M. Marked increase in mitotic index and presence of activated cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex, phosphorylated histone H3 at Ser10, and hyperpolymerized tubulin indicated that cells accumulated in mitosis. Prolonged mitotic arrest ultimately resulted in U937 mitotic catastrophe, and dying cells exhibited the features of non-caspase-dependent death. CONCLUSIONS:   This study demonstrated that coronopilin efficiently inhibited leukaemia cell population growth by triggering cell type-specific responses. Moreover, coronopilin-mediated cell population expansion inhibition was specific to neoplastic cells, as normal white blood cell viability was not significantly affected. Thus, coronopilin may represent an interesting new chemical scaffold upon which to develop new anti-leukaemic agents.\n",
      "The underestimation of WBC by the Ortho ELT800/WS cell analyser in some cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia has been investigated. Incorrect WBC was obtained on 44% of samples. WBC, smear cell count, lymphocyte cell volume, stage of disease and chemotherapy were studied in both discrepant and non-discrepant cases. The evidence suggested that low lymphocyte cell volume was the major cause of the anomaly. The relationship of small lymphocyte cell volume to increased cell density is also discussed.\n",
      "The development of cancer vaccines directed against myeloid leukaemias has been a research area of intense interest in the past decade. Both human studies in vitro and mouse models in vivo have demonstrated that leukaemia-associated antigens (LAAs), such as the fusion protein BCR-ABL, Wilms' tumour protein and proteinase 3, may serve as effective targets for cellular immunotherapy. Peptide-based vaccines are able to induce cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses that kill leukaemia cells. Based on these results, pilot clinical trials have been initiated in chronic and acute myeloid leukaemia and other haematological malignancies, which include vaccination of patients with synthetic peptides derived from these LAAs. Results from these trials show that peptide vaccines are able to induce immune responses that are sometimes associated with clinical benefit. These early clinical results are promising and provide valuable information for future improvement of the vaccines. This chapter will focus mainly on discussing the preclinical studies of peptide vaccines in human systems, the results from clinical trials and the future prospects for vaccine therapy for myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "The blood-related cancer leukaemias were the first diseases where human cancer stem cells, or leukaemic stem cells (LSC), were isolated. The haematopoietic system is one of the best tissues for investigating cancer stem cells, because the developmental hierarchy of normal blood formation is well defined. Leukaemias can now be viewed as aberrant haematopoietic processes initiated by rare LSC that have maintained or reacquired the capacity for indefinite proliferation through accumulated mutations and/or epigenetic changes. Yet, despite their critical importance, much remains to be learned about the developmental origin of LSC and the mechanisms responsible for their emergence in the course of the disease. This report will review our current knowledge on normal and LSC development and examine the impact of these discoveries may have clinically and in our understanding of the leukaemogenic process.\n",
      "Gene PRAME was found to encode an antigen recognized on a human melanoma cell line by an autologous cytolytic T-lymphocyte clone. This gene is expressed at a high level in a very large fraction of tumours, such as melanomas, non-small-cell lung carcinomas, sarcomas, head and neck tumours and renal carcinomas. It is therefore a candidate for tumour immunotherapy even though some low expression is found in certain normal tissues. We tested by RT-PCR the expression of PRAME on more than 250 bone marrow or blood samples from patients with a haematological malignancy. Approximately 25% of the acute leukaemia samples were positive. Remarkably, all acute myeloblastic leukaemias that carried the chromosomal translocation t(8;21), which fuses the genes AML1 and ETO, expressed PRAME at a high level.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To review the oral care regimens for children with acute leukaemia, and to present an easy-to-follow oral care protocol for those affected children. DATA SOURCES: Medline and non-Medline search of the literature; local data; and personal experience. STUDY SELECTION: Articles containing supportive scientific evidence were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and reviewed independently by the authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: Cancer is an uncommon disease in children, yet it is second only to accidents as a cause of death for children in many countries. Acute leukaemia is the most common type of malignancy encountered in children. The disease and its treatment can directly or indirectly affect the child oral health and dental development. Any existing lesions that might have normally been dormant can also flare up and become life-threatening once the child is immunosuppressed. Proper oral care before, during, and after cancer therapy has been found to be effective in preventing and controlling such oral complications. CONCLUSION: Proper oral care for children with leukaemia is critical. Long-term follow-up of these children is also necessary to monitor their dental and orofacial growth.\n",
      "Cyclosporine was used to induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) receiving autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Nine consecutive patients with AML in remission were conditioned with either busulphan and cyclophosphamide or melphalan and total body irradiation (TBI) followed by ABMT. Cyclosporine, 1 mg/kg daily from days 1-28 was administered intravenously in four patients and orally in five. Acute GVHD of the skin, confirmed by histological and immunological criteria occurred in three patients, 4-28 days after ABMT and lasted 8-18 days. Incidence and severity of GVHD were independent of cyclosporine levels. Three patients subsequently relapsed, of whom two had had evidence of GVHD. All of these patients were in second remission at time of graft, and therefore poor risk. The potential of cyclosporine to induce GVHD in the AML autograft setting is demonstrated, although the significance of this observation in terms of an antileukaemia effect needs clarification.\n",
      "Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is the major epigenetic modification of mammalian genomes, critical for regulating chromatin structure and gene activity. The mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) CXXC domain selectively binds nonmethyl-CpG DNA, and is required for transformation by MLL fusion proteins that commonly arise from recurrent chromosomal translocations in infant and secondary treatment-related acute leukaemias. To elucidate the molecular basis of nonmethyl-CpG DNA recognition, we determined the structure of the human MLL CXXC domain by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The CXXC domain has a novel fold in which two zinc ions are each coordinated tetrahedrally by four conserved cysteine ligands provided by two CGXCXXC motifs and two distal cysteine residues. We have identified the CXXC domain DNA binding interface by means of chemical shift perturbation analysis, cross-saturation transfer and site-directed mutagenesis. In particular, we have shown that residues in an extended surface loop are in close contact with the DNA. These data provide a template for the design of specifically targeted therapeutics for poor prognosis MLL-associated leukaemias.\n",
      "Elderly patients (> 60 years) with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) have significantly inferior remission rates (around 50%) and median survival times (5-6 months) despite intensive therapy, compared with younger AML patients. This observation emanating from several large clinical studies has made treatment of elderly AML patients a highly controversial issue, with clinicians largely polarizing to one extreme viewpoint or the other. This article summarises the current understanding of the biology and the resultant justification for the assertion that AML in elderly patients is a distinct clinical entity; provides a useful list of prognostic factors to enable a rational therapeutic decision in individual patients; reviews the encouraging results with low-dose combination chemotherapy in small, non-randomized studies from four different centres; and draws attention to the possible significance of drug scheduling and pharmacokinetics in the treatment of elderly patients.\n",
      "At the end of the sixties and to beginning of the seventies years the total body irradiation (TBI) was introduced in the concept of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The aim is the destruction of leukaemic or normal stem cells surviving the chemotherapy or the overcoming of the immunological defense. From March 1980 to January 1987 we have treated 84 patients with single exposure of 8.5 to 10.5 Gy midline dose for body and lung in cases of leukaemia and of 6 to 7 Gy for patients with aplastic anaemia. We used a dose rate of about 5.5 cGy/min delivered by a linear accelerator. The results were comparable with other centres but a further indicator for the effectiveness of a irradiation technique is also the idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis (IIP). Our incidence of IIP was 10.7 per cent and the mortality was 2.4 per cent. Additional we have had 8.3 per cent interstitial pneumonitis (IP) caused by an infection. All patients with a combination of IP and GVHD had a fatal prognosis. In present time a tendency is to see to fractionation techniques in total body irradiation for decreasing of the pneumonitis rate, the reduction of severe acute and delayed side effects, for a better homogenisation of the dose in the whole body and for using of synchronizing effects on the stem cells.\n",
      "The expression and structure of the cdc2 gene, one of the master regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle, were investigated in fresh leukaemic cells from 51 cases of various types of leukaemia. Cdc2 mRNA transcripts were detectable in approximately 40% (21/51) of cases by Northern blotting. Over-expression of cdc2 mRNA as compared to normal bone marrow cells was noted in 10/21 cases with detectable cdc2 mRNA transcripts. Amplification of the cdc2 gene was found in three cases. Cdc2 mRNA was over-expressed in these three cases, suggesting that gene amplification is a direct cause of mRNA over-expression in a subset of cases. Cell proliferative capacity was well correlated with the amount of cdc2 mRNA transcripts, i.e. 3H-thymidine incorporation was highest in cases with cdc2 mRNA over-expression and was significantly higher in cdc2-positive cases than in cdc2-negative cases. These results suggest that over-expression of CDC2, which is due to the gene amplification in some cases, might play a role in altered growth of leukaemic cells.\n",
      "Cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 12/12 chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) patients revealed a proliferative response stimulated by their untreated leukaemic cells. Specific recognition of tumour cells by patients' normal lymphocytes was suggested by the finding that cells of siblings genotypically identical for human leukocyte antigen caused no stimulation. Lymphocytes thus stimulated by tumour cells from one of these patients were cloned by limiting dilution and tested for antileukaemic effects in cytotoxicity and proliferation assays. Cytotoxic lines were isolated that killed autologous CML targets but only a limited number of allogeneic fresh leukaemias or cell lines. These results show that anti-leukaemia effectors can be isolated from chronic-phase CML patients and suggest their potential application in adoptive immunotherapy.\n",
      "Ethnic differences in haematologic malignancies remain poorly elucidated, hence research in this area is important. This was a retrospective study into potential ethnic disparity in the presentation and outcomes of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) between New Zealand (NZ) Polynesian and European patients. Data were analysed for patients treated at Auckland City Hospital (ACH; n = 55) and recorded in the New Zealand Cancer Registry (NZCR; n = 173), both for the period 2000-2017. We found that Polynesian patients treated at ACH presented at a younger age than European (P = 0.005), showed higher blast counts (P = 0.033), and a marginally higher prothrombin ratio (P = 0.02). Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was started faster in Polynesian patients than European (P = 0.021), suggesting Polynesians were sicker at presentation but were managed accordingly. There were no differences in bleeding events, transfusion requirements and early deaths during the first month of treatment. Long-term survival was also similar. Data extracted from the NZCR confirmed NZ Polynesian patients with APL were younger than European (P < 0.001), but long-term survival was similar (P = 0.920). In summary, this study indicates a discrepancy in the presentation and severity of APL between NZ Polynesian and European patients but treatment initiation was rapid with no difference in outcomes. The distinctive features of APL in NZ Polynesians raise the possibility of a predisposing genetic factor or a different risk factor profile, elucidation of which is important for all patients with APL.\n",
      "In response to professional and public concern about health consequences, in particular cancer risk, from previous and current levels of ionising radiation in the Irish Sea, a study of incidence and mortality from acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) and other lymphoid malignancies in children was undertaken. Overall rates were similar to those found in other western populations and distribution of high rates was quite random over the country as a whole. There was a small but significant excess in incidence of ALL for the years 1974-76 in a narrow three mile wide strip along the east coast. It is not possible in the context of this study to postulate aetiological factors which might explain this finding.\n",
      "Recent research into mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy in acute leukaemia has been focused on various protective mechanisms at the cellular level, such as drug uptake, efflux, metabolism and DNA repair mechanisms, while therapeutic failures due to other potentially important causes have received relatively little attention. Here we describe a simple model to account for three major determinants of tumour response in acute leukaemia: cellular drug sensitivity, leukaemic cell regrowth potential and systemic drug exposure. Possible ways of measuring these parameters are discussed. It is suggested that laboratory estimation of these parameters may provide valuable information on clinical drug resistance and may help to design more adequate treatment strategies for the individual patient.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Despite years of interest in the anti-cancerous effects of cardiac glycosides (CGs), and numerous studies in vitro and in animals, it has not yet been possible to utilize this potential clinically. Reports have demonstrated promising in vitro effects on different targets as well as a possible therapeutic index/selectivity in vitro and in experimental animals. Recently, however, general inhibition of protein synthesis was suggested as the main mechanism of the anti-cancerous effects of CGs. In addition, evidence of species differences of a magnitude sufficient to explain the results of many studies called for reconsideration of earlier results. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this report we identified primary B-precursor and T-ALL cells as being particularly susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of CGs. Digitoxin appeared most potent and IC(50) values for several patient samples were at concentrations that may be achieved in the clinic. Significant protein synthesis inhibition at concentrations corresponding to IC(50) was demonstrated in colorectal tumour cell lines moderately resistant to the cytotoxic effects of digoxin and digitoxin, but not in highly sensitive leukaemia cell lines. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that further investigation regarding CGs may be focused on diagnoses like T- and B-precursor ALL.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Patients with hyperleukocytic leukaemia were graded according to the severity of symptoms possibly caused by leukostasis to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and to test the relative contribution of blast type and count of blasts and promyelocytes in the development of leukostasis syndrome. METHODS: Ninety-five patients (59 male, 36 female, median age 52 yr) with hyperleukocytic leukaemia [leukocytes above 50 x 10(9)/L, 48 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 31 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), 13 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), three chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML)] were grouped according to the presence or absence and severity of neurologic, pulmonary and other symptoms into four categories (no, possible, probable and highly probable leukostasis syndrome). Age, white blood count (WBC), haemoglobin, blast count and total of blasts plus promyelocytes of these groups were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Patients with myeloid leukaemia (AML M1/M2, CML) which scored as highly probable leukostasis showed significantly higher WBC (P = 0.011), lower haemoglobin (P = 0.004), higher peripheral blast counts (P = 0.004) and higher total of peripheral blasts plus promyelocytes (P < 0.001) compared with the lower probability groups. In leukaemia involving the monocytic lineage (AML M4/M5, CMML) no significant differences were found in any of these factors between patients with highly probable leukostasis and the other patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a four-stage clinical grading scale is a valuable tool for analysing hyperleukocytic patient populations and evaluate the effectiveness of therapy more precisely. We further demonstrate that the mechanisms of leukostasis are different in myeloid leukaemia as compared with leukaemia with involvement of the monocytic lineage.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Ofuji disease is an eosinophilic dermatosis mostly affecting male subjects. It is characterized by the appearance of follicular papulopustolosis, at times on an erythematous base, which tend to form an annular configuration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two cases are described: the first is a 45-year-old man affected by acute myeloid leukaemia and Ofuji disease; the second is a 61-year-old man affected by chronic lymphatic leukaemia and Ofuji disease. Culture tests were negative in both cases. In both patients no hypereosinophilia was found. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous presence of the two pathologies in these patients can only give rise to hypothesis. In the first case it could be attributed to interleukin (IL)-5, which causes both eosinophilic hyperproduction and blast differentiation. In the second case the hypersecretion of intercellular adhesion molecule type 1 (ICAM-1) in Ofuji disease could be attributed to a modified transcriptional gene belonging to the class of immunoglobulin codifying genes located on the altered chromosomes in a certain percentage of leukaemic patients.\n",
      "Acute leukaemias occur as the result of clonal expansion subsequent to transformation and arrest at a normal differentiation stage of haematopoietic precursors, which commit to a single lineage, such as myeloid or B-lymphoid or T-lymphoid cells. Biphenotypic acute leukaemia (BAL) constitutes a biologically different group of leukaemia arising from a precursor stem cell and co-expressing more than one lineage specific marker. The present report describes a child with unusual co-occurrence of biphenotypic (B-precursor cell and Myeloid) acute leukaemia, haemoglobin E trait and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6-PD) deficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this constellation of haematological conditions in a single child has never been described before.\n",
      "Rearrangements involving chromosome band 11q23 are very common in acute leukaemia, both lymphoblastic and myeloid (monoblastic), and are less common in lymphoma. Although several different genes have been cloned from translocation breakpoints, the great majority of translocations involve the MLL (myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia) gene. The MLL gene has several different names, ALL1, Htrx, HRX; the central part of the gene codes for multiple zinc fingers which show strong homology to the Drosophila trithorax gene. MLL is involved in four common translocations as well as in 25 uncommon or rare translocations, insertions and deletions. The translocation breakpoints occur within an 8.3 kb region which can be detected with a 0.74 kb cDNA probe. Twenty-five percent of patients have a deletion 3' of the breakpoint which includes the zinc finger region. Patients who previously received drugs that inhibit topoisomerase II often develop acute leukaemia with translocations involving 11q23. These translocations break MLL in the same 8.3 kb region. In the three breakpoints cloned to date, the translocation has led to a fusion gene on the derivative 11 chromosome with a chimaeric transcript, consisting of 5' MLL and the 3' segment of the other gene. Although transcripts were also cloned from the other derivative chromosome, all the evidence indicates that the critical fusion gene is on the derivative 11 chromosome. The molecular dissection of these rearrangements will provide insights into the biology of MLL and into the interaction of MLL with topoisomerase II inhibitors. In addition, this research has provided DNA probes that will be important for diagnosis and for monitoring patients during the course of their disease.\n",
      "Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a strong prognostic factor in children and adolescents with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) but nearly one-quarter of patients who achieve MRD-negative status still relapse. The adverse prognostic factors among MRD-negative patients remain unknown. We analysed the AML02 study cohort to identify demographic and genetic prognostic factors. Among the presenting features, certain 11q23 abnormalities, such as t(6;11) and t(10;11), acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia without the t(1;22), and age ≥10 years were associated with inferior outcome in patients who had MRD-negative status after either remission induction I or II. By contrast, those with rearrangement of CBF genes had superior outcome. Our study identifies patient populations for whom close post-remission MRD monitoring to detect and treat emerging relapse and adjustment in treatment intensity might be indicated.\n",
      "Extensive literature has demonstrated that acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells show enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) compared with normal hematopoietic progenitors, and one hallmark of AML leukaemia blasts is myeloid differentiation blockade. However, relatively few reports have linked these processes. Recent studies have indicated that therapies that overcome differentiation arrest represent an effective treatment strategy. Here, we identified that the disruption of the mitochondrial mass and energy metabolism promotes leukaemia cellular myeloid differentiation. In this study, we showed that acute monocytic leukaemia (AML-M5) cells package mitochondria in microvesicles (MVs) when MVs shed from membranes. Additionally, during myeloid differentiation, we report for the first time that differentiated leukaemia cells release more MVs than undifferentiated leukaemia cells. Targeting the formation of MVs using a specific inhibitor (Y-27632) restrained myeloid differentiation, suggesting that the increased release level of MVs plays an important role in regulating myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, the intracellular mitochondria and ATP levels were decreased after leukaemia cells overcame the differentiation blockade. Moreover, rotenone, which is used to inhibit the respiratory chain and ATP production, had a strong effect on myeloid differentiation in monocytic leukaemia cells. Collectively, these studies uncovered the relationship between mitochondrial function and myeloid differentiation and may provide more insight into the diagnosis and treatment of AML.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: We sought to quantify plasma high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTnT) levels, their determinants, and their associations with left ventricular (LV) myocardial deformation in adult survivors of childhood acute leukaemias. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred adult survivors (57 males) of childhood acute leukaemias, aged 24.1 ± 4.2 years, and 42 age-matched controls (26 males) were studied. Plasma cTnT was determined using a highly sensitive assay. Genotyping of NAD(P)H oxidase and multidrug resistance protein polymorphisms was performed. Left ventricular function was assessed by conventional, three-dimensional, and speckle tracking echocardiography. The medians (interquartile range) of hs-cTnT in male and female survivors were 4.9 (4.2 to 7.2) ng/L and 1.0 (1.0 to 3.5) ng/L, respectively. Nineteen survivors (13 males, 6 females) (19%) had elevated hs-cTnT (>95(th) centile of controls). Compared to those without elevated hs-TnT levels, these subjects had received larger cumulative anthracycline dose and were more likely to have leukaemic relapse, stem cell transplant, and cardiac irradiation. Their LV systolic and early diastolic myocardial velocities, isovolumic acceleration, and systolic longitudinal strain rate were significantly lower. Survivors having CT/TT at CYBA rs4673 had higher hs-cTnT levels than those with CC genotype. Functionally, increased hs-cTnT levels were associated with worse LV longitudinal systolic strain and systolic and diastolic strain rates. CONCLUSIONS: Increased hs-cTnT levels occur in a significant proportion of adult survivors of childhood acute leukaemias and are associated with larger cumulative anthracycline dose received, history of leukaemic relapse, stem cell transplant, and cardiac irradiation, genetic variants in free radical metabolism, and worse LV myocardial deformation.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Genetic alterations, including microsatellite instability (MSI), are ultimate steps toward malignant process. To investigate MSI in A-bomb survivors, leukaemic cells were analysed from 13 acute myelocytic leukaemia patients with a history of radiation exposure and also in 12 de novo patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess the microsatellite changes, a fluorescent system in 10 loci (BAT40, D3S643, D5S107, IRF1, MYC, D9S171, WT1, TP53, DM, D17S855) was used. RESULTS: MSI analysis revealed a high frequency of multiple microsatellite changes in the exposed patients (84.6%) compared with non-exposed patients (8.3%). There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses clearly demonstrate that leukaemic cells from heavily exposed patients contain a number of genetic instabilities that may strongly influence the development of leukaemia among people exposed to the Hiroshima A-bomb radiation.\n",
      "The clinical, morphological, and genetic heterogeneity of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), has made it difficult to clearly assign this entity to a distinct haematological category. In 2001, the World Health Organization transferred CMML to a new category of mixed myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders, which was maintained in the last revision in 2008. Considering the rare occurrence of CMML, most pharmacotherapeutic and transplant studies combined CMML with myelodysplastic syndrome cases, but some clinical trials specifically investigated the use of demethylating agents in CMML and demonstrated stabilization of the haematological situation or even complete remission in subsets of patients. Information on the significance of other drugs is very limited. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative option for patients with CMML. Molecular studies revealed various novel genetic alterations in CMML - notably of the JAK2, TET2, CBL, IDH, or RUNX1 and RAS genes. This review summarizes the current status of pharmacotherapy and transplantation in CMML and outlines recent results of molecular research for diagnosis of this heterogeneous entity.\n",
      "Acute leukaemias in relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) respond poorly to donor leucocyte infusions (DLI) compared with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), at least in part because of faster disease kinetics. Fludarabine-containing 'non-myeloablative' chemotherapy followed by further allo SCT may offer more rapid and effective disease control. We report 14 patients with relapse after allo SCT for acute leukaemia [seven acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), five acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)] or refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t, n = 2) treated with fludarabine, high-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and granulocyte colony-simulating factor (G-CSF) with (n = 10) or without (n = 2) idarubicin (FLAG +/- Ida) or DaunoXome (FLAG-X) (n = 2) and second allo SCT from the original donor. Donors were fully human leucocyte antigen (HLA) -matched in 13 cases with a single class A mismatch in one. Actuarial overall survival was 60% and disease-free survival was 26% at 58 months. Remissions after the second SCT were longer than those after the first bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in eight of the 13 assessable patients to date. Haematopoietic recovery was rapid. Transplants were well tolerated with no treatment-related deaths. The major complication was graft-versus-host disease (GvHD, acute >/= grade II-2 cases, chronic - eight cases, two limited, six extensive) although there have been no deaths attributable to this. FLAG +/- Ida and second allo SCT is a safe and useful approach and may be more effective than DLI in the treatment of acute leukaemias relapsing after conventional allo SCT.\n",
      "Twenty patients with acute leukaemia in second or greater complete remission have undergone autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in our centre. Twelve patients had acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and eight patients had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Six of the patients treated for AML remain in CR. Of the eight patients with ALL, all have died within one year of transplantation. In the patients with AML there was no relationship between the duration of previous CR and outcome of ABMT.\n",
      "P-Glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the mdr-1 gene, is implicated in the development of chemoresistance in a variety of, mostly adult, cancers. Its role in paediatric tumours, most of which are non-epithelial in origin, has yet to be fully elucidated. A study was undertaken to investigate reactivity of two P-gp monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), JBS-1 and MRK16, recognising cytoplasmic and surface epitopes, respectively, of the P-gp molecule, in a variety of newly diagnosed and relapsed childhood cancers. P-gp was not expressed in any of 36 tumours examined (neuroblastoma 13, nephroblastoma 12, rhabdomyosarcoma 6, lymphoma 3, teratoma 1, Ewings 1), 14 of whom had chemoresistant disease. Reactivity to both MAbs was also investigated in patients with acute leukaemia. Out of 10 diagnostic acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) samples, a positive reaction with JSB-1 was observed in 1 patient who failed to remit on standard induction therapy and in 3 of 6 patients in ALL relapse, only 1 of whom showed low grade positivity with MRK16. Both MAbs reacted positively in 1 patient with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) at diagnosis who achieved remission with teniposide and cytosine arabinoside, but relapsed 7 months later and was again positive with both Mabs. JSB-1 also showed varying degrees of positivity in 4 out of 4 other patients in ANLL relapse. It would therefore appear that P-gp is unlikely to mediate chemoresistance in most solid tumours of childhood, but may well play a major role in the development of chemoresistance in acute leukaemia.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the past decade, numerous studies analysing the genome and transcriptome of large cohorts of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients have substantially improved our knowledge of the genetic landscape of these diseases with the identification of heterogeneous constellations of germline and somatic mutations with prognostic and therapeutic relevance. However, inclusion of integrated genetic data into classification schema is still far from a reality. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent insights into the prevalence, pathogenic role, clonal architecture, prognostic impact and therapeutic management of genetic alterations across the spectrum of myeloid malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent multiomic-studies, including analysis of genetic alterations at the single-cell resolution, have revealed a high heterogeneity of lesions in over 200 recurrently mutated genes affecting disease initiation, clonal evolution and clinical outcome. Artificial intelligence and specifically machine learning approaches have been applied to large cohorts of AML and MDS patients to define in an unbiased manner clinically meaningful disease patterns including, disease classification, prognostication and therapeutic vulnerability, paving the way for future use in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Integration of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and clinical data coupled to conventional and machine learning approaches will allow refined leukaemia classification and risk prognostication and will identify novel therapeutic targets for these still high-risk leukaemia subtypes.\n",
      "The retrospective analysis has concerned 323 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). The comparable patients groups were treated since 1981 according to protocols used by the Polish Acute Leukaemia Group (induction; modified TAD or Adriamycin plus Ara-C, maintenance; rotatingly changed polychemotherapy for 3 years). The prognostic value for achieving complete remission (CR) and survival of 67 pre-treatment factors (42 quantitative and 25 qualitative) was evaluated. The most important 9 parameters were scored according to the prognostic value as follows: age, proportion of blasts in bone marrow, blast count in peripheral blood, morphological subtype, percentage of granulocytes in bone marrow, proportion of blasts with CD-15 antigen, thrombocyte count, spleen/liver enlargement, protein concentration in cerebro-spinal fluid. The scoring system has been elaborated allowing selection of ANLL patients to standard risk group and a high risk group.\n",
      "A newborn infant with congenital T cell lymphoblastic leukaemia presented with hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia at birth and died on the 21st day of multi-organ failure. Biopsy and necropsy examination showed extensive atypical lymphoid infiltrates in the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Immunohistochemically, the lymphoid cells were TdT+, CD3+, CD45RO+, and CD10-, CD79a-, CD20-. Genotypic analysis using polymerase chain reaction showed T cell receptor gamma chain gene rearrangement and absence of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. This appears to be the first documented case of congenital T cell lymphoblastic leukaemia. The case had unusual histological and immunogenotypic features, disseminated early, and pursued a highly aggressive course. Consideration of the diagnosis is of paramount importance. The immunophenotypic studies and molecular characterisation of such congenital leukaemias are critical in arriving at a definite diagnosis.\n",
      "Prolymphocytic leukaemia is a rare subtype of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Three such cases are reported here along with clinical details. All these cases were seen in males above 5th decade of life. These patients showed moderate to massive splenomegaly, inconspicuous lymphadenopathy in two cases and one with minimal lymphadenopathy. Peripheral smear showed high leucocyte count with more than 55% of prolymphocytes. Bone marrow aspiration showed diffuse involvement; and in one with minimal lymphadenopathy, lymph node aspiration showed prolymphocytes. All the three patients died within a year after diagnosis.\n",
      "The distribution of mortality from 11 causes of death (lymphoid leukaemia, other leukaemia, leukaemia of all types, Hodgkin disease, other lymphomas, all lymphomas, multiple myeloma, lung cancer, other malignancies, all malignancies and all other causes) has been examined in three age groups throughout England and Wales over the period 1969-78. The reorganisation of local authority administration in 1974 meant that the smallest areas that could be examined were 400 county districts or (in some cases) approximate county districts formed by aggregating pre-1974 local authority areas. The variation in the numbers of deaths observed about the numbers expected was assessed using log-linear models to estimate the effect on the relative risk in each district associated with social class, rural status, population size, health authority region and proximity to one of 15 nuclear installations. Trends in risk with increasing proximity to an installation (as judged by the proportion of the population resident within 10 miles) were examined after adjustment for the other four variables. The results showed that in districts near to an installation there were significant excess mortalities in persons under 25 years of age from leukaemia (RR = 1.15, P = 0.01) and especially from lymphoid leukaemia (RR 1.21, P = 0.01) and from Hodgkin disease (RR 1.24, P = 0.05) and a significant deficiency of mortality from lymphoid leukaemia in persons aged 25-64 years. No significant trends were observed with an increasing proportion of the population near to the installations and the greatest excess mortality from lymphoid leukaemia in young persons was observed in the districts with the intermediate proportion of the population (10.0-65.9%) near an installation.\n",
      "One-hundred and five patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n = 61) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (n = 44) were analysed for risk factors associated with relapse. All patients received marrow from an HLA identical sibling after preparation with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and total body irradiation (TBI) 330 cGy on each of the three days prior to transplantation. There was a difference of +/- 18% between the nominal total dose of 990 cGy and the actual dose received as indicated by dosimetric recordings. While interstitial pneumonitis had minimal impact on survival (4%) there was a considerable difference in the incidence of relapses. The incidence of relapse was 55% versus 11% in patients receiving less or more than 990 cGy respectively and this had a major impact on survival (38% v. 74% at 7 years) since transplant-related mortality was comparable in the two groups. A multivariate Cox analysis indicated that a lower TBI dose (less than 990 cGy) was the most significant factor associated with relapse and the second most important factor associated with recurrence of leukaemia was the absence of chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGvHD). Actuarial relapse incidence was 62%. 28% and 18% for patients with no, limited or extensive chronic GvHD respectively. However, chronic GVHD had no significant impact on survival. Combined stratification for TBI dose and cGvHD showed that the dose effect of TBI on relapse was evident both in patients with and without cGvHD. Chronic GvHD influenced the risk of relapse only in patients receiving less than 990 cGy. These results suggest that a higher dose of TBI, within this schedule, produced long-term disease-free survival in the majority of AMLs and CMLs. Minor radiobiological side effects were experienced but a small reduction of the dose may significantly increase the risk of relapse.\n",
      "Here, we have first investigated the roles of ZNRD1 in angiogenesis of leukaemia. The leukaemia cell line K562 was transfected with the vector that included the full-length cDNA of ZNRD1, then the growth and angiogenesis of cells were detected. Up-regulation of ZNRD1 could significantly inhibit the growth of cells, reduce tumour microvessel densities and inhibit the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) production. The results of human miRNA array and real-time PCR showed that ZNRD1 could significantly up-regulate the expression of miR-214 and down-regulate the expression of miR-296. Taken together, ZNRD1 might inhibit tumour angiogenesis and could be considered as a target for leukaemia therapy.\n",
      "Cytogenetic abnormalities occur in approximately 60% of newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and are useful in the risk stratification of AML. Translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21-t(8;21)-(q22;q22.3), which carries a favourable prognosis, is found in approximately 5% to 10% of all patients with AML. Additional chromosomal abnormalities have been described in patients with AML with t(8;21), which may impact on the favourable prognosis. We report a patient who had AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22.3) and loss of the X chromosome.\n",
      "Herein we are presenting the clinical, morphological and cytochemical characteristics of five cases of acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AML-M7) seen by us over a period of five years (Jan 1996-Dec 2000). Morphological assessment revealed marked polymorphism of blast cells and platelets both in the peripheral blood and bone marrow smears in all cases. Size of the blast cells ranged from very small to very large multinucleated cells, with variable chromatin pattern and number of nucleoli. More differentiated megakaryocytic cells showing cytoplasmic blebs, protrusions and platelet budding with bizarre platelet morphology were characteristic features suggesting the diagnosis. Cytochemical stains like myeloperoxidase, sudan black and PAS were positive in 5-15% of blast cell. Coagulation studies revealed a normal coagulation profile, whereas platelet studies showed marked impairment in aggregation of platelets with ADP and adrenalin with a normal PF-3 availability.\n",
      "This study aims to systematically review prior research on the evaluation and benchmarking of automated acute leukaemia classification tasks. The review depends on three reliable search engines: ScienceDirect, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore. A research taxonomy developed for the review considers a wide perspective for automated detection and classification of acute leukaemia research and reflects the usage trends in the evaluation criteria in this field. The developed taxonomy consists of three main research directions in this domain. The taxonomy involves two phases. The first phase includes all three research directions. The second one demonstrates all the criteria used for evaluating acute leukaemia classification. The final set of studies includes 83 investigations, most of which focused on enhancing the accuracy and performance of detection and classification through proposed methods or systems. Few efforts were made to undertake the evaluation issues. According to the final set of articles, three groups of articles represented the main research directions in this domain: 56 articles highlighted the proposed methods, 22 articles involved proposals for system development and 5 papers centred on evaluation and comparison. The other taxonomy side included 16 main and sub-evaluation and benchmarking criteria. This review highlights three serious issues in the evaluation and benchmarking of multiclass classification of acute leukaemia, namely, conflicting criteria, evaluation criteria and criteria importance. It also determines the weakness of benchmarking tools. To solve these issues, multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis techniques were proposed as effective recommended solutions in the methodological aspect. This methodological aspect involves a proposed decision support system based on MCDM for evaluation and benchmarking to select suitable multiclass classification models for acute leukaemia. The said support system is examined and has three sequential phases. Phase One presents the identification procedure and process for establishing a decision matrix based on a crossover of evaluation criteria and acute leukaemia multiclass classification models. Phase Two describes the decision matrix development for the selection of acute leukaemia classification models based on the integrated Best and worst method (BWM) and VIKOR. Phase Three entails the validation of the proposed system.\n",
      "The anti-granulocyte activity of serum from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and other lymphoproliferative disorders was investigated. Granulocyte-binding IgG was measured in 34 patients with CLL, 13 patients with hairy cell leukaemia, one patient with prolymphocytic leukaemia, two patients with Sézary cell leukaemia, and seven patients with chronic T-cell lymphocytosis who had a predominance of circulating large granular lymphocytes. Anti-granulocyte activity was absent in CLL and its variants, but present in the majority of granulocytopenic patients with chronic T-cell lymphocytosis. In one of these patients, granulocytopenia was associated with complement-activating IgG granulocyte antibody. Thus, antibody-mediated granulocyte injury appears to be an unusual occurrence in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but is a frequent complication of chronic T-cell lymphocytosis.\n",
      "A patient with a typical haematological pattern of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with BCR and IgH rearrangements was brought into complete remission by treatment. A few weeks later she developed the typical peripheral and bone marrow pattern of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) with persistence of the BCR rearrangement and disappearance of the IgH rearrangement, suggesting that this case is an example of CML presenting in blast crisis without a detectable chronic phase.\n",
      "A number of fusion genes have been identified by study of acquired chromosomal translocations. Their detailed characterization has provided insights into mechanisms of leukaemogenesis and has enabled the development of molecular methods to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of residual disease after treatment. The TEL-AML1 fusion gene is associated with a cryptic t(12:21)(p12:q22) translocation, and is the commonest known genetic abnormality in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), occurring in about 25% of cases. We have used RT-PCR, followed by Southern blotting and direct sequencing, to establish the incidence of TEL-AML1 rearrangement in 131 adults with acute leukaemia (101 with ALL and 30 with chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis). Three patients were positive for TEL-AML1 transcripts. All three had common-ALL. All other patients were negative for TEL-AML1. We conclude that the TEL-AML1 fusion gene is found in adult ALL, though less commonly than in children.\n",
      "The optimal post-remission therapy for patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia remains controversial. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, autologous bone marrow transplantation, and consolidation chemotherapy are the major options. In order to evaluate their respective value the European Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation conducted a prospective registration study. Patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloblastic leukaemia were registered at the time of HLA-typing and intention to treat in case of presence or absence of an HLA-identical donor was recorded. 27/79 (34%) patients HLA-typed at diagnosis had an identical donor identified. The estimated survivals at 3 years from HLA-typing were 44% and 21% among patients with or without HLA-identical donor, respectively (P = 0.02). 22/26 (85%) patients for whom allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was intended were transplanted but only 15/47 (32%) patients for whom autologous bone marrow transplantation was intended were indeed transplanted (P < 0.001). The survival was 50%, 29% and 17% (P = 0.004) for patients treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, autologous bone marrow transplantation, or chemotherapy, respectively. 40/68 patients HLA-typed in first complete remission had an HLA-identical donor. The estimated 3-year survival among patients typed in first remission with and without HLA-identical donors was 42% and 35% (n.s.), respectively. This technique of early patient registration illustrates the problems of patient selection during the course of the disease and might be used as a complement to randomized trials when comparing bone marrow transplantation and other treatment options.\n",
      "Molecular analysis of leukaemic blasts from 9 patients with secondary myeloid leukaemia reveals rearrangements of the human trithorax gene (Htrx-1) in three patients, including one in whom abnormalities of chromosome 11 band q23 were not detected by conventional cytogenetics. All three patients had been treated with epipodophyllotoxins, whilst none of the six without rearrangements had received these agents. The patients with rearrangements also presented with different clinical features. These findings support the separation of secondary leukaemia into two classes, and correlate rearrangements of the Htrx-1 gene with a group of secondary leukaemias that follow specific cancer treatment regimens.\n",
      "Experience in the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) and accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukaemia with orally administered arsenic trioxide (ATO) in our institution since 1999 has demonstrated that bioavailability of oral ATO is comparable with intravenous administration, and similar outcomes are produced in treatment of APL. Oral administration was well tolerated, with good compliance, in patients not requiring hospitalisation for postinduction treatment and was particularly convenient for patients living considerable distances from our institution. Orally administered ATO can be considered a practicable option in management of APL.\n",
      "Acute monocytic leukaemia (French-British-American classification: AML-M5b) is characterised by a predominance of cells of the monocytic lineage on bone marrow examination. Furthermore, a discerning feature is its tendency for tissue infiltration. While gum hypertrophy and hepatosplenomegaly are common, ocular involvement is rare. Here, we present a case of a 75-year-old man referred with proptosis and monocytosis-subsequently diagnosed as AML-M5b, whose disease course was distinguished by extensive tissue invasion (ocular, pulmonary, liver, spleen). Cytogenetics and molecular tests were consistent with blastic transformation of previously undiagnosed chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, supported by the presence of long-standing, low-grade monocytosis. Notably, a BRAF V600E mutation was also detected-an oncogenic driver previously reported in de novo and therapy-related, but not chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-transformed, AML-M5b. While an initial response to cytoreductive treatment was observed, his tissue-invasive disease soon progressed with worsening pulmonary infiltrates, disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal failure, resulting in death.\n",
      "Three overlapping yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) spanning a 780 kb region of DNA around the CD3 locus on chromosome 11 have been isolated and characterised. The individual cloned regions have been mapped by in situ hybridisation to chromosome band 11q23, and a restriction enzyme map of this region has been constructed. The positions of these clones in relation to a series of leukaemia-associated chromosomal translocations has also been determined. It was concluded that, although two clones lay entirely proximal to the breakpoints examined, the third clone (13HH4) encompassed the breakpoints for the translocations t(4;11), t(6;11), and t(9;11). The t(9;11) was observed in an acute myeloid leukaemia in a patient previously treated for an unrelated malignancy. It would thus appear that the breakpoints at chromosome band 11q23 occurring in therapy-related leukaemias are in the same region as those found in adult and childhood acute leukaemias and may result from a common underlying mechanism.\n",
      "Mucormycosis is an aggressive and life-threatening opportunistic fungal infection, which predominantly affects immunocompromised patients. It typically manifests in rhinocerebral, pulmonary or disseminated forms in patients with immunosuppressive conditions. Mucormycosis limited to the oral cavity is rare, and to the best of our knowledge only seven cases have previously been reported in English literature. We present five consecutive cases of oral mucormycosis in patients with leukaemia, and provide a literature review.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/AIM: Homeobox A9 (HOXA9), a transcription factor regulating haematopoiesis and leukaemia cell proliferation, is suggested as a driver of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a synthetic HOXA9 inhibitor DB818 on AML cells in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML cell lines OCI/AML3, MV4-11, and THP-1 with gene mutations up-regulating HOXA9 expression were treated with DB818 and analysed for cell proliferation and gene expression. The effects of HOXA9 knockdown were also evaluated. RESULTS: In the three AML cell lines, DB818 suppressed growth, induced apoptosis, and down-regulated the expression of HOXA9 transcriptional target genes: MYB proto-oncogene, transcription factor (MYB), MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (MYC), and BCL2 apoptosis regulator (BCL2), while up-regulating that of Fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (FOS). HOXA9 knockdown showed similar effects, except for MYC expression, which differed between DB818-treated and HOXA9-deficient OCI/AML3 cells, suggesting an off-target effect of DB818. CONCLUSION: DB818 has potential as a novel molecular targeted drug for treating AML associated with HOXA9 overexpression.\n",
      "AIMS: To determine whether the proliferation rates of tumour cells may relate to prognosis and reflect disease activity. METHODS: Blood mononuclear cells from 155 patients with B cell (n = 120) or T cell (n = 35) chronic lymphoproliferative disorders were tested with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 by indirect immunoperoxidase or immunoalkaline phosphatase techniques. B cell diseases included chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), CLL in prolymphocytic transformation (CLL/PL), prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-PLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) in leukaemic phase. The T cell diseases comprised large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia, T-PLL, and T-NHL. RESULTS: These showed significantly higher proportions of Ki-67 positive cells in T cell (11.2%) than in B cell (2.9%) disorders (p < 0.001). The highest values were found in NHL of both B and T cell types, particularly when low grade disease transformed to high grade. The lowest percentages of Ki-67 positive cells were found in CLL (1.4%) and LGL leukaemia (1.7%); intermediate values were seen in B PLL (3.3%) and T PLL (5.8%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a positive correlation between prognosis and proliferation rates in chronic B and T cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Estimation of Ki-67 in circulating leukaemic cells could be used to determine prognosis in low grade malignancies.\n",
      "Natural killer (NK) cells express surface receptors that regulate potent effector functions, such as cytolytic activity and release of cytokines, which play a central role in inflammatory response and immunoregulation. In this paper, major advances are outlined from the original discovery of HLA-class I-specific inhibitory receptors in humans to recent, particularly successful, clinical applications in the cure of high-risk, otherwise fatal leukaemias. The central role of donor-derived \"alloreactive\" NK cells in eradicating leukaemic cells in the T-cell-depleted haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation setting became evident. Since alloreactive NK cells seem to play a key role also in preventing graft rejection and graft-vs-host disease, they may be an ideal tool to treat high-risk leukaemias in the haematopoietic stem cell transplantation setting.\n",
      "The leptin receptor is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, and is expressed in CD34 haemopoietic stem cells. We examined expression of the leptin receptor in fresh human leukaemia cells. Northern blot analysis showed the leptin receptor was expressed in leukaemic cells from patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). In CML, higher expression was observed in blast crisis than in chronic phase. The expression of leptin receptor decreased during in vitro differentiation of leukaemic blast cells. It appeared that expression of the leptin receptor was associated with immature leukaemic blast cells. Our findings may indicate the possibility that leptin has some role in leukaemia.\n",
      "Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG) is often associated with an underlying disease. PG as a paraneoplastic disease is illustrated by the presentation of four patients with malignancy of myeloproliferative origin and PG. An associated malignancy is found in approximately 7% of patients with PG, most commonly haematologic in nature and in particular leukaemia. Clinically the PG is often of the superficial bullous variant and is associated with a poor prognosis.\n",
      "This short review of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) has a distinct clinical emphasis and concentrates particularly on adult acute leukaemia and lymphoma in which the greatest amount of current clinical experience lies. In the early part of the review we discuss how escalations of dose of chemoradiotherapy might allow ablation of both marrow-derived (leukaemia) and non-marrow-derived disease (lymphoma and solid tumour) provided that haemopoiesis is reintroduced into the host in the form of autologous marrow stem cells, and how cryopreservation techniques have allowed this to proceed. Whilst discussing ABMT in acute leukaemia we describe initial results possibly suggestive of an improvement on current consolidation/maintenance chemotherapy regimens but emphasis that we are dealing only with heterogeneous registry data and not randomised controlled trials. We also suggest that there is no useful data as yet as to the value of purging autologous acute leukaemia marrow. The lymphoma data is described which may suggest a useful role of high dose therapy with ABMT in relapsed disease-timing of ABMT may need to differ profoundly in HD from NHL. Current ABMT data in lymphoma suggests that local relapse at sites of previous disease remain the major problem and emphasises the difficulties of finding satisfactory ablative regimens and timing the selection of patients at particular points in the natural history of their disease. Finally, we emphasise that although solid tumours may numerically represent the largest group of potential candidates for ABMT, the picture in this area remains essentially one of failure to be able to ablate the underlying disease despite increments in chemoradiotherapy and ABMT.\n",
      "It is well established that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal is regulated through phosphorylation-dependent activation by the three-tiered MAPK cascade. However, our studies on the interaction of the MAPK ERK5 with the tyrosine kinase c-Abl and its oncogenic variants v-Abl and Bcr/Abl disclosed an alternative aspect of regulation. Independent of the MAPK cascade, Abl kinases were able to regulate the cellular amount of ERK5, at least in part, by stabilizing the protein. The resulting level of ERK5 and its intrinsic basal activity, but not necessarily its activation, were essential and sufficient to increase transformation by v-Abl and to mediate survival of Bcr/Abl-expressing leukaemia cells. These results suggest that the ability to regulate the cellular abundance of ERK5 contributes to the oncogenic potential of Abl kinases.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Disturbance of the delicate balance between self-renewal and differentiation in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can lead to both leukaemia and bone marrow failure. The regulation of this balance in HSC biology has been intensely investigated in several model systems, and lately the importance of epigenetic modifications as well as the organization and architecture of chromatin has become increasingly recognized. In this review, we will focus on the role of the chromatin organizing protein complex cohesin in regulation of normal and malignant haematopoiesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Several functional studies in both mouse and human systems have implicated cohesin as a critical regulator of self-renewal and differentiation in HSCs. Together with the discovery of recurrent mutations of cohesin genes in myeloid malignancies, this points towards a direct role of perturbed cohesin function in leukemogenesis. SUMMARY: The work reviewed here provides new insights about the role of the cohesin complex and chromatin architecture in normal and malignant HSCs, and indicates how cohesin may be specifically targeted for therapeutic benefit in the future.\n",
      "Leukaemic patients with advanced disease and severe fungal infections as well as older patients with substantial co-morbidity are usually excluded from conventional allotransplantation because of increased morbidity and mortality. We approached allogeneic transplantation in four patients with a median age of 62 years (one chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis, one high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1), one AML in 2nd relapse, one AML in CR2 with pre-existing fungal lung infections (two aspergillus, two mucor) and additional co-morbidity (diabetes n = 2, aortic aneurysm n = 1, arterial sclerosis n = 2) by combining non-myeloablative conditioning with an intensified supportive care regimen, including amphotericin B and 4-12 (median 9) prophylactic granulocyte transfusions from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-stimulated volunteer donors. G-CSF was also given to patients until neutrophil recovery. All four patients recovered to a neutrophil count of 0.5 x 109/l after a median of 11.5 d (range 11-13 d). Prophylactic granulocyte transfusions also reduced the need for platelet transfusions and minimized mucositis. All patients were discharged at a median of 25 d (range 18-59 d) and are alive and well after a median follow-up of > 390 d (range 336-417 d) without evidence of leukaemia. Regression of the fungal lesions was documented in three patients, with a slight progression detected by computerized tomography scan of the chest in one patient. We conclude that pulmonary fungal infections are not a contraindication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, if non-myeloablative conditioning regimens are used in combination with granulocyte transfusions, intravenous amphotericin B and G-CSF.\n",
      "Objective The prognostic effect of miR-196a/b expression in adult patients with leukaemia remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether miR-196a/b expression can serve as a prognostic factor for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Methods We enrolled 124 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. We measured miR-196a/b expression by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We classified patients into high and low expression groups based on the median expression value. Cox regression analyses were carried out to assess the prognostic significance of miR-196a/b expression in the context of well-established predictors. Results Patients with high miR-196a/b expression were older in age, and had higher white blood cell and platelet counts than did patients with low miR-196a/b expression. Patients with high miR-196a/b expression were associated with the French-American-British classification M5 subtype and with the presence of nucleophosmin and FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations, but were not associated with the favourable karyotype risk subgroup. Moreover, patients with high miR-196a/b expression had a shorter event-free survival rate compared with those with low miR-196a/b expression in univariate and multivariate analyses. Conclusion High miR-196a/b expression is associated with poor event-free survival.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Regulation in adaptive immune response balances a fine line that prevents instigation of self-damage or fall into unresponsiveness permitting abnormal cell growth. Mechanisms that keep this balance in check include regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs consist of a small but heterogeneous population, which may be identified by the phenotype, CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127-. The role of Tregs in pathogenesis of cancers is thus far supported by evidence of increased Tregs in various cancers and may contribute to poorer prognosis. Tregs may also be important in acute leukaemias. OBJECTIVE: A review of the literature on Tregs in acute leukaemias was conducted and Tregs were determined in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALLs). RESULTS: Studies on Tregs in B-cell ALL are few and controversial. We observed a significantly increased percentage of Tregs (mean±SD, 9.72 ± 3.79% vs. 7.05 ± 1.74%; P = 0.047) in the bone marrow/peripheral blood of ALL (n = 17) compared to peripheral blood of normal controls (n = 35). A positive trend between Tregs and age (R = 0.474, P = 0.055, n = 17) implicates this factor of poor prognosis in B-cell ALL. DISCUSSION: Tregs in cancer are particularly significant in immunotherapy. The manipulation of the immune system to treat cancer has for a long time ignored regulatory mechanisms inducible or in place. In lymphoma studies, tumour-specific mechanisms that are unlike conventional methods in the induction of Tregs have been hypothesized. In addition, tumour-infiltrating Tregs may present different profiles from peripheral blood pictures. Tregs will continue to be dissected to reveal its mysteries and their impact on clinical significance.\n",
      "The administration of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was associated with complete clinical and haematological response in an adult patient with minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukaemia who presented with pneumonia and moderate neutropenia, but no blast cells in the peripheral blood. The response lasted 9 months. At relapse, a second GM-CSF course resulted in a very good partial remission lasting 5 months, although differences in the kinetics of haemoglobin, neutrophil and platelet recovery were noted. Subsequent recurrences were managed with chemotherapy, a complete remission being obtained twice more and lastly consolidated with myeloablative chemo-radiotherapy supported by a peripheral blood stem cell autograft. This report suggests that GM-CSF should be further investigated as a therapeutic agent in selected cases of AML.\n",
      "gamma Interferon receptor (gamma IFNR) expression was examined by Scatchard analysis in 49 patients with various haemic malignancies. In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (20 cases) expression was variable but generally low (0-1600 receptors/cell) and was not related to clinical stage. In hairy-cell leukaemia (HCL) (n = 6), prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) (n = 1) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n = 4) expression was again variable but was significantly higher than in CLL (500-4500 receptors/cell). In the myeloid proliferations (n = 18) receptor numbers were significantly higher than in the lymphoproliferative disorders as a whole (1000-30,000) and the highest level of expression was observed in primitive monocytoid proliferations.\n",
      "The occurrence of opportunistic pathogens and the concentration of some antimicrobial factors in the oral cavity of both acute and chronic leukaemia patients were studied. Enterobacteria were isolated from both dental plaque and crevicular fluid of all the groups examined, with few differences between healthy volunteers and leukaemic subjects; yeasts were found in both the crevicular fluid and the dental plaque samples of chronic leukaemia patients, but only in the plaque of healthy volunteers. Acute leukaemia patients did not have yeasts, but they were the only group colonized by the pseudomonads. IgA and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) significantly increased in chronic leukaemia patients compared with controls, whilst lysozyme seemed to present no marked differences for all groups. A further increase in NAGase concentration and an elevation in lysozyme content of saliva was observed for chronic leukaemia patients with severe periodontal lesions.\n"

      "Mercapturic acid pathway metabolites of phenylethyl isothiocyanate inhibited the growth of human leukaemia 60 (HL60) cells in vitro. The adduct with L-cysteine, S-(N-phenylethylthiocarbamoyl)cysteine, was the most potent with strong antileukaemic activity: the median growth inhibitory concentration (GC50) value was 336 +/- 1 nM (N = 18) compared with GC50 values of the precursor formed from dietary glucosinolates, phenylethyl isothiocyanate, 1.49 +/- 0.01 microM (N = 8), and the initial mercapturic acid pathway metabolite S-(N-phenylethylthiocarbamoyl)glutathione 5.46 +/- 0.36 microM (N = 18). S-(N-Benzylthiocarbamoyl)cysteine and S-(N-phenylpropylthiocarbamoyl)cysteine also had antiproliferative activity but S-(N-phenylethylthiocarbamoyl)cysteine was the most potent compound studied. The latter induced DNA fragmentation in HL60 cells but DNA laddering characteristic of apoptosis was not observed. It had low toxicity to corresponding differentiated cells, neutrophils, in culture, and therefore the cytotoxicity had selectivity for leukaemia cells. The antiproliferative activity of S-(N-phenylethylthiocarbamoyl)cysteine was lost during preincubation with culture medium, attributed to s-thiocarbamoyl transfer to serum proteins, which may decrease its effectiveness in vivo. The antiproliferative activity of S-(N-phenylalkylthiocarbamoyl)cysteine derivatives, by inhibiting tumour growth in pre-clinical development, may contribute to the association of decreased cancer incidence with dietary glucosinolate consumption.\n",
      "Children with trisomy 21 have a unique predisposition to develop a megakaryoblastic proliferative disease of varying severity during their first 3 months of life. This disorder exists in no other children or adults without the presence of trisomy 21 and only occurs in the fetal or neonatal period of life. Its spontaneous resolution in most cases further delineates it from otherwise indistinguishable neonatal leukaemias. The identification that GATA1 mutations are the leukaemogenic source along with three recently reported prospective clinical trials now provide a clearer understanding of this haematopoietic disorder. These recent advances in this enigmatic disorder, now known as Transient Myeloproliferative Disorder, are reviewed here in order to bring clarity to the breadth of organ involvement, the range of severity, the risk factors for mortality, the therapeutic options for severe manifestations, the natural course of spontaneous resolution regardless of therapy, and the elucidation of the subsequent risk for myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Maternal hormonal contraception has been suspected of being linked to an increased risk of childhood cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the association between maternal use of hormonal contraception and diagnosis of leukaemia in their children. METHODS: In this cohort study, we followed a nationwide cohort of 1 185 157 liveborn children between 1996 and 2014 listed in the Danish Medical Birth Registry and identified those diagnosed with leukaemia in the Danish Cancer Registry. Redeemed prescriptions from the Danish National Prescription Registry provided information about maternal hormonal contraceptive use, categorised as: no use (never used contraception before birth; reference category), previous use (>3 months before start of pregnancy), and recent use (≤3 months before and during pregnancy). We also calculated risk estimates separately for maternal hormonal contraceptive use during pregnancy. The primary outcome of interest was a diagnosis of any leukaemia in the children. Secondary outcomes were diagnoses of lymphoid leukaemia and non-lymphoid leukaemia. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for risk of leukaemia in children. The Data Protection Agency registration number for this study is 2017-41-5221. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2014, the 1 185 157 liveborn children accumulated 11 114 290 person-years of follow-up (median 9·3 years, IQR 4·6-14·2), during which 606 children were diagnosed with leukaemia (465 with lymphoid leukaemia and 141 with non-lymphoid leukaemia). Children born to women with recent use of any type of hormonal contraception were at higher risk for any leukaemia than children of women who never used contraception (HR 1·46, 95% CI 1·09-1·96; p=0·011); and for exposure during pregancy the risk was 1·78 (0·95-3·31; p=0·070). No association was found between timing of use and risk for lymphoid leukaemia (HR 1·23, 95% CI 0·97-1·57, p=0·089, for previous use and 1·27, 0·90-1·80, p=0·167, for recent use); however, the HRs for non-lymphoid leukaemia were 2·17 (1·22-3·87; p=0·008) for recent use and 3·87 (1·48-10·15; p=0·006) for use during pregnancy. Hormonal contraception use close to or during pregnancy might have resulted in one additional case of leukaemia per about 50 000 exposed children, or 25 cases during the 9-year study period. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest the maternal hormonal use affects non-lymphoid leukaemia development in children. Since almost no risk factors have been established for childhood leukaemia, these findings suggest an important direction for future research into its causes and prevention. FUNDING: The Danish Cancer Research Foundation, the Arvid Nilssons Foundation, the Gangsted Foundation, the Harboe Foundation, and the Johannes Clemmesens Foundation.\n",
      "In a prospective study of 27 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) quality of life was studied using three different instruments, Life Ingredient Profile, Karnofsky Performance Scale and Vitagram. The course of the disease was followed during the induction period, remission, relapse and in the terminal phase. We found that induction treatment entailed physical and psychological distress with decreased quality of life but with continued ability to enjoy various leisure activities. Patients who survived experienced a change of attitude with regard to what was important in their lives. They reverted to their earlier lifestyle within 2 years.\n",
      "STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine a cohort of cases of childhood cancer occurring in a defined geographical area to try to identify clustering and possible causative factors. DESIGN: Data were analysed using the close pair method developed by Knox for signs of clustering in relation to date and place of onset or date and place of birth. SETTING: Cases were those occurring in the 8 year period between 1953 and 1960 in four old counties of the Midlands of England (Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire). CASES: 418 children under 10 years developed cancers during the study period: leukaemia 228, cerebral tumour 99, neuroblastoma 45, nephroblastoma 46. It is thought that data collection was complete. Cases were matched for region, sex and date of birth with live controls. RESULTS: There was evidence among some age groups and diagnoses of an unexpectedly high number of close pairs of onsets, and some indication of similar patterns among births of children who later developed cancer. The pre- and postnatal experiences of children involved in close pairs were examined to see whether they differed from those of control children. Measles appeared to occur more often in the 2-3 years before the onset of leukaemia in children who were later involved in close pairs than in their matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Common infectious diseases of childhood may play a minor role in the development of some cancers. Epidemics of these diseases may then be reflected on a greatly reduced scale in the subsequent distribution of cancer cases.\n",
      "Granulocytic sarcomas (GS) are extramedullary tumour masses of immature myeloid cells, also known as chloroma and extramedullary myeloid cell tumour. These neoplasms usually occur simultaneously with, or follow the onset of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Rarely, they are the first manifestation of AML. GS may also be the first sign of transformation to AML in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes. GS have been reported to occur in a variety of tissues, but presentation as an abdominal mass and, in particular, infiltration of the pancreas is rare. We report two cases of pancreatic GS, review the literature, and discuss recent insights into the basic biological properties of these rare tumours.\n",
      "In many areas of medicine adolescents are regarded as a discrete group with specific therapeutic, psychological, educational, and resource needs. In the treatment of acute leukemia age is a predictor of response. Thus, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) there is a clearly poorer treatment outcome after puberty, while in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is more common in older adults, age is a continuous variable with poorer outcomes in each successive decade. Much is known about other prognostic factors and their relative incidence in each age stratum. Although there is some segregation of favorable factors with relative youth, age usually remains an independent factor with respect to prognosis. Adolescents may be included in pediatric or adult-oriented treatment protocols. Here we discuss the outcome of acute leukemia in adolescents and young adults, particularly with respect to whether they respond similarly to children or other adults.\n",
      "Immunophenotyping is considered to be less valuable in the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) compared with acute lymphoid leukaemias. Here, we present data on the use of quantitative flow cytometry (QFC) of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1, CD162) and three-colour immunophenotyping including CD162 staining in the identification of myeloid precursors in AML. Analysis of normal peripheral blood (n = 20) and normal bone marrow (n = 5) samples and on 20 samples from de novo M1, M2, M4 and M5 AML patients demonstrated that PSGL-1 is differentially expressed on various mature and immature leucocyte subsets. It was found by QFC that neutrophils expressed 26500 +/- 4500 and monocytes 47200 +/- 9900 copies of PSGL-1 on their surface, whereas AML blasts from M1 and M2 AML patients expressed significantly less PSGL-1 (12 000 +/- 5300) than mature neutrophils (P < 0.001). In M4 and M5 leukaemias, however, the amount of PSGL-1 on monocytic precursors is displayed in a fairly broad range that is not significantly different from that of mature monocytes (P = 0.084). Using three-colour immunophenotyping PSGL-1-dim staining was co-expressed with CD7 and C34 positivity and PSGL-1 staining intensity on immature myeloid cells paralleled with CD45 expression. This would imply a differential expression of PSGL-1 during myeloid haematopoietic development and suggests that quantification of surface PSGL-1 may aid in differentiating myeloblasts from monoblasts by immunophenotyping in different AML subsets.\n",
      "The concept of leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) was experimentally suggested 25 years ago through seminal data from John Dick group, who showed that a small fraction of cells from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients were able to be adoptively transferred into immunodeficient mice. The initial estimation of the frequency was 1:250 000 leukaemic cells, clearly indicating the difficulties ahead in translating knowledge on LSCs to the clinical setting. However, the field has steadily grown in interest, expanse and importance, concomitantly with the realisation of the molecular background for AML culminating in the sequencing of hundreds of AML genomes. The literature is now ripe with contributions describing how different molecular aberrations are more or less specific for LSCs, as well as reports showing selectivity in targeting LSCs in comparison to normal haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. However, we argue here that these important data have not yet been fully realised within the clinical setting. In this clinically focused review, we outline the difficulties in identifying and defining LSCs at the individual patient level, with special emphasis on intraclonal heterogeneity. In addition, we suggest areas of future focus in order to realise the concept as real-time benefit for AML patients.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of ocular manifestations in childhood acute leukaemia at the time of presentation. METHODS: Eighty-two children with acute leukaemia were examined for ocular lesions within two days of diagnosis before starting chemotherapy. The detailed ocular examination of both eyes was carried out by the ophthalmologist irrespective of the presence or absence of eye symptoms in all cases. RESULTS: Only 3 out of 82 children presented with eye symptoms (3.6%). However, ocular changes were found in 14 children (17%); ten with lymphoblastic and four with myeloid leukaemia. The ocular lesions observed were proptosis, intraretinal haemorrhages, white centered haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, macular haemorrhage, subhyaloid haemorrhage, vitreous haemorrhage, papilloedema, cortical blindness, sixth nerve palsy, and exudative retinal detachment with choroidal infiltration. CONCLUSION: In view of the high prevalence of asymptomatic ocular lesions in childhood acute leukaemia, routine ophthalmic examination should be included as a part of evaluation at the time of diagnosis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Acute leukaemia is a group of rapidly progressing cancers of bone marrow and blood classified as either acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has developed as an adjunct to or replacement for conventional chemotherapy with the aim of improving survival and quality of life. OBJECTIVES: A systematic overview of the best available evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SCT in the treatment of acute leukaemia. DATA SOURCES: Clinical effectiveness: electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, were searched from inception to December 2008 to identify published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation Index (SCI) were searched from 1997 to March 2009 to identify primary studies. Cost-effectiveness: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) were searched from inception to January 2009. STUDY SELECTION: Potentially relevant papers were retrieved and independently checked against predefined criteria by two reviewers (one in the case of the cost-effectiveness review). STUDY APPRAISAL: Included reviews and meta-analyses were critically appraised and data extracted and narratively presented. Included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and donor versus no donor (DvND) studies were mapped to the evidence covered in existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses according to a framework of 12 decision problems (DPs): DP1 related to SCT in adults with AML in first complete remission (CR1); DP2 to adults with AML in second or subsequent remission or with refractory disease (CR2+); DP3 to children with AML in CR1; DP4 to children with AML in CR2+; DP5 to adults with ALL in CR1; DP6 to adults with ALL in CR2+; DP7 to children with ALL in CR1; DP8 to children with ALL in CR2+; DP9 to comparison of different sources of stem cells in transplantation; DP10 to different conditioning regimens; DP11 to the use of purging in autologous SCT; and DP12 to the use of T-cell depletion in allogeneic SCT. RESULTS: Fifteen systematic reviews/meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria for the review of clinical effectiveness, thirteen of which were published from 2004 onwards. Taking into account the timing of their publications, most reviews appeared to have omitted an appreciable proportion of potentially available evidence. The best available evidence for effectiveness of allogeneic SCT using stem cells from matched sibling donors came from DvND studies: there was sufficient evidence to support the use of allogeneic SCT in DP1 (except in good-risk patients), DP3 (role of risk stratification unclear) and DP5 (role of risk stratification unclear). There was conflicting evidence in DP7 and a paucity of evidence from DvND studies for all decision problems concerning patient groups in CR2+. The best available evidence for effectiveness of autologous SCT came from RCTs: overall, evidence suggested that autologous SCT was either similar to or less effective than chemotherapy. There was a paucity of evidence from published reviews of RCTs for DPs 9-12. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria in the cost-effectiveness review, most reporting only cost information and only one incorporating an economic model. Although there is a wealth of information on costs and some information on cost-effectiveness of allogeneic SCT in adults with AML (DPs 1 and 2), there is very limited evidence on relative costs and cost-effectiveness for other DPs. LIMITATIONS: Time and resources did not permit critical appraisal of the primary studies on which the reviews/meta-analyses reviewed were based; there were substantial differences in methodologies, and consequently quantitative synthesis of data was neither planned in the protocol nor carried out; some of the studies were quite old and might not reflect current practice; and a number of the studies might not be applicable to the UK. CONCLUSIONS: Bearing in mind the limitations, existing evidence suggests that sibling donor allogeneic SCT may be more effective than chemotherapy in adult AML (except in good-risk patients) in CR1, childhood AML in CR1 and adult ALL in CR1, and that autologous SCT is equal to or less effective than chemotherapy. No firm conclusions could be drawn regarding the cost-effectiveness of SCT in the UK NHS owing to the limitations given above. Future research should include the impact of the treatments on patients' quality of life as well as information on health service use and costs associated with SCT from the perspective of the UK NHS.\n",
      "Topoisomerase II (topo II) is the target enzyme of etoposide, and DNA--topo II complex accumulation is considered crucial for the cytotoxic effect. We used a SDS--KCl precipitation assay to determine the complex accumulation induced by etoposide in leukaemic cells isolated from 58 patients, 31 with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), and 27 with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). To investigate whether the sensitivity towards etoposide was dependent on the complex accumulation in the cells, we investigated the drug-induced DNA damage using a DNA unwinding assay and the in vitro cytotoxicity of etoposide using the MTT assay. AML cells had higher complex accumulation (P=0.006) and more DNA damage (P=0.029) compared with CLL cells. The data support a relationship between etoposide-induced complex accumulation and DNA damage in leukaemic cells from AML and CLL patients. However, the induced DNA damage did not translate to in vitro cytotoxicity, suggesting that other factors, such as DNA repair and apoptosis functions, also play important roles to determine the etoposide sensitivity.\n",
      "The development of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a frequent cause of treatment failure in acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukaemia. The mechanisms by which resistance develops in these patients are poorly understood, although a framework for their investigation has been provided by a range of studies using animal and human cell lines as model systems. In this review the basic concepts of drug resistance mechanisms are outlined, with special emphasis on studies using cells obtained from patients with resistant forms of leukaemia.\n",
      "We describe the clinical, haematological and cytogenetic features of three patients who had acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) with complex bone marrow karyotypes when first cytogenetically examined. Induction chemotherapy led to remission from the acute leukaemia. However, neither clinically nor morphologically did this remission mean a return to normal haematopoiesis. The two patients who displayed myelodysplastic features before and when AML was diagnosed, again developed myelodysplasia, and the third patient, who had a long history of polycythaemia vera, returned to this myeloproliferative condition. Nor was cytogenetic normalization achieved; instead, abnormal cell clones were found in which all but one of the karyotypic aberrations present at acute leukaemia diagnosis had disappeared. The solitary anomalies that were detected in these reemerging clones must correspond to the primary cytogenetic aberrations of the patients pre-leukaemic diseases. They were del(5) (q11q33) and del(17) (p11) in the two myelodysplastic cases, and der(18)t(9;18) (p11;p11) in the patient with long-standing polycythaemia vera. The other, secondary, aberrations were probably the leukaemogenic changes, and with the eradication or reduction of the subclones containing them, the leukaemic phenotype disappeared. The three cases add cytogenetic evidence to the growing understanding that the remission obtained in some AMLs is actually a return to a preleukaemic, myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic, syndrome.\n",
      "We report three cases of acute leukaemia with t(4;11) (q21;q23), one of them of undifferentiated and the other two of lymphoid phenotype, occurring after adjuvant radiochemotherapy for breast cancer (two cases) or occupational exposure to radiation (one case). Although the myeloid phenotype and characteristic chromosomal anomalies usually observed in secondary leukaemia were lacking, our observations raise the possibility of causal relationship between exposure to carcinogens and the occurrence of a leukaemia with t(4;11).\n",
      "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To review the incidence of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children and young adults in the area less than 25 km from the Dounreay nuclear installation and the remainder of the Kirkwall postcode area in the full time period for which data are now available (1968-91), and to determine whether the excess incidence reported in the period up to 1984 has continued in subsequent years. DESIGN: Geographical incidence study. SETTING: The Kirkwall postcode area of Scotland. SUBJECTS: Children and young adults resident in the area in the period 1968-91. MAIN RESULTS: Observed numbers of cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and observed to expected ratios with expected numbers based on Scottish national rates were determined. In 1968-91, 12 cases were observed compared with 5.2 expected in the zone < 25 km from the Dounreay plant (p = 0.007). In the latest period, 1985-91, which has not previously been examined, four cases were observed compared with 1.4 expected (p = 0.059). CONCLUSION: The observation of an excess of borderline statistical significance in 1985-91 following the substantial excess incidence which occurred in the early 1980s suggests that the incidence of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in this area should continue to be a matter of concern. The phenomenon of high incidences of childhood and young adult leukaemia and lymphoma near some nuclear installations in isolated areas is yet to be explained, but certain aspects of the data examined in the present report are consistent with the hypothesis of an infectious aetiology for leukaemia in very young children.\n",
      "Since the WHO classification of haematological malignancies recommended the description of global entities, we performed a national M7-AML study to correlate morphological, immunological and cytogenetic features, and to find new clinically relevant M7 entities. This study is based on accurate morphological and immunological study to select pure megakaryoblastic proliferations and to eliminate megakaryocytic participation in haemopathies. We collected 53 cases: 23 adults and 30 children. We confirm the wide heterogeneity of adult M7. In adults, the cytogenetic abnormalities are frequently those of secondary leukaemia while a few patients have a previous history and morphological features of dyshaematopoiesis; their outcome is very poor. Among children, besides the well-known Down syndrome M7, we in particular, studied ten t(1;22) M7 and one OTT-MAL transcript positive case with normal karyotype presenting specific features. We were already aware of their younger age, female and tumoral presentation, but we also found a lower percentage of bone marrow blasts, sometimes without any megakaryoblastic bone marrow involvement, but always, with a dysmegakaryocytopoiesis associated with micromegakaryocytes. They are generally good responders to intensive AML chemotherapy with very long disease-free survivals (DFS). Accordingly, OTT-MAL transcript study, in infant M7 with normal karyotype, is recommended and we feel that this entity should be added to the WHO AML classification.\n",
      "Paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterised by the malignant transformation of myeloid precursor cells with impaired differentiation. Standard therapy for paediatric AML has remained largely unchanged for over four decades and, combined with inadequate understanding of the biology of paediatric AML, has limited the progress of targeted therapies in this cohort. In recent years, the search for novel targets for the treatment of paediatric AML has accelerated in parallel with advanced genomic technologies which explore the mutational and transcriptional landscape of this disease. Exploiting the large combinatorial space of existing drugs provides an untapped resource for the identification of potential combination therapies for the treatment of paediatric AML. We have previously designed a multiplex screening strategy known as Multiplex Screening for Interacting Compounds in AML (MuSICAL); using an algorithm designed in-house, we screened all pairings of 384 FDA-approved compounds in less than 4000 wells by pooling drugs into 10 compounds per well. This approach maximised the probability of identifying new compound combinations with therapeutic potential while minimising cost, replication and redundancy. This screening strategy identified the triple combination of glimepiride, a sulfonylurea; pancuronium dibromide, a neuromuscular blocking agent; and vinblastine sulfate, a vinca alkaloid, as a potential therapy for paediatric AML. We envision that this approach can be used for a variety of disease-relevant screens allowing the efficient repurposing of drugs that can be rapidly moved into the clinic.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Daunorubicin is used clinically in the treatment of myeloma, acute lymphatic and myelocytic leukaemia. The toxic lesions caused by daunorubicin induce various modes of cell death, including apoptosis. Apoptosis is highly regulated programmed cell death that can be initiated mainly via two pathways, through death receptors (extrinsic) or involvement of the mitochondria (intrinsic). Induction of apoptosis via these pathways has been alluded following treatment with daunorubicin, but never compared in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia over a time course. METHODS: This study investigated the mechanisms of daunorubicin induced apoptosis in the treatment of CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4 (acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia) and SUP-B15 (acute B-lymphoblastic leukaemia) cells. Cells were treated with daunorubicin for 4 h, and then placed in recovery medium (without daunorubicin) for 4 h, 12 h and 24 h. Apoptotic response was analysing using annexin-V expression, caspase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential change and an array to detect 43 apoptotic proteins. RESULTS: Daunorubicin induced apoptosis in all leukemic cell lines, but with different levels and duration of response. Both apoptosis levels and caspase activity increased after four hours recovery then declined in CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 cells. However, SUP-B15 cells displayed initially comparable levels but remained elevated over the 24 h assessment period. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential occurred in both MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM cells but not in SUP-B15 cells. Expression of apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3 and FADD, indicated that daunorubicin potentially induced both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis in both CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 cells, but only extrinsic apoptosis in SUP-B15 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes variations in sensitivities and timing of apoptotic responses in different leukaemia cell lines. These differences could be attributed to the lack of functional p53 in coordinating the cells response following cytotoxic treatment with daunorubicin, which appears to delay apoptosis and utilises alternative signalling mechanisms that need to be further explored.\n",
      "A 2-year-old, spayed female domestic shorthair cat was referred with a history of anorexia and depression of 1 week duration. On physical examination, the cat was lethargic and febrile, with splenomegaly, anisocoria and ulcerative stomatitis. A complete blood count (CBC) and a biochemistry profile showed leukocytosis, numerous blast cells in the peripheral blood, thrombocytopenia, hyperglobulinaemia and a positive test for feline leukaemia virus antigen. A diagnosis of acute myelomonocytic leukaemia was made on the basis of the results of bone marrow cytology, histopathology, and immunochemistry (CD3, CD79a, lysozyme, and myeloperoxidase) tests. Following an unexpected 1-month period of clinical and clinicopathological remission without chemotherapy, the cat relapsed and died 1 week later.\n",
      "The incidence and clinical implications of unusual patterns of expression of leucocyte differentiation antigens in acute leukaemia were assessed on 568 newly diagnosed paediatric and adult cases undergoing immunophenotyping with a panel of monoclonal antibodies at a single centre. Among patients with the precursor B (common) form of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the major variant seen was the group of 15 cases with expression of myeloid surface antigens. 4.5% of ALL cases tested with antibody to CD-11b were positive, 5.1% were CD-13+, and 10.8% CD-33+. All 15 patients achieved a complete remission with chemotherapy, with six of eight children and four of seven adults remaining disease free. A smaller proportion (1.5%) of precursor B ALL patients showed expression of the T lineage marker, CD-7. The only significant variant seen in the precursor T-ALL group was expression of HLA-DR antigen, which was found in five of 35 cases; although all responded to treatment, only one remains a disease-free survivor. Among patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), expression of the lymphoid markers terminal transferase (TdT) and CD-7 were commonly seen (22.2% and 28.4% respectively of cases tested). Other lymphoid markers detected on AML cases were CD2 (11.1%), CD-10 (1%) and CD-19 (4.4%). These results confirm that examples of lineage infidelity are regularly seen in large series of patients with acute leukaemia. Prospective studies using uniform treatment protocols are required to establish whether these patients have significantly different disease outcomes.\n",
      "Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) is a rare haematopoietic stem cell disease of early childhood, which can progress to blast crisis in some children. A total of 153 children diagnosed with JMML were reported to the Myelodysplastic Syndrome Committee in Japan between 1989 and 2007; 15 of them (9·8%) had 20% or more blasts in the bone marrow (blast crisis) during the disease course. Blast crisis occurred during observation without therapy (n = 3) or with oral 6-mercaptopurine treatment (n = 9) and in relapse after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; n = 3). Six patients had a complex karyotype (5 including monosomy 7) and an additional three patients had isolated monosomy 7 at blast crisis. Seven patients received HSCT after blast crisis and four of them achieved remission. Eleven out of the 15 patients died; the cause of death was disease progression in 10 patients and transplant-related complication in one patient. In summary, patients with blast crisis have poor prognosis and can be cured only by HSCT. The emergence of monosomy 7 and complex karyotype may be characteristic of blast crisis in a substantial subset of children.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pain, fatigue, sleep disorders and quality of life and assess the most powerful predictor of quality of life in patients with acute leukaemia. In this cross-sectional multicentre study, 406 patients were recruited. Data were collected using the Iranian Short-Form 36-item Health Survey, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Numeric Rating Scale for Pain and Fatigue Intensity. It was found that pain and fatigue had direct relationship with sleep disorders. Statistically significant relationships were reported between pain, fatigue, sleep disorders and QoL. Also, a statistically significant relationship was found between pain and QoL (p < .001). Pain, fatigue and sleep disorders in total had the predictive power for quality of life (R2  = 36%). The most powerful predictor of quality of life was pain. It is suggested that healthcare professionals note the importance of patients' symptoms in clinical investigations and take appropriate measures for their management. The assessment of pain as the most powerful predictor of quality of life can be considered a basis for the improvement of quality of life, fatigue and sleep quality in patients with acute leukaemia.\n",
      "HLA-A,B specificities were analysed on the neoplastic blasts of a panel of 69 lymphoblastic (ALL) and 50 non lymphoblastic (ANLL) acute leukaemias at onset using the standard lymphocytotoxicity technique. Analysis of the number of detected specificities per locus and, when possible, comparison of the results with those obtained on lymphocytes of the same patients during remission revealed many alterations in the expression of A,B specificities including extra specificities both at the HLA-A and -B loci mainly on lymphoblasts and missed specificities mainly at the HLA-B locus on myeloblasts. Lack of A,B antigens was complete in 6.2% of all tested samples (9% of ANLL) and selective for all the products of one locus in 16.8% of all tested samples (27.7% of ANLL). A decrease of class I molecules on the cell surface was evidenced with MoAb W6/32 on blasts missing detectable serological specificities.\n",
      "We compared the impact of a conditioning regimen with BU (n=16) or fractionated TBI (n=42) on height growth during adolescence and final height (FH), in 58 adults transplanted for acute leukaemia before adolescence (younger than 9 for girls and 11 for boys, and prepubertal). Heights were measured at three key periods, that is, transplantation, before adolescence, and FH, and compared using height standard deviation score (SDS) and cumulative change in SDS. The influence of the conditioning regimen was assessed using multiple linear regression and adjusting for gender, central nervous system irradiation, age and leukaemia status at transplant and type of transplantation. Overall mean height SDS was near normal at transplantation and before adolescence (0.2+/-0.1 and -0.2+/-0.1, respectively), but decreased to -1.6+/-0.1 at FH. There were significant differences between the TBI and BU groups when comparing FH SDS (-1.8+/-0.2 vs -0.8+/-0.2, P=0.001), mean change in height SDS from transplantation to FH (-2+/-0.1 vs -1.1+/-0.2, P=0.002) and mean change in height SDS during adolescence (-1.6+/-0.1 vs -0.7+/-0.2, P=0.003). We conclude that preparations involving BU, although less toxic than TBI-containing regimens, also have adverse effects on growth, predominantly during adolescence.\n",
      "Bone marrow transplantation from a histocompatible sibling donor may produce complete remission in patients with induction failure or relapsed acute leukaemia. Through the National Marrow Donor Program, histocompatible bone marrow from unrelated donors has become available for high-risk patients. In this study we analyse the results of matched unrelated bone marrow transplant in 55 patients with highly advanced acute myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. 28 patients with advanced acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 27 patients with advanced acute myelogenous leukaemia, age 2-51, were treated with high-dose chemoradiotherapy and transplantation of 6/6 HLA matched (n = 46) or one antigen mismatched (n = 9) unrelated donor bone marrow. After a median follow-up of 36 months, 13 patients remain alive 17-74 months after transplant for a 2-year actuarial disease-free and overall survival of 23 +/- 12% (median disease-free survival 3.5 months). The actuarial risk of relapse is 24 +/- 16% at 1 year. Moderate to severe graft-versus-host disease occurred in 27/47 evaluable patients (57%). Significant prognostic factors for poor leukaemia-free survival include age > 21, abnormal karyotype, and active leukaemia at the time of transplant. Other pretreatment characteristics such as gender or type of leukaemia were not significant prognostic factors. Our results show that matched unrelated bone marrow transplant for patients with advanced acute leukaemia may provide long-term leukaemia-free survival, but transplant-related complications produce a significant impact on survival with older age and adverse disease characteristics predicting for poor prognosis.\n",
      "Fludarabine (Fludara) is a new purine analogue that was first entered into clinical trials in 1982. Results of initial studies with high dosages (> 96 mg/m2/day for 5 to 7 days) of fludarabine in acute leukaemia showed significant cytoreductive activity but a high incidence of severe irreversible neurotoxicity. The results of subsequent studies with lower dosages of 25 to 30 mg/m2/day for 5 days in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and low grade lymphomas have shown this regimen to be effective and safe, with almost no significant neurotoxicity. At present, the major role of fludarabine in leukaemia is in the management of CLL. In previously treated patients with CLL, responses are obtained in more than 50% of patients, with two-thirds of those responses being complete remissions according to the National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCIWG) criteria for complete response and partial response. The major causes of morbidity associated with fludarabine in CLL are infections and febrile episodes. These occur more frequently in previously treated patients and those with advanced stage of disease. Myelosuppression is dose limiting and a small proportion of patients with CLL develop moderate to severe and sometimes protracted myelosuppression. Administration of combined fludarabine and cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside; ara-C) alone (FA regimen) or together with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG regimen) produced high response rates in previously treated refractory patients with acute leukaemia and previously untreated patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. The wide range of biochemical and biological activities of fludarabine suggests that it will have an expanding role in future combinations in the treatment of both acute and chronic leukaemias.\n",
      "GOALS OF WORK: The selection process of type of central venous access device (CVAD) in patients with acute leukaemia (AL) is generally based on appropriate catheter capacity/function and risk of complications in relation to the planned length of therapy. Advantages and disadvantages of the CVAD from the patient perspective should also be important parts in the selection of type of device. Perceptions on having a CVAD were thus analysed in a series of adult patients with AL included in a prospective randomised study evaluating the use of a double lumen totally implantable subcutaneous port system (PORT) or a double lumen central venous catheter (CVC) regarding survival time and complication rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Perceptions were registered in 32 patients (median age 68 years, range 24-83 years) on three occasions (T1; the day after placement, T2; 3 weeks after placement and T3 after 12 weeks and/or when the CVAD was removed) with the use of two study specific questionnaires. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, many patients reported minor catheter related discomfort, feelings of anxiety and restrictions. Half of the patients (6/11) who experienced a local bleeding after CVAD insertion described the placement procedure as unpleasant. More patients in the CVC group compared with the PORT group stated that they thought of having a CVAD (T3; p = 0.02) and that the CVAD interfered when dressing themselves (T2; p = 0.02 and T3; 0.04) or taking a shower (T3; p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Our findings support the view that the PORT is less restrictive in daily life than the CVC.\n",
      "In order to increase the damaging effects on specific DNA sequences and decrease the subsequent toxicity, the use of homo-aza-steroidal esters of nitrogen mustards is already known. Two specific homo-aza-steroidal esters were mixed at different proportions and the resultant final mixtures were tested in vivo and in vitro. The effects of these on P388 and L1210 leukaemias, on SCE rates and on human lymphocyte proliferation kinetics were studied. The results demonstrate that the combined substances enhanced SCE induction (p < 0.05) and antitumour activity (p < 0.02) in a synergistic manner. A correlation was observed (p < 0.001) between the magnitude of the SCE response and the depression of the cell proliferation index.\n",
      "Forty-one mothers and 30 fathers were interviewed to examine their perceptions of (a) the type and amount of information provided to them about their child leukaemia; (b) their sources of information; (c) their level of satisfaction from the information given; and (d) additional information they needed to manage the stressful encounters associated with the disease. Study results showed that health-care professionals represented the main source of information for these parents. The information given was centred primarily on the bio-medical aspects of the child condition. Parents, however, reported that they needed additional information related to the psychosocial ramifications of the situation. No statistically significant differences were found either between the two sexes or between the two spouses. Education and previous experience with cancer correlated both to perceived amount of information given and to parental satisfaction from it. Subjects' low satisfaction from the information offered to them seems to reflect their disappointment about (a) the limited effectiveness of current medical knowledge and treatment and (b) the bio-clinical focus of the Hellenic health-care system.\n",
      "One hundred and eighty-one consecutive patients with standard-risk leukaemia were transplanted with HLA-identical sibling grafts depleted of lymphocytes using counter-flow centrifugation. In 116 patients, standard conditioning was intensified by the addition of anthracyclines. Multivariate analysis revealed significantly more acute GVHD > or = grade 2 and a trend towards more chronic GVHD in patients conditioned with the addition of anthracyclines. For all patients the risk for chronic GVHD, but not for acute GVHD increased with a higher number of T cells in the graft. The projected 5-year probability of relapse was significantly lower in the group of patients conditioned with anthracyclines; 26% versus 52% (P = 0.015). In multivariate analysis the addition of anthracyclines to the conditioning regimen was the only significant factor contributing to a lower probability of relapse. The projected 5-year probability of leukaemia-free survival [LFS] in the patients conditioned with and without the addition of anthracyclines was 56% and 36%, respectively (P = 0.004). In multivariate analysis the addition of anthracyclines to the conditioning regimen correlated significantly with a lower number of mixed chimaeras in patients at 6 and 12 months after BMT. Mixed chimaerism at 6 months after transplantation did not significantly correlate with a higher incidence of relapse in further follow-up. In contrast, mixed chimaerism at 12 months after BMT was significantly associated with higher relapse rate. We conclude that the addition of anthracyclines to the conditioning regimen improves outcome of BMT using T-cell-depleted grafts.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The primary objective of the present study was to assess changes in the nutritional status and quality of life in acute leukaemia patients, aged ≥15 years, who had undergone induction chemotherapy. METHODS: A preliminary and post-induction chemotherapy assessment of patients' nutritional status, quality of life, sociodemographic status and medical characteristics was conducted using the Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life (QOL-C30, version 3) questionnaires. The PG-SGA is a clinical nutrition assessment tool used to evaluate oncology patients. Patients with newly-diagnosed acute leukaemia, aged ≥15 years, at three hospitals in Tehran (from May 2009 to March 2010), were recruited for the present study. RESULTS: Sixty-three acute leukaemia patients [65% men and 35% women with a mean (SD) age of 33 (15.4) years] participated in the present study. A total of 19.4% were found to be malnourished prior to chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, 76.1% of patients were considered moderately malnourished, whereas 6.3% were severely malnourished. After induction chemotherapy, both the nutritional status and quality of life deteriorated in the majority of patients, as demonstrated by a paired t-test. CONCLUSIONS: A deteriorated nutritional status and quality of life was the result of the side effects posed by induction chemotherapy in the patients investigated in the present study. These findings highlight the need for an appropriate nutritional support programme to improve the nutritional status and quality of life in patients with leukaemia undergoing chemotherapy.\n",
      "In order to better understand the molecular background of differences between the clinical picture of T- and B-lineage ALLs, we studied the expression of several proteins involved in the regulation of cell proliferation in bone marrow blast cells from 30 cases of previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL); 14 cases were T- and 16 B-cell lineage ALLs. We studied several cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk1, cdk2, cdk4, cdk6) and cyclins (cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin D3 and cyclin E). We also studied proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Bcl-2 expression, the latter protein known to be involved in the prolonged survival of B-lineage ALL blasts. Proteins obtained from cell lysates were resolved on polyacrylamide gel followed by immunodetection and densitometry of specific bands. Expression of cdk1 and PCNA, markers of proliferative activity, was significantly higher in T- than in B-lineage ALL. Cdk6, which was highly correlated to PCNA, was also higher in T-cell ALL. In contrast, B-lineage ALL displayed a higher expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. We hypothesize that those particularities may reflect differential roles of cell multiplication and apoptosis in the neoplastic proliferation of B- and T-lineage ALL.\n",
      "Thirty-five patients, 24 males and 11 females, with myelodysplastic syndromes were studied for the expression of c-myc encoded p67 oncoprotein. According to FAB classification, 5 patients had refractory anaemia (RA). 5 refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 17 refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), 4 refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t), and 4 chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). The mouse anti-human 9E10 derived monoclonal antibody in the standard APAAP technique for immunohistochemical analysis was used. A scoring method similar to that routinely used for endogenous neutrophil alkaline phosphatase estimation, was applied to obtain parametrically comparable results. In all but two MDS patients, the observed c-myc oncoprotein score values did not differ statistically from those found in the controls. The values did not correlate with peripheral blood or bone marrow blast cell numbers. In two out of 17 patients with RAEB in whom very high c-myc score values were found, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) was diagnosed 30 and 45 days later, respectively. Furthermore, we found high c-myc score values in three patients with RAEB and in two patients with RAEB-t during the ANLL phase which was diagnosed six to ten months after the initial study. Our data suggest that c-myc activation may be seen in all cases of MDS in overt ANLL phase, and also in some RAEB patients a few weeks before diagnosis of overt ANLL. The possible prognostic value of c-myc activation in MDS patients remains to be clarified.\n",
      "The biology of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the subject of much interest. We present a case of Ph+ ALL with a minor breakpoint cluster (mBCR) rearrangement who subsequently relapsed with Ph+ mBCR+ acute myeloid leukaemia and later with Ph+ mBCR+ acute stem cell leukaemia. This case provides further evidence that Ph+ ALL with a mBCR rearrangement may arise from a pluripotent stem cell with similar potential to that of chronic granulocytic leukaemia to undergo blastic crises with differing lineage characteristics.\n",
      "Human leukaemia cells have an often unique ability to either undergo apoptotic cell death mechanisms or, at other times, undergo proliferative expansion, sometimes to the same stimulus such as the pluripotent cytokine TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α). This potential for life/death switching helps us to understand the molecular signalling machinery that underlies these cellular processes. Furthermore, looking at the involvement of these switching signalling pathways that may be aberrant in leukaemia informs us of their importance in cancer tumorigenesis and how they may be targeted pharmacologically to treat various types of human leukaemias. Furthermore, these important pathways may play a crucial role in acquired chemotherapy resistance and should be studied further to overcome in the clinic many drug-resistant forms of blood cancers. In the present article, we uncover the relationship that exists in human leukaemia life/death switching between the anti-apoptotic pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) and the cytoprotective antioxidant-responsive transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2). We also discuss recent findings that reveal a major role for Btk (Bruton tyrosine kinase) in both lymphocytic and myeloid forms of human leukaemias and lymphomas.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the observed excess of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma near the Sellafield nuclear plant is associated with established risk factors or with factors related to the plant. DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTING: West Cumbria health district. SUBJECTS: 52 Cases of leukaemia, 22 of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 23 of Hodgkin disease occurring in people born in the area and diagnosed there in 1950-85 under the age of 25 and 1001 controls matched for sex and date of birth taken from the same birth registers as the cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antenatal abdominal x ray examinations, viral infections, habit factors, proximity to and employment characteristics of parents at Sellafield. RESULTS: Expected associations with prenatal exposure to x rays were found, but little information was available on viral illnesses. Relative risks for leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were higher in children born near Sellafield and in children of fathers employed at the plant, particularly those with high radiation dose recordings before their child conception. For example, the relative risks compared with area controls were 0.17 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.53) for being born further than 5 km from Sellafield 2.44 (1.04 to 5.71) for children of fathers employed at Sellafield at their conception, and 6.42 (1.57 to 26.3) for children of fathers receiving a total preconceptual ionising radiation dose of 100 mSv or more. Other factors, including exposure to x rays, maternal age, employment elsewhere, eating seafood, and playing on the beach did not explain these relationships. Focusing on Seascale, where the excess incidence has predominantly been reported, showed for the four out of five cases of leukaemia and one case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma whose fathers were employed at Sellafield and for whom dose information was obtained that the fathers of each case had higher radiation doses before their child conception than all their matched control fathers; the father of the other Seascale case (non-Hodgkin lymphoma) was not employed at the plant. These results seem to explain statistically the geographical association. For Hodgkin disease neither geographical nor employment associations with Sellafield were found. CONCLUSIONS: The raised incidence of leukaemia, particularly, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma among children near Sellafield was associated with paternal employment and recorded external dose of whole body penetrating radiation during work at the plant before conception. The association can explain statistically the observed geographical excess. This result suggests an effect of ionising radiation on fathers that may be leukaemogenic in their offspring, though other, less likely, explanations are possible. There are important potential implications for radiobiology and for protection of radiation workers and their children.\n",
      "This retrospective study was designed to review the relative frequency and prognostic significance of extramedullary infiltrates in children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The registration data and initial discharge summaries were reviewed for all children diagnosed with AML, and registered by the Dutch Childhood Leukaemia Study Group (DCLSG). Between 1972 and 1998, 477 children were diagnosed with AML. Of these patients, 120 (25.1%) had extramedullary leukaemia (EML) at diagnosis. Four categories of EML were found: skin, soft tissue or bone, gingival infiltration and central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Patients who presented with gingival infiltrates, were older than those without EML or those in the other EML subgroups, had a high initial WBC count and a high proportion of M4/M5 morphological variants. This type of presentation could indicate a special biological entity. Univariate analysis of prognostic factors in patients treated after 1985 with intensive protocols showed that initial WBC count and the presence of favourable cytogenetic findings were significant. The presence of EML at diagnosis had no significant effect on event-free survival. In a stepwise multiple regression analysis only favourable cytogenetic findings remained significant.\n",
      "The cytogenetic and clinical course of three patients allografted for Ph positive chronic myeloid leukaemia are reported. All patients had a peculiar pattern of relapse. Two out of three patients had donor marrow graft pretreated with monoclonal antibody for graft versus host prevention. The cytogenetic relapse was invariably associated with major morphological changes in the marrow indicating that these were also haematological relapses. However, no changes in the peripheral blood count were observed. When relapse occurred in these patients, Ph positive marrow metaphases and host red blood cells ranged from 75% to 100% of the total cell population: thereafter they spontaneously reverted to complete chimaerism. Therefore the presence of leukaemic cells even in considerable amount was not sufficient, per se, to prevail over normal marrow. In addition these observations indicate that relapse was not associated with elimination of the graft: while haemopoiesis was entirely of recipient origin the donor normal stem cells were present and vital although functionally silent. These data suggest that, although TBI remains the more effective tool for eradicating the majority of leukaemic cells, haemopoietic competition between host and donor marrow may have a major impact on leukaemic relapse.\n",
      "A 33-year-old man presented with hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow findings were consistent with Philadelphia-positive accelerated-phase chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL). Lymph node histology and immunhistochemistry were diagnostic of T lymphoblastic lymphoma. Molecular studies on lymph node DNA identified rearrangement within the major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr), indicating a common clonal origin of CGL and the T lymphoblastic lymphoma. We report the second case where extramedullary T lymphoblastic crisis was the presenting feature of CGL.\n",
      "Spontaneous remission of adult acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) represents a rare event. We report a 60-year-old female patient suffering from secondary AML M1 and severe invasive pulmonary hyalohyphomycosis highly suggestive of aspergillosis. Two months after the diagnosis of leukaemia, she achieved a spontaneous remission lasting 3 months, although neither cytostatic drugs nor corticoids were administered because of a septic condition. At the time of remission, a chronic hepatitis C virus infection and a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia were present, and the patient received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor once. This report represents the first documentation of a spontaneous remission in AML following invasive pulmonary hyalohyphomycosis. Possible mechanisms of this phenomenon are discussed.\n",
      "Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening emergency that has to be promptly recognised. We report the case of a young adult patient with an acute cardiac tamponade as a rare presenting symptom of T-cell acute leukaemia. An emergency pericardiocentesis was performed with immediate relief of the symptoms. The aetiology was diagnosed on the basis of the serological hyperleucocytosis and the anatomopathological analysis of the pericardial fluid. The patient was subsequently referred for chemotherapy. Acute leukaemia presenting with pericardial tamponade as a first sign is rare, and described only in a few case reports. Furthermore, we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic measures of haemodynamic unstable cardiac tamponade.\n",
      "A 40 year old man presented with abdominal pain, jaundice, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly. Liver function tests revealed cholestatic jaundice and a computed tomography scan showed an enlarged liver, with a normal biliary tree. Liver biopsy showed diffuse infiltration by neutrophils, monocytoid cells, and blasts. Peripheral blood film and bone marrow were consistent with acute myeloid leukaemia. After treatment with chemotherapy using an acute myeloid leukaemia protocol (UK Medical Research Council AML-12), there was complete resolution of jaundice and the patient went into complete molecular remission.\n",
      "Invasive fungal infections (IFI) lead to morbidity and mortality in neutropenic patients and in allogenic stem cell transplantation. Serum-based fungal detection assays have limitation of specificity or sensitivity. Studies on fungal DNA detection using real-time PCR in childhood leukaemia are lacking. The aim of this study was to develop sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for IFI in paediatric acute leukaemia patients using real-time PCR. Of 100 randomised paediatric acute leukaemia patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole/amphotericin B, single peripheral whole blood sample in EDTA was used for Pan-AC real-time PCR assay (detects nine Candida and six Aspergillus species) in patients who failed prophylaxis due to proven, probable, possible or suspected fungal infections. PCR results were retrospectively correlated with clinical profile. Real-time PCR test was positive in 18/29 (62%) patients who failed prophylaxis. The only patient with proven IFI (mucormycosis), real-time PCR assay was negative. Real-time PCR was positive in 2/4 (50%) patients with possible and 16/24 (66.6%) suspected IFI and 5/10 (50%) patients with pneumonia. By applying method A/B, sensitivity and positive predictive value could not be commented due to unproven Aspergillus or Candida infections; specificity and negative predictive values (NPV) were 41% and 100% respectively; by method C (included episodes of possible IFI as true positive), sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 50%, 36%, 11% and 81% respectively. In those with suspected IFI, 8/24 (33.3%) were PCR negative and unnecessarily received empirical antifungal therapy (EAFT). Real-time PCR is a practical, rapid, non-invasive screening test for excluding IFI in paediatric leukaemia. The high NPV makes real-time PCR a promising tool to use this prior to initiating EAFT in antibiotic-resistant febrile neutropenic patients; this would avoid toxicity, cost and hospitalisation for EAFT (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT00624143).\n",
      "Hypereosinophilic syndromes may result either from eosinophilic differentiation of a clone of neoplastic cells or from reactive eosinophilia. In other patients HES is idiopathic. It appears likely that in many patients the \"idiopathic' hypereosinophilic syndrome is actually a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. Those cases showing an increase of blast cells or a demonstrable clonal cytogenetic abnormality should be classified as eosinophilic leukaemia. In other cases the neoplastic nature of the disease can be recognized only in retrospect when a granulocytic sarcoma or AMI, develops. A few cases of idiopathic HES are consequent on cytokine secretion whereas others remain idiopathic at the time of death. When eosinophilia occurs as a feature of an acute or chronic myeloid leukaemia or a chronic myeloproliferative disorder the eosinophils are usually part of the leukaemic clone. However, eosinophilia in association with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is usually reactive. Rare cases have a biphenotypic leukaemia/lymphoma with both eosinophils and lymphoid cells arising from a mutant pluripotent stem cell.\n",
      "More than half of the patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are older than 60years. The treatment outcomes in this group remain poor with a median overall survival of <1year. Selecting initial treatment for these patients involves an assessment of 'fitness' for induction chemotherapy. This is done based on patient and disease-related characteristics which help to estimate treatment-related mortality and chance of complete remission with induction chemotherapy. If the risk of treatment-related mortality is high and/or the likelihood of a patient achieving a complete remission is low, lower-intensity treatment (low-dose cytarabine, decitabine and azacitidine) should be discussed. As outcomes in both groups of patients remain poor, enrolment into clinical trials of novel agents with varying mechanisms of action should be considered for all older adults with AML. Novel agents in Phase III development include CPX-351, guadecitabine (SGI-110), quizartinib, crenolanib, sapacitabine, vosaroxin and volasertib.\n",
      "The Hungarian Childhood Cancer Registry, a population-based national registry of the Hungarian Paediatric Haemato-Oncology Network founded in 1971, monitors the incidence and mortality of childhood cancer. Our aims were to carry out a longitudinal study to investigate the trends and spatial inequalities of incidence and survival of leukaemia, and the association between survival and deprivation in Hungary. All cases of childhood leukaemia and myelodysplasia were analysed (3157 cases, 1971-2015, age: 0-14 years). Time trends and the annual percentage change in direct standardized incidence and mortality were assessed. Survival and association with deprivation were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. Incidence rates of leukaemia (23.5-56.0/million) increased with an average annual percent change (AAPC) of 1%, determined by an increase in the incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (14.6-39.2/million, AAPC: 1.25%). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant improvement in overall survival over the study period. Starting from 25% of cases surviving 5 years in the 70s; the overall 5-year survival reached 80% by 2010. Survival differences were observed with sex, leukaemia type and age at diagnosis. A reverse association was found in the survival probability of leukaemia by degree of deprivation. The Cox proportional hazards model verified a significant reverse association with deprivation [hazard ratio=1.08 (1.04-1.12)]. This is the first nationwide study to confirm the prognostic role of deprivation on the basis of a large cohort of patients with childhood leukaemia during a 45-year period. To maintain further improvement in treatment results, it is important to detect inequalities. Our results showed that deprivation may also be important in the survival of leukaemia.\n",
      "There is an ongoing scientific controversy whether the observed association between exposure to residential extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) and the risk of childhood leukaemia observed in epidemiological studies is causal or due to methodological shortcomings of those studies. Recent pooled analysis confirm results from previous studies, namely an approximately two-fold risk increase at ELF-MF exposures ≥0.4 μT, and demonstrate consistency of studies across countries, with different design, different methods of exposure assessment, and different systems of power transmission and distribution. On the other hand, recent pooled analyses for childhood brain tumour show little evidence for an association with ELF-MF, also at exposures ≥0.4 μT. Overall, the assessment that ELF-MF are a possible carcinogen and may cause childhood leukaemia remains valid. Ongoing research activities, mainly experimental and few new epidemiological studies, hopefully provide additional insight to bring clarity to a research area that has remained inconclusive.\n",
      "Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is a unique clinicobiologic entity that can be successfully treated with All-trans Retinoic Acid ATRA-based regimens. Some cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with nucleophosmin (NPM) mutations have an immunophenotype that is similar to APL. The objective of the study is to compare antigenic expression in a group of APL patients with that in AML patients with NPM mutations and an APL-like immunophenotype (CD15- CD34- HLA-DR-). A consecutive series of 40 APL and 12 NPM patients with an APL-like phenotype were included in the study. Immunophenotypic patterns were investigated by multiparametric flow cytometry. Promyelocytic leukaemia-retinoic acid receptor-α transcript type, NPM and FLT3 mutations were investigated using conventional methods. Statistically significant differences were found between APL and NPM-mutated AML in CD33, CD13, CD2 and CD110 reactivity. CD2 expression was absent in every patient with NPM-mutated AML. In addition, mean fluorescence intensity and the coefficient of variation (cv) of CD33 and CD13 showed statistical differences between the two groups for CD33 (p = 0.007) and a trend to significance for CD13 (p = 0.05). Furthermore, among 45 evaluable patients, CD110 expression statistically differentiates between the two groups: [2/33 (6%) in the APL group and 8/12 (66.6%) in the NPM-mutated AML (p = 0.014)]. However, these traits were subtle, raising the possibility of practical diagnostic challenges. In conclusion, CD110 and CD33 reactivity may be useful to distinguish APL from NPM-mutated AML with CD15, CD34 and HLA-DR negativity. Nevertheless, cytogenetic and molecular characterization is necessary to establish the accurate diagnosis of AML.\n",
      "The cell of origin and triggering events for leukaemia are mostly unknown. Here we show that the bone marrow contains a progenitor that expresses renin throughout development and possesses a B-lymphocyte pedigree. This cell requires RBP-J to differentiate. Deletion of RBP-J in these renin-expressing progenitors enriches the precursor B-cell gene programme and constrains lymphocyte differentiation, facilitated by H3K4me3 activating marks in genes that control the pre-B stage. Mutant cells undergo neoplastic transformation, and mice develop a highly penetrant B-cell leukaemia with multi-organ infiltration and early death. These renin-expressing cells appear uniquely vulnerable as other conditional models of RBP-J deletion do not result in leukaemia. The discovery of these unique renin progenitors in the bone marrow and the model of leukaemia described herein may enhance our understanding of normal and neoplastic haematopoiesis.\n",
      "Hairy cell leukaemia is a rare chronic lymphoproliferative disease, characterized by splenomegaly, pancytopenia and recurrent infection. The characteristic 'hairy cells', present in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, are the hallmark of this leukaemia. The disease has a chronic, progressive course, and the majority of patients afflicted by it require therapy. The most common reason to initiate treatment is neutropenia with or without associated infectious complications, or the development of severe thrombocytopenia. Therapeutic options in hairy cell leukaemia include splenectomy, interferon administration, or the use of chemotherapeutic agents such as pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. Splenectomy is still indicated in the treatment of young patients with significant splenomegaly and only minimal bone marrow involvement. Interferon treatment induces remission in approximately 90% of patients with hairy cell leukaemia, but complete remission is obtained in only 5-10%. The development of antibodies against interferon was initially considered a major problem, but longer follow-up of patients who developed antibodies has shown that it is transient and does not have a significant impact on the overall response to treatment. Pentostatin induces complete remission in 60-70% of patients and partial remission in 20-40%. 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine is a very promising drug in the treatment of this rare leukaemia, inducing long-lasting complete remission in approximately 80% of patients. While interferon does not cure the disease, it is possible that a subset of patients treated with pentostatin or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine are cured. Longer follow-up of these patients will determine whether this is true.\n",
      "Cytogenetically-defined subgroups of acute myeloid leukaemia have distinct biologies, clinical features and outcomes. Evidence from therapy-related leukaemia suggests that chromosomal abnormalities are also markers of exposure. Our results suggest that the smoking-associated risk for acute myeloid leukaemia is restricted to the t(8;21)(q22;q22) subgroup. This supports the hypothesis that distinct cytogenetic subgroups of acute myeloid leukaemia have separate aetiologies.\n",
      "We report a 47-year-old man with oligoblastic leukaemia (8;21) translocation, phenomenon of cannibalism by granulocytic cells and haemophagocytic syndrome. The patient responded to intensive chemotherapy with disappearance of haemophagocytosis, granulocytic and histiocytic. We conclude that: (1) granulocytic cannibalism and haemophagocytic syndrome can be unusual myelodysplastic features; (2) the oligoblastic leukaemia with presence of cytogenetic abnormalities related to AML in young patients are probably more close to acute leukaemia than to myelodysplastic syndrome.\n",
      "Acute phase proteins (APP) are regarded as a useful diagnostic tool in humans with lymphomas, leukaemias and multiple myeloma. C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin concentrations were measured in dogs with malignant multicentric (high grade) lymphoma (n=16), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n=11), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (n=7) and multiple myeloma (n=8). Twenty-five healthy dogs served as controls. Measurements of the CRP plasma concentration were performed using a commercial ELISA and haptoglobin was measured with an assay based on its haemoglobin binding capacity. Global group comparisons using Kruskal-Wallis-test revealed significant group differences for both APPs (P<0.0001). Median CRP concentrations were increased in all groups with neoplastic lymphatic disorders (lymphoma: 37.2mg/L, ALL: 47.8mg/L, CLL: 35.5mg/L, myeloma: 17.6mg/L) compared to controls (1.67mg/L; P<0.001). Compared to the healthy controls (median=0.59g/L), haptoglobin was especially increased in dogs with ALL (6.8g/L, P<0.0001) followed by dogs with malignant lymphoma (3.8g/L, P<0.0001), CLL (3.2g/L, P=0.0008), and multiple myeloma (3.0g/L, P=0.0163). For both APPs, a wide range of values was found in all patient groups. The results indicate that particularly severe and acute lymphatic neoplasia, such as high grade lymphoma and ALL, cause significant acute phase reactions in dogs and must be included in the differential diagnoses of increased blood levels of these APPs.\n",
      "Co(III)-cyclen complexes are known to cause DNA strand breaks by hydrolytically cleaving the phosphodiester backbone via a mechanism that does not require oxidation. Here, we report the first cytotoxicity study of [Co(III)(cyclen)Cl(2)]Cl (2), the parental example of this class of agent, which reveals that (2) is selectively toxic towards CCRF-CEM (IC(50)=32+/-10 microM), THP-1 (IC(50)=110+/-40 microM), and HL-60 (IC(50)=70+/-35 microM) human leukaemia cells, compared to human skin and lung fibroblasts (IC(50)>10 mM). Investigations of its effect on CCRF-CEM cells show it kills by apoptosis which was characterised by microscopy, flow cytometry, and in vitro NMR experiments. The latter involved measurement of the ratio of methylene and methyl (1)H resonances at 1.3 and 0.9 ppm, respectively, associated with the externalisation of membrane bound phosphatidyl serine. The NMR data indicate increasing lactate production during apoptosis, which implies involvement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, a notion supported by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax levels as detected by Western blotting.\n",
      "In the past few years, research in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has led to remarkable advances in our understanding of the disease. Cytogenetic and molecular aberrations are the most important factors in determining response to chemotherapy as well as long-term outcome, but beyond prognostication are potential therapeutic targets. Our increased understanding of the pathogenesis of AML, facilitated by next-generation sequencing, has spurred the development of new compounds in the treatment of AML, particularly the creation of small molecules that target the disease on a molecular level. Various new agents, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal or bispecific T-cell engager antibodies, metabolic and pro-apoptotic agents are currently investigated within clinical trials. The highest response rates are often achieved when new molecularly targeted therapies are combined with standard chemotherapy. Presented here is an overview of novel therapies currently being evaluated in AML.\n",
      "Bone marrow aspirates and biopsy specimens were taken at diagnosis from 51 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The diagnosis was based on morphological and cytochemical analyses, and the leukaemias were classified by FAB criteria. A considerable difference was observed between the results of bone marrow aspirates and the findings of plastic-embedded bone marrow biopsy specimens, particularly in marrow cellularity, extent of blast cell infiltration, and cell type involved in the leukaemic process. The myelomonocytic cell type seemed to predominate in the sections. In four cases there was considerable marrow infiltration with maturing, but dysplastic, granulocytic cells in the sections, but not in the aspirate smears. Features of potential prognostic importance, such as bone marrow infiltration with inflammatory cells, were easily recognised and quantified in the sections. These results indicate that plastic embedded bone marrow biopsy sections complement the findings of bone marrow aspiration in the diagnosis of AML and may also provide information of independent prognostic importance that cannot be obtained by other means.\n",
      "An emerging approach for treating cancer involves programming patient-derived T cells with genes encoding disease-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), so that they can combat tumour cells once they are reinfused. Although trials of this therapy have produced impressive results, the in vitro methods they require to generate large numbers of tumour-specific T cells are too elaborate for widespread application to treat cancer patients. Here, we describe a method to quickly program circulating T cells with tumour-recognizing capabilities, thus avoiding these complications. Specifically, we demonstrate that DNA-carrying nanoparticles can efficiently introduce leukaemia-targeting CAR genes into T-cell nuclei, thereby bringing about long-term disease remission. These polymer nanoparticles are easy to manufacture in a stable form, which simplifies storage and reduces cost. Our technology may therefore provide a practical, broadly applicable treatment that can generate anti-tumour immunity 'on demand' for oncologists in a variety of settings.\n",
      "The choice of primary treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia diagnosed in chronic phase has become exceedingly difficult. There is little doubt that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can eradicate the leukaemia and that a 'graft-versus-leukaemia' effect makes a major contribution to this result; conversely only a minority of patients are eligible for transplant, which still carries an appreciable risk of mortality or protracted morbidity. For the majority of patients interferon-alpha prolongs life to some degree in comparison with hydroxyurea but is associated with considerable toxicity. The newly introduced tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib, Glivec) induces complete haematologic remission in almost all cases and is associated with a very high incidence of cytogenetic response; its capacity to prolong life in comparison with interferon-alpha is not yet established. Here we review some factors that predict survival after non-transplant therapy and after allografting for CML in chronic phase. We consider two contrasting options for managing the newly diagnosed patient and conclude that for the present allogeneic stem cell transplantation soon after diagnosis should continue to be offered as an option for selected patients. Further experience with the use of imatinib as a single agent or in combination with other anti-leukemic agents may alter the picture in the near future.\n",
      "As part of a more comprehensive study, complete residential histories were collected from 109 cases of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma who were diagnosed while resident in Gateshead, West Cumbria or North Humberside (1973-1987), and who were born in the same areas. Corresponding data were obtained from the same number of controls matched by date of birth, sex and area of residence at diagnosis and birth. Altogether, 1332 years of residential history were available for analysis and of these 131 (9.8 per cent) included a change of home. Moving house was much more frequent for both cases and controls in the first two years of life (69 out of 432 child-years, i.e. 16 per cent). The moves were mostly over short distances, with only 23 per cent being 5 km or more and only 9 per cent into another administrative district. Twenty-eight per cent of the children had moved house at least once by their second birthday and 48 per cent by the age of five years. Few case-control differences were apparent and none achieved statistical significance. There was a suggestion of more mobility for case children in the first few years of life, especially for cases diagnosed shortly after the removal. When the residence of mothers in the year preceding the childrens' birth was examined, there were relatively few removals in this period (26, i.e. 24 per cent, altogether, of which 14 were over 5 km and nine from another administrative district). Of these, 18 case mothers had moved (11 over 5 km) compared with eight control mothers (three over 5 km).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "A representative sample of the pet cat population of the United Kingdom was surveyed. Blood samples from 1204 sick and 1007 healthy cats of known breed, age and sex were tested for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). The prevalence of FIV was 19 per cent in sick cats and 6 per cent in healthy cats, and the prevalence of FeLV was 18 per cent in sick cats and 5 per cent in healthy cats; both infections were more common in domestic cats than in pedigree cats. Feline immunodeficiency virus was more prevalent in older cats but FeLV was more prevalent in younger cats. There was no difference between the prevalence of FeLV in male and female cats but male cats were more likely to be infected with FIV than female cats. No interaction was demonstrated between FIV and FeLV infections. Of the cats which were in contact with FIV in households with more than one cat, 21 per cent had seroconverted. The prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats in contact with FeLV was 14 per cent. The clinical signs associated with FIV were pyrexia, gingivitis/stomatitis and respiratory signs, and with FeLV, pyrexia and anaemia. It was concluded that both viruses were significant causes of disease, and that the cats most likely to be infected with FIV were older, free-roaming male cats and for FeLV, younger, free-roaming cats.\n",
      "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and the mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) are rare haematopoietic stem cell diseases in children. While MDS-initiating events remain largely obscure, a growing body of clinical, genetic and laboratory evidence suggests that JMML is, at least in part, caused by aberrant signal transduction resulting from mutations of components of the RAS signalling pathway. To date, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation cures more than half of children diagnosed with MDS or JMML. Research on genetic conditions predisposing to MDS in young age, such as inherited syndromes with bone marrow failure, may present important insights into MDS pathogenesis.\n",
      "Two familial cases of hairy cell leukaemia are reported: a daughter, 44-years-old, with a very unusual ultrastructural pattern found in hairy cells, the \"tubuloreticular inclusions\", and her mother, 71-years-old, who was affected six years later. Routine laboratory investigations, cytochemical and cytogenetic studies including HLA typing, as well as in vitro proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to polyclonal mitogens and to exogenous interleukin 2, were performed. The immunological characterization by assessing the cell surface phenotypic markers with monoclonal antibodies and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations were also carried out. In case 2 all tests were performed both on PBMC and on the bone marrow cells. To the best of our knowledge this is one of the first reports of such familial association. The possibility that genetic factors might play a role in the etiology of leukaemia in man is discussed: in our two cases, however, cytogenetic studies did not support this, while HLA typing revealed a non-significant association of HCL with DQw3 allele. Alternatively, an environmental factor has been considered, and a viral infection-perhaps by a retrovirus of the HTLV family has been suggested as tubuloreticular inclusions have been found in both hairy cell leukaemia, as reported, by us, and AIDS-LAS. However, a long time elapsed between the manifestation of HCL in the daughter and in the mother, and as the two patients had not been living together at that time, the possibility of a viral transmission seems minimal. The results of TEM and of immunological investigations are presented and discussed. Both, but particularly the latter, support the B cell nature of the hairy cell.\n",
      "The clinical presentation of acute myeloid leukaemia is variable. We report a 40-year-old woman who presented with a 1-month history of galactorrhoea with an elevated prolactin level. The blood counts were normal, but she was found to have acute myeloid leukaemia with monocytic differentiation. The serum prolactin level normalized after chemotherapy. In the absence of evidence of CNS involvement, the hyperprolactinaemia is presumed to be a paraneoplastic phenomenon. We discuss the potential mechanism of prolactin production in this case.\n",
      "We recently reported that virtually all children with acute leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who develop the phenotype of increasing mixed chimaerism (MC) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) will relapse. We therefore performed a prospective, multi-centre study focused on children with MDS (n = 65; advanced MDS = 44, refractory cytopenia = 21) after allo-SCT in order to determine to what extent relapse can be prevented by pre-emptive immunotherapy on the basis of increasing MC. Analyses of chimaerism in 44 patients with advanced MDS revealed 31 cases with complete chimaerism (CC)/low-level MC/transient MC, 11 cases with increasing MC and two cases with decreasing MC. The same analyses in 21 MDS patients with refractory cytopenia revealed 17 cases with CC/low-level MC, one case with increasing MC and three cases with decreasing MC. Pre-emptive immunotherapy performed on each patient that showed increasing MC improved event-free survival from 0%, as seen in prior studies, to 50%. We therefore conclude that pre-emptive immunotherapy is an effective treatment option to prevent impending relapse in children with MDS after allo-SCT.\n",
      "A 10-week-old Thoroughbred filly was referred for anaemia of 4 weeks' duration. Haematology revealed severe anaemia and panleucopenia. Cytological examination of bone marrow smears revealed a myeloid to erythroid ratio <0.02:1 (reference range 0.5-2.4:1.0) and an abundance of erythroid precursor cells. The erythroid cell population included rubriblasts, prorubricytes and rubricytes, with only scant numbers of metarubricytes present. There were numerous mitotic erythroid cells, some of which were atypical and megaloblastic. These cytomorphological changes are consistent with pure acute erythroid leukaemia. No treatment was instituted and the filly died three days after presentation. This case illustrates the need to consider both haematology and bone marrow findings to establish a diagnosis of pure erythroid leukaemia. To our knowledge, there is no documented case of acute myeloproliferative disease in horses involving cells of erythroid lineage, but this condition should be considered a differential diagnosis for horses presenting with anaemia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a new formulation of live attenuated varicella vaccine (Oka strain) in non-immune household contacts of children with cancer or leukaemia. METHODOLOGY: This was an open study with one group. Healthy varicella-susceptible adults and children living in the same household as children with cancer or leukaemia were vaccinated with a new live attenuated varicella vaccine (Oka strain) which is stable when stored at 2-8 degrees C (refrigerator temperature) for at least 24 months (Varilrix). Children less than 13 years of age received one dose (0.5 mL containing at least 103.3 plaque forming units) by subcutaneous injection and those aged over 13 years received two doses 8 weeks apart. Adverse reactions following vaccination were recorded daily by the vaccinees. Post-vaccination antibody estimation was determined using indirect immunofluorescence 6 weeks after vaccination. RESULTS: Thirty-five seronegative subjects (28 children and 7 adults and adolescents) were vaccinated. All subjects tested (34) had seroconverted after vaccination. Local injection site reactions were experienced by 15/35. Other adverse reactions were uncommon (rash 2/35, fever (>/= 37.5 degrees C) 3/35). No cases of clinical varicella occurred amongst the high-risk household contacts of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: This is the first study of this formulation of varicella vaccine in household contacts of children with cancer or leukaemia. The vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic, but further follow-up is needed to document duration of immunity.\n",
      "Allogeneic hematopoietic SCT is indicated for children whose disease demonstrates dismal prognosis with chemotherapy. This study aims to analyse the most recent outcomes of unmanipulated haploidentical (HID) HSCT for paediatric patients with acute leukaemia. Those from matched sibling donors (MSD) HSCT provided a parallel cohort to illustrate the benefits of HID. Conditioning regimen was modified BuCy2. Anti-thymoglobulin was used for HID. Mobilised marrow and blood stem cells were used as the grafts. All patients in HID achieved neutrophil recovery and 96.7% platelet recovery. In HID, the incidences of acute GVHD 3-4 and extensive chronic GVHD were 14.3 and 26.6%. Play-performance score 90-100% was recorded in 79.7% of all survivors. The 5-year leukaemia-free survival (LFS) in CR1, CR2, beyond CR2 or non-remission were 68.9%, 56.6%, 22.2% and 82.5%, 59.4%, 42.9% for ALL and AML, respectively. In MSD group, LFS for ALL and AML in CR1 were 62.5 and 71.7%. Outcomes of the HID HSCT for paediatric patients with acute leukaemia showed benefits that were similar to those of the parallel cohort of MSD HSCT.\n",
      "Invasive fungal infections are a major cause for morbidity and mortality in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Long duration of hospitalization and increased costs are secondary burdens for patients and caregivers. The clinical manifestations are variable with a spectrum of different organs or systems. Factors related with invasive fungal infections may be categorized as host-related including the underlying disease, treatment and colonization status and pathogen-related including the capacity of the microorganism for defence, growth, tolerance and tissue affinity. The diagnosis of invasive fungal infection is confirmed with histopathological or microbiological demonstration of the microorganism, and commonly treatments are based on probability rather than definitive diagnosis due to patients fragile conditions preventing interventions. We aimed to present the less frequent yet difficult-to-treat organism, Verticillium causing invasive fungal infection in a patient with AML undergoing remission induction therapy.\n",
      "Auer rods are cytoplasmic inclusions found only in the leukaemic cells of some cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The ultrastructure of Auer rods is different in different sub-types of the disease and it is suggested here that this may be a consequence of the Auer rods consisting of different crystalline forms of the enzyme myeloperoxidase. There is statistical evidence to indicate that patients with Auer rods have a more favourable prognosis than those without. It is proposed that an investigation of the factors that determine the form, if any, of the crystallisation of myeloperoxidase will lead to a better understanding of the molecular events underlying the different types of AML. In the long term this may in turn lead to a therapeutic advance.\n",
      "The incidence of childhood leukaemia in The Netherlands in the period 1973-1986 was studied by means of the DCLSG nationwide register, which lists all patients according to bone marrow slides classified in the DCLSG central laboratory. Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) accounted for 81% of cases, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) for 13%, chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) for 2.5%, and acute unclassifiable leukaemia (AUL) for 3%. The peak incidence of ALL was at age 3, common-ALL and pre B-ALL comprising about 95% of the immunophenotypes at this age. Incidence rates for ALL remained stable between 1973 and 1978 at 2.85 cases per 10(5) children per year, exhibited a temporary increase between 1979 and 1984 to 3.60 and dropped back to the lower, previous level in 1985 and 1986. This rise was seen mainly among children in the 1-4 year age group, especially at age 3, and those with common-ALL and an initial WBC less than 5.0 x 10(9) l-1. Cumulative incidence rates per year of birth were fairly homogeneous up to age 6, except for the 1978 birth cohort which exhibited higher rates. Incidence rates for ANLL, CML and AUL remained stable over time. Changes in ascertainment, declining birth rates and a 50% decrease in childhood mortality, e.g. from infectious diseases, could not explain this temporary variation. Moreover, incidence rates in this survey appeared to be similar to those reported in various developed countries for the same period. As far as the aetiology of childhood common-ALL is concerned, therefore, the Dutch data appear to support the hypothesis of 'random mutation' as well as that of a limited role of environmental factors.\n",
      "AIMS: Germline mutation of NF2 gene is a feature of neurofibromatosis type 2 familial cancer syndrome. Also, somatic point mutations of NF2 mutation have been reported in tumours originated from nerve structures. A recent study revealed that NF2 gene was mutated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as well, suggesting a possibility that NF2 gene might be somatically mutated in other human cancers. The aim of this study was to explore whether NF2 genes are somatically mutated, and contribute to tumorigenesis in common human cancers. METHODS: For this, we analysed the entire coding region of NF2 gene in 45 colorectal carcinomas, 45 gastric, 45 breast, 45 lung, 45 hepatocellular (HCC), 45 prostate carcinomas, and 45 acute leukaemias by a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. RESULTS: Overall, we found NF2 mutations in one HCC (1/45; 2.2%) (hepatitis B virus-related HCC), one lung carcinoma (1/45; 2.2%) (squamous cell carcinoma), and one acute leukaemia (1/45; 2.2%) (acute myelogenous leukaemia minimally differentiated). All of the mutations were missense mutations that would substitute amino acids in the NF2 protein (p.A238 V, p.A451T and p.R467K). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that somatic mutation of NF2 gene is not prevalent in common human cancers, and its mutation somatically occurs in a minor fraction of HCC, lung cancer and acute leukaemia. These data suggest that somatic mutation of NF2 tumour suppressor gene may not play a central role in development of common cancers.\n",
      "Philadelphia (Ph+) positive leukaemias are an example of haematological malignant diseases where different chromosomal rearrangements involving both BCR and ABL1 genes generate a variety of chimeric proteins (BCR/ABL1 p210, p190 and p230) which are considered pathological \"biomarkers\". In addition to these three, there is a variety of fusion transcripts whose origin may depend either on diverse genetic rearrangement or on alternative/atypical splicing of the main mRNAs or on the occurrence of single-point mutations. Although the therapy of Ph+ leukaemias based on Imatinib represents a triumph of medicine, not all patients benefit from such drug and may show resistance and intolerance. Furthermore, interruption of Imatinib administration is often followed by clinical relapse, suggesting a failure in the eradication of residual leukaemic stem cells. Therefore, while the targeted therapy is searching for new and implemented pharmacological inhibitors covering all the possible mutations in the kinase domain, there is urge to identify alternative molecular targets to develop other specific and effective therapeutic approaches. In this review we discuss the importance of recent advances based on the discovery of novel BCR/ABL1 variants and their potential role as new targets/biomarkers of Ph+ leukaemias in the light of the current therapeutic trends. The limits of the pharmacological inhibitors used for treating the disease can be overcome by considering other targets than the kinase enzyme. Our evaluations highlight the potential of alternative perspectives in the therapy of Ph+ leukaemias.\n",
      "NOTCH activation plays oncogenic roles in acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). However, whether NOTCH is oncogenic or tumor-suppressive in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is still controversial. Herein, the roles of NOTCH in AML are reviewed. AML cells express NOTCH and NOTCH ligands; however, cell-autonomous activation is not observed. Activating NOTCH1 mutations are rare in AML, unlike in T-ALL. NOTCH ligand stimulation generally suppresses the in vitro growth of AML cells but promotes transient growth of some samples. Conversely, knockdown of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 does not affect the growth of AML cells, whereas it suppresses the growth of T-ALL cells. These findings suggest that NOTCH is dispensable or suppressive for AML cell growth. However, the effects of NOTCH differ depending on cell conditions, and various stemness-related signals modify these effects; hence, forced NOTCH activation in vitro may not exhibit effects in bone marrow. Thus, further understanding is required for the development of AML therapies targeting NOTCH signalling.\n",
      "AIMS: Classic erythroleukaemia (acute myeloid leukaemia M6, or M6 AML) is defined as an excess of myeloblasts in an erythroid predominant background. Leukaemia variants in which the primitive blast cells are demonstrably erythroid are extremely rare and poorly characterised. Variably referred to as \"true erythroleukaemia\" or \"acute erythremic myelosis\", they are often included within the M6 AML category even though they do not meet strict criteria for this type of AML. METHODS: Two cases of acute erythroid neoplasia are presented with clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Both patients presented with profound anaemia, one in a setting of long standing myelodysplasia. Bone marrow examination revealed a predominant population of highly dysplastic erythroid cells in both cases. In one case, the liver was infiltrated by neoplastic erythroid cells. Both patients died within four months of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This report illustrates that cases of acute leukaemia occur in which the dominant neoplastic cell is a primitive erythroid cell without an accompanying increase in myeloblasts. This does not preclude the neoplastic clone originating in a multipotent haemopoietic stem cell, as suggested by cases arising in patients with myelodysplasia. Acute erythremic myelosis should be recognised as a distinct variant of M6 AML.\n",
      "2-methyl-naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione (FNQ3), a synthetic analogue of the quinone kigelinone, has demonstrated a real potential for use in the treatment of a variety of solid tumours. Unlike other quinones, such as mitomycin-C and adriamycin, the cytotoxicity of FNQ3 is often 10- to 14-fold more potent towards the tumour cells than their normal counterparts. We report, for the first time, that the drug had activity against a broad spectrum of leukaemias and multiple myeloma cells. It decreased the growth of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and multiple myeloma cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion (50% inhibitory concentration approximately 1.25 microg/ml against most of the leukaemia cell lines). This dose apparently initiated mitochondrial collapse as measured by depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane. FNQ3 potentiated the differentiation of HL-60 myeloid cells in the presence of either 1alpha, 25(OH)(2) dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)] or all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). FNQ3 inhibited the proliferation of primary AML cells while inducing apoptosis. Eleven of 14 (79%) AML marrow samples had a prominent decrease in their clonogenic growth when cultured in the presence of the drug. In summary, this drug has growth inhibitory, apoptotic and differentiative effects against myeloid leukaemias and multiple myeloma cells. FNQ3 may represent a new therapeutic approach to these malignancies.\n",
      "Many typescripts in this issue describe increasing use of HLA-haplotype-matched transplants in persons with leukaemia and report outcomes. Consequently, my goal is not to repeat these data but to focus on controversies and challenges relevant to this topic including: (1) what is the best technique for performing these transplants; (2) who is the best donor; (3) who should receive this type of transplant; (4) how do results compare with transplants from other donors; and (5) how can results be improved.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that childhood leukaemia can be associated with residential traffic exposure; nevertheless, more results are needed to support this conclusion. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the possible effects of residential proximity to road traffic on childhood leukaemia, taking into account traffic density, road proximity and the type of leukaemia (acute lymphoid leukaemia or acute myeloid leukaemia). METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of childhood leukaemia in Spain, covering the period 1990-2011. It included 1061 incidence cases gathered from the Spanish National Childhood Cancer Registry and those Autonomous Regions with 100% coverage, and 6447 controls, individually matched by year of birth, sex and autonomous region of residence. Distances were computed from the respective participant residential locations to the different types of roads and four different buffers. Using logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs), were calculated for four different categories of distance to roads. RESULTS: Cases of childhood leukaemia had more than three-fold increased odds of living at <50 m of the busiest motorways compared to controls (OR = 2.90; 95%CI = 1.30-6.49). The estimates for acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) were slightly higher (OR = 2.95; 95%CI = 1.22-7.14), while estimates for cases with the same address at birth and at diagnosis were lower (OR = 2.40; 95%CI = 0.70-8.30). CONCLUSIONS: Our study agrees with the literature and furnishes some evidence that living near a busy motorway could be a risk factor for childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "Between August 1985 and October 1987 we treated 35 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) by high dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation (TBI) (1000 or 1200 cGy, n = 31) and total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) (800 or 600 cGy, n = 35) preceding allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Both TBI and TLI were given at 200 cGy/fraction. Twenty-three patients had HLA-identical sibling donors, nine patients had HLA-matched but unrelated donors, and three partially HLA-mismatched donors. Twenty-two patients received T-cell depleted marrow. The addition of TLI to the standard protocol did not add greatly to the toxicity. Four patients had recurrent leukaemia before engraftment was evaluable. The other 31 patients engrafted and no graft failed. Twenty-two patients survive at a median time from transplant of 305 days (range 81-586 days). Fourteen have no evidence of disease; eight have or had only cytogenetic evidence of leukaemia. We conclude that the addition of TLI to pretransplant immunosuppression increases the probability of reliable engraftment in patients receiving T-cell depleted marrow. This benefit is not associated with significantly increased toxicity.\n",
      "PURPOSE: If radiation-induced genetic instability is causal in mouse radiation leukaemogenesis, then genetic instability should be detectable in the irradiated target untransformed haemopoietic stem cell, and evidence of genetic instability detected in the clonal radiation-induced leukaemia. We have tested this hypothesis using the CBA/H mouse model of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia (r-AML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was employed to screen for chromosomal aberrations in mouse 3 Gy X-ray-induced r-AMLs and in the clonal descendents of control and 3 Gy X-irradiated bone marrow haemopoietic stem cells using the in vitro clonogenic CFU-A colony assay. RESULTS: High levels of clonal non-specific chromosomal aberrations were detected in the r-AML (approximately 4-5 aberrations/r-AML), and ongoing chromosomal instability as defined by subclonal variants detected in 5/10 r-AML. A similar analysis of CFU-A colonies revealed chromosomal aberrations in 25% of colonies derived from irradiated bone marrow (2% in controls). However, 66% of the aberrant colonies (2% in controls) exhibited ongoing genetic instability as defined by non-clonal chromosomal aberrations. Overall, 6% (121/1884) of the CFU-A cells derived from irradiated bone marrow were aberrant (0.05% in controls) of which 12% (15/121) were subclonal. No one CFU-A cell exhibited aberrations on more than one of the three chromosomes painted. CONCLUSIONS: The high levels of non-specific genetic damage observed in the r-AMLs is therefore attributed to the accumulation of genetic lesions in the target haemopoietic stem cell over a longer time-scale after exposure than assessed in the in vitro CFU-A clonogenic assay. This is consistent with the long latency of the multi-stage radiation leukaemogenic process, and a role for radiation-induced genetic instability is inferred.\n",
      "Since Jehovah Witness (JW) patients diagnosed with leukaemia refuse blood transfusions, they are often denied intensive chemotherapy for fear they could not survive myeloablation without blood transfusion support. Treatment of JW patients with acute leukaemia is challenging and carries a higher morbidity and mortality; however, the refusal of blood products should not be an absolute contraindication to offer multiple treatment modalities including haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this review we discuss their optimal management and describe alternative modalities to blood transfusions to provide sufficient oxygenation and prevent bleeding.\n",
      "E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates Ca2+-dependent intracellular adhesion in normal epithelial cells. E-cadherin levels in serum are known to be significantly elevated in patients with epithelial carcinomas. However, the role of E-cadherin in haematopoietic cells is less clear. In this study, serum E-cadherin levels were therefore determined in patients with acute or chronic leukaemia, malignant lymphoma or myelodysplastic syndromes. Significant elevation of serum E-cadherin levels was detected in patients with haematological malignancies, and between types of acute leukaemias or subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes, stages of malignant lymphoma, and phases of chronic leukaemia, respectively, compared with those in healthy adult volunteers. These findings suggest that E-cadherin might be expressed in malignant haematopoietic cells and might be useful as a diagnostic indicator in haematological malignancies.\n",
      "Recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene initiate aggressive forms of leukaemia, which are often refractory to conventional therapies. Many MLL-fusion partners are members of the super elongation complex (SEC), a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation, suggesting that aberrant control of this process has an important role in leukaemia induction. Here we use a global proteomic strategy to demonstrate that MLL fusions, as part of SEC and the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc), are associated with the BET family of acetyl-lysine recognizing, chromatin 'adaptor' proteins. These data provided the basis for therapeutic intervention in MLL-fusion leukaemia, via the displacement of the BET family of proteins from chromatin. We show that a novel small molecule inhibitor of the BET family, GSK1210151A (I-BET151), has profound efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukaemic cell lines, through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151 treatment in two human leukaemia cell lines with different MLL fusions alters the expression of a common set of genes whose function may account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes (BCL2, C-MYC and CDK6) through the displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo studies indicate that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value, providing survival benefit in two distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9 and human MLL-AF4 leukaemia. Finally, the efficacy of I-BET151 against human leukaemia stem cells is demonstrated, providing further evidence of its potent therapeutic potential. These findings establish the displacement of BET proteins from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for these aggressive leukaemias.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The application of in vivo bioluminescence imaging to non-invasive, quantitative monitoring of tumour models relies on a positive correlation between the intensity of bioluminescence and the tumour burden. We conducted cell culture studies to investigate the relationship between bioluminescent signal intensity and viable cell numbers in murine leukaemia model cells. METHODS: Interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 was transduced with firefly luciferase to generate cells expressing luciferase stably under the control of a retroviral long terminal repeat. The luciferase-expressing cells were transduced with p190 BCR-ABL to give factor-independent proliferation. The cells were cultured under various conditions, and bioluminescent signal intensity was compared with viable cell numbers and the cell cycle stage. RESULTS: The Ba/F3 cells showed autonomous growth as well as stable luciferase expression following transduction with both luciferase and p190 BCR-ABL, and in vivo bioluminescence imaging permitted external detection of these cells implanted into mice. The bioluminescence intensities tended to reflect cell proliferation and responses to imatinib in cell culture studies. However, the luminescence per viable cell was influenced by the IL-3 concentration in factor-dependent cells and by the stage of proliferation and imatinib concentration in factor-independent cells, thereby impairing the proportionality between viable cell number and bioluminescent signal intensity. Luminescence per cell tended to vary in association with the fraction of proliferating cells. CONCLUSION: Although in vivo bioluminescence imaging would allow non-invasive monitoring of leukaemia model animals, environmental factors and therapeutic interventions may cause some discrepancies between tumour burden and bioluminescence intensity.\n",
      "Diverse types of blood cell (lineages) are produced from rare haematopoietic stem cells that reside in the bone marrow. This process, known as haematopoiesis, provides a valuable model for examining how genetic programs are established and executed in vertebrates, and also how homeostasis of blood formation is altered in leukaemias. So, how does an apparently small group of critical lineage-restricted nuclear regulatory factors specify the diversity of haematopoietic cells? Recent findings not only indicate how this may be achieved but also show the extraordinary plasticity of tissue stem cells in vivo.\n",
      "A total of 65 patients under the age of 55 with acute leukaemia received high-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) in combination with high-dose etoposide without an anthracycline. Complete remission rates for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) were 15/25 (60%) and 11/16 (69%), respectively. The complete remission rate for patients with refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was 10/18 (56%). The treatment-related mortality was 17%. Nine patients whose leukaemia relapsed after matched allogeneic, sibling bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) were also treated in this way; the treatment-related mortality in this group was high (7/9) and the duration of remission in the two patients who responded, too short to justify this intensive treatment in such patients. Similarly, patients who underwent BMT after achieving a complete remission with high-dose Ara-C and etoposide did very poorly, only one patient surviving well and disease-free at 8 months. The important finding in this study was the high complete remission rate rapidly obtained in patients with relapsed or refractory AML without using an anthracycline.\n",
      "CD3+ T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia is a mature T-cell neoplasm of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Neutropenia represents the most frequent peripheral blood cytopenia associated with CD3+ T-cell LGL leukaemia. A wide variety of diseases associated with LGL leukaemia have been reported, both autoimmune and neoplastic. We describe for the first time the association of true thymic hyperplasia with CD3+ T-cell line LGL leukaemia. The patient presented with severe symptomatic neutropenia. Complete and persistent haematological and molecular remission was induced with an association of low-dose methotrexate and cyclosporin A, followed by thymectomy.\n",
      "The effect of heparin as a reversing agent of multidrug resistance (MDR) was tested on normal mononuclear cells from 24 healthy volunteers and leukaemic cells from 12 acute myeloid leukaemia, five chronic myeloid leukaemia, five acute lymphoid leukaemia and three chronic lymphoid leukaemia patients. Two cell lines were used as controls, the human erythroleukaemia K562 and its vincristine-resistant derivative K562-Lucena 1. Heparin was not cytotoxic by itself as determined using a MTT assay and cell counts. MDR modulation was assessed by Rhodamine 123 extrusion using flow-cytometry. Modulation of the resistant cell line was produced by the classical reversing agent verapamil and also by heparin, the same being observed in normal and leukaemic cells and being independent of the type of leukaemia. Our work suggests that heparin may be considered a potential MDR modulator.\n",
      "Life-threatening bleeding, which remains a challenging complication of acute leukaemia, is particularly characteristic of the subtype, acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). The clinical picture and laboratory abnormalities are most compatible with the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Evidence for diffuse activation of the coagulation system, hyperfibrinolysis and systemic elaboration of non-specific protease activity can usually be demonstrated and occurs most commonly during induction chemotherapy. While both host- and tumour-associated mechanisms can be implicated in the pathogenesis of the coagulopathy, leukaemic cell properties appear to be the proximate cause of activation of the haemostatic mechanisms. In this chapter we summarize the current state of knowledge of the pathogenesis of the coagulopathy of APL and the therapeutic approaches that have proved most useful for the management of this complication. Special attention is devoted to the use of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which has revolutionized the treatment of APL and markedly ameliorated the APL-related coagulopathy.\n",
      "This is an historical account of the randomised trials in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in the UK between the years 1978 to 2004, describing their gestation, the treatments used and the main lessons learnt. Those lessons include: (1) how best to use chlorambucil, which was the first effective treatment for CLL; (2) the significant difference in survival between the sexes; and (3) the value of prognostic markers, both morphological and molecular, which continue to be relevant to current practice.\n",
      "Quantification of tumour-specific molecular markers at the RNA and DNA level for treatment response monitoring is crucial for risk-adapted stratification and guidance of individualized therapy in leukaemia and other malignancies. Most pediatric leukaemias and solid tumours of mesenchymal origin are characterized by a relatively low mutation burden at the single nucleotide level and the presence of recurrent chromosomal translocations. The genomic fusion sites resulting from translocations are stable molecular tumour markers; however, repeat-rich DNA sequences flanking intronic breakpoints limit the design of high sensitivity PCR assays for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. Here, we quantitatively evaluated the impact of repeat elements on assay selection and the feasibility of using extended amplicons (≤1330 bp) amplified by droplet digital PCR to monitor pediatric chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Molecular characterization of 178 genomic BCR-ABL1 fusion sites showed that 64% were located within sequence repeat elements, impeding optimal primer/probe design. Comparative quantification of DNA and RNA BCR-ABL1 copy numbers in 687 specimens from 55 pediatric patients revealed that their levels were highly correlated. The combination of droplet digital PCR, double quenched probes and extended amplicons represents a valuable tool for sensitive MRD assessment in CML and may be adapted to other translocation-positive tumours.\n",
      "A 19 year follow up study was conducted to explore the association between occupations expected to be exposed to electromagnetic fields and the occurrence of leukaemia and brain tumours. Incidence of cancer between 1961-79 was calculated and the standardised morbidity ratio (SMR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was related to that of all Swedish working men. For all the selected \"electrical occupations\" the SMRs for total leukaemia and brain tumours were near unity. Increased risks were noted for all leukaemia among electrical/electronic engineers and technicians, (SMR 1.3; 95% CI 1.0-1.7) as well as in the sub-groups of telegraph/telephone (2.1; 1.1-3.6) and machine (2.6; 1.0-5.8) industries. Risk for chronic lymphoid leukaemia was increased in the same occupational category (1.7; 1.1-2.5) and in the sub-group of machine industry (4.8; 1.0-14.0), as well as for all linesmen (2.0; 1.0-3.5) and power linesmen (2.8; 1.1-5.7). Risk for acute myeloid leukaemia was increased among all miners (2.2; 1.0-4.1) and miners working in iron/ore mines (5.7; 2.1-12.4). Increased risk for all brain tumours (2.9; 1.2-5.9) and glioblastomas (3.4; 1.1-8.0) appeared among assemblers and repairmen in radio and TV industry. Raised risk for all brain tumours was seen for all welders (1.3; 1.0-1.7) and welders in iron/steel works (3.2; 1.0-7.4) and risk for glioblastomas was also increased for all welders (1.5; 1.1-2.1). No major changes in relative risk estimates were noted after the exclusion of persons who were over 65 at the time of diagnosis. Although a homogeneous pattern of increased risks of leukaemia or brain tumour was not noted, the hypothesis that magnetic fields might play a part in the origin of cancer cannot be rejected.\n",
      "Many different aetiologies for childhood cancer have been suggested, but few are well established. One is that parental autoimmune disease is linked with susceptibility for haematopoietic malignancies in their offspring during childhood. The present study is the first to investigate this hypothesis using a follow-up design. A cohort of 53,811 children of more than 36,000 patients diagnosed with a systemic, organ-specific or suspected autoimmune disease were followed up for cancer incidence in the Danish Cancer Registry during 1968-1993. The parents were identified through the National Registry of Patients, while their children were traced in the Central Population Register. Cancer incidence among the offspring was compared with that in the corresponding childhood population of Denmark. In total, 115 cancers were observed among children aged 0-19 years, yielding a non-significant standardized incidence ratio of 1.07. Lymphomas contributed 21 cases to the overall number of tumours, 60% more than expected (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-2.4); leukaemia contributed 37 cases representing an excess of 30% (95% CI 0.9-1.8). Our results give some support to the hypothesis that parental autoimmune disease is associated with childhood lymphoma and leukaemia.\n",
      "Childhood leukaemia is the principal subtype of paediatric cancer and, despite success in treatment, its causes remain enigmatic. A plethora of candidate environmental exposures have been proposed, but most lack a biological rationale or consistent epidemiological evidence. Although there might not be a single or exclusive cause, an abnormal immune response to common infection(s) has emerged as a plausible aetiological mechanism.\n",
      "Relative to the commonly used anthracyclines, little is known about idarubicin and the development of multidrug resistance. We have previously shown the K562/IDA subline resulting from intermittent treatment of the K562 human leukaemia cell line with 20 ng/ml idarubicin did not develop multidrug resistance but became more sensitive to etoposide. Additional similar treatments of this subline produced the K562/IDA20 subline which partially retained its etoposide sensitivity although these cells expressed P-glycoprotein and were resistant to paclitaxel. Sensitization to etoposide was associated with increased decatenation activity of topoisomerase II, although there were no changes in topoisomerase IIalpha expression or formation of etoposide-dependent cleavable complexes. In comparison, the K562/IDA10 subline produced by intermittent treatment of the K562 cells, firstly with 5 ng/ml then 10 ng/ml idarubicin, showed no detectable expression of P-glycoprotein, decreased topoisomerase IIalpha expression and increased resistance to etoposide and amsacrine, but not to idarubicin or genistein. Even though intermittent treatment with idarubicin caused increased drug resistance in both sublines, they remained sensitive to idarubicin. Therefore the potential of idarubicin as a substitute for other anthracyclines in the treatment of cancer warrants further investigation.\n",
      "We performed a retrospective analysis of leukaemic surface antigen expression and genomic data from a total of 100 RUNX1-RUNX1T1-positive paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients enrolled in the Japanese Paediatric Leukaemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) AML-05 protocol to determine risk factors for relapse. In univariate analysis, the KIT exon 17 mutation (n = 21) and CD19 negativity (n = 59) were significant risk factors for relapse (P = 0·01). In multivariate analysis, CD19 negativity was the sole significant risk factor for relapse (hazard ratio, 3·09; 95% confidence interval, 1·26-7·59; P < 0·01), suggesting that biological differences between CD19-positive and CD19-negative RUNX1-RUNX1T1 AML patients should be investigated.\n",
      "In patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hyperfibrinolysis was observed in patients with leukaemia, but hypofibrinolysis was seen in those with sepsis. Although the plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) level was higher in patients with DIC than in those without DIC, there was no significant difference in t-PA level between the patients with leukaemia and sepsis. Hyperfibrinolysis might not be caused by t-PA derived from leukaemic cells, although the PA antigen level in leukaemic cell homogenates was significantly higher in patients with DIC than in those without DIC. The activation of t-PA by leukaemic cell homogenates in the absence of bromocyan fibrinogen fragments suggested that leukaemic cell homogenates had t-PA stimulator activity. The t-PA stimulator activity was high in both acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), especially in DIC, but this activity was not detected in chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) or normal cells. Since fibrinogen and soluble fibrin monomer complex levels in leukaemic cells were also high in patients with DIC, fibrinogen degradation products might be the major t-PA stimulator in leukaemic cells. This might be one of the causes of hyperfibrinolysis in leukaemia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The high heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) reflected in the patient- and disease-related factors accounts for the unsatisfactory prognosis despite the introduction of novel therapeutic approaches and drugs in recent years. METHODS: In the development set (n = 412), parameters including age, hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, biallelic CEBPA mutations, DNMT3A mutations, FLT3-ITD/NPM1 status, and ELN cytogenetic risk status were identified as independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in the multivariable Cox regression analysis. A nomogram combining these predictors for individual risk estimation was established thereby. FINDINGS: The prognostic model demonstrated promising performance in the development cohort. The calibration plot, C-index (0.74), along with the 1-, 2- and 3-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC, 0.76, 0.79, and 0.74, respectively) in the validation set (n = 238) substantiated the robustness of the model. In addition to stratifying young (age ≤ 60 years) and elderly patients (age > 60 years) into three and two risk groups with significant distinct outcomes, the prognostic model succeeded in distinguishing eligible candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. INTERPRETATION: The prognostic model is capable of survival prediction, risk stratification and helping with therapeutic decision-making with the use of easily acquired variables in daily clinical routine.

      "The acute reaction in the course of a total body irradiation (TBI) appears in an organ-specific damage of the stem cells. Moreover, there are unspecified central-nervous stress reactions. Clinical reactions are obtained by the study and symptomatic therapy is proposed. 90 patients with different forms of leukaemia were observed. We documented the course in a specific \"protocol system\". Reactions like an increase of body temperature, changes of pulse and blood pressure were registered. The occurrence of gastro-intestinal reactions is a typical symptom of the acute radiation syndrome e.g. vomiting and diarrhoea are demonstrated in dependence of the applicated dose of irradiation. Further symptoms of TBI appeared in the later period. Mucositis, parotitis, a decreased function of the salivary glands and diarrhoea as well as vomiting are characterized by different intensity and temporary termination. A difference between allogeneic and autologous transplantation is caused by a medicamental additional treatment. During the late period these symptoms will disappear completely. Moreover, after TBI and BMT late effects are a cataract and some changes in the hormonal system demanding a specific correction or substitution respectively.\n",
      "Benzene. The evidence for carcinogenicity of benzene in humans was evaluated by the IARC in 1982 as follows: \"It is established that human exposure to commercial benzene or benzene-containing mixtures can cause damage to the haematopoietic system, including pancytopenia. The relationship between benzene exposure and the development of acute myelogenous leukaemia has been established in epidemiological studies. \"Reports linking exposure to benzene with other malignancies were considered to be inadequate for evaluation. \"There is sufficient evidence that benzene is carcinogenic to man.\" This evaluation now warrants some elaboration and updating. While the epidemiological evidence concerning benzene carcinogenicity is strongest for acute myelocytic leukaemia, there is some limited evidence of increased risks of chronic myeloid and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In addition, recent studies have suggested an increased risk of multiple myeloma, while others indicate a dose-related increase for total lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms. Corroborative evidence for such a generalized effect comes from experimental studies showing that exposure to benzene depresses all lympho-haematopoietic cell lines. While only limited evidence of benzene carcinogenicity in experimental animals exists, the recent findings of the National Toxicology Program (NTP, 1984) in the U.S.A. and Maltoni et al. (1985) strongly indicate that benzene is an experimental carcinogen. Toluene and xylene. While no direct human evidence is available, there is recent evidence of carcinogenicity of toluene and xylene at high concentrations in experimental animals. It should also be noted that any future epidemiological observations of cancer risks associated with toluene or xylene would have to take account of the suspected effects of benzene impurities.\n",
      "Although the feasibility of using HLA-mismatched unrelated donors as an alternate graft source for haematopoietic SCT (HSCT) has been shown, little is known about the safety of HLA-mismatched DLI for the treatment of relapse. We examined the outcome of 58 consecutive leukaemia patients who received escalating-dose DLI for treatment of relapse after alemtuzumab-conditioned myeloablative unrelated donor HSCT at our institution. High-resolution HLA typing on stored DNA samples revealed mismatches in 28/58 patients who were considered HLA-matched at the time of transplantation. Following DLI from HLA-matched (10/10) (n=30) or -mismatched (7-9/10) (n=28) unrelated donors, we found no significant difference in the incidence of acute GVHD (17.2% versus 23.1%, P=0.59), probability of remission at 3 years (62.1% versus 63.9%, P=0.89) or 5-year OS (89.8% versus 77.7%, P=0.22). We conclude that escalating-dose DLI can be safely given to HLA-mismatched recipients following T-depleted myeloablative HSCT.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Children receiving Total Body Irradiation (TBI) in preparation for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) are at risk for Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD), which sometimes severely compromises their Final Height (FH). To better represent the impact of such therapies on growth we apply a mathematical model, which accounts both for the gompertzian-like growth trend and the hormone-related purts', and evaluate how the parameter values estimated on the children undergoing TBI differ from those of the matched normal population. METHODS: 25 patients long-term childhood lymphoblastic and myeloid acute leukaemia survivors followed at Pediatric Onco-Hematology, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Division, Regina Margherita Children Hospital (Turin, Italy) were retrospectively analysed for assessing the influence of TBI on their longitudinal growth and for validating a new method to estimate the GH therapy effects. Six were treated with GH therapy after a GHD diagnosis. RESULTS: We show that when TBI was performed before puberty overall growth and pubertal duration were significantly impaired, but such growth limitations were completely reverted in the small sample (6 over 25) of children who underwent GH replacement therapies. CONCLUSION: Since in principle the model could account for any additional growth purt' induced by therapy, it may become a useful imulation' tool for paediatricians for comparing the predicted therapy effectiveness depending on its timing and dosage.\n",
      "Limited therapeutic options are available after relapse of acute leukaemia following first reduced intensity conditioning haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (RIC1). A retrospective study on European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry data was performed on 234 adult patients with acute leukaemia who received a second RIC transplantation (RIC2) from 2000 to 2012 as a salvage treatment for relapse following RIC1. At the time of RIC2, 167 patients (71.4%) had relapsed or refractory disease, 49 (20.9%) were in second CR and 18 (7.7%) in third or higher CR. With a median follow-up of 21 (1.5-79) months after RIC2, 51 patients are still alive. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse incidence (RI), leukaemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were 22.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 17-28.4), 63.9% (56.7-70.1), 14.6% (8.8-18.5) and 20.5% (14.9-26.1), respectively. In patients with acute myelogenous, biphenotypic and undifferentiated leukaemia (representing 89.8% of all patients), duration of remission following RIC1 >225 days, presence of CR at RIC2, patient Karnofsky performance status >80 at RIC2 and non-myeloablative conditioning were found to be the strongest predictors of patients' favourable outcome.\n",
      "In the past few years research in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has led to remarkable advances in our understanding of the disease. Cytogenetic and molecular aberrations are the most important factors in determining response to chemotherapy as well as long-term outcome, but beyond prognostication are potential therapeutic targets. Our increased understanding of the pathogenesis of AML facilitated by next-generation sequencing has spurred the development of new compounds in the treatment of AML, particularly the creation of small molecules that target the disease on a molecular level. Many of the hopeful predictions outlined in our AML review of 2018 are now therapeutic realities: gemtuzumab ozogamicin, venetoclax, FLT3 inhibitors (midostaurin, gilteritinib), IDH inhibitors (ivosidenib, enasidenib), CPX-351, glasdegib, oral decitabine, and oral azacitidine. Others may soon be (quizartinib, APR246 magrolimab, menin inhibitors). The wealth of positive data allows reconsideration of what might soon be new standards of care in younger and older patients with AML. In this review we give an overview of recently approved therapies in AML and address present and future research directions.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive capacity of the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification of genetic risk in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 274 patients transplanted at our centre between 2004 and 2014. RESULTS: The ELN grouping is comparable to the Southwest Oncology Group/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (SWOG/ECOG) stratification in predicting the outcome after alloSCT [overall P = 0.0064 for disease-free survival (DFS), overall P = 0.003 for relapse]. Patients with an intermediate-1 profile have a significantly elevated 5-yr relapse incidence as compared to favourable risk patients, that is 40% vs. 15%, [hazard ratio (HR) 2.58, P = 0.048]. An intermediate-1 risk profile is an independent predictor for relapse as determined by multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR 3.05, P = 0.023). In intermediate-1 patients, the presence of an FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) is associated with a significantly increased relapse incidence (P = 0.0323), and a lower DFS (P = 0.0465). FLT3-ITD is an independent predictor for overall survival, DFS and relapse incidence in the intermediate-1 subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The ELN stratification of genetic risk predicts the outcome of patients with AML undergoing alloSCT. Patients with an intermediate-1 profile have a high risk for treatment failure due to relapse, which prompts the development of alternative treatment strategies.\n",
      "A female patient with therapy-related acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia occurring after intensive combined modality treatment for IIIB Hodgkin disease was transplanted from her HLA-identical brother. No attempt was made to induce a remission and the transplant was performed with standard chemoradiotherapeutic conditioning. Three years after the transplant the patient is alive in complete remission with a 46,XY karyotype. The donor has a mild, heterozygous beta-thalassaemia ('thalassaemia minima'). The recipient has much more pronounced thalassaemic features, similar to so-called thalassaemia intermedia, with peripheral blood smears indistinguishable from thalassaemia major. The erythrocytic alterations are undoubtedly due to the splenectomy which was performed during a staging procedure, but the marked difference between donor and recipient haemoglobin values cannot be attributed solely to the asplenic state.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: FLT-3 mutation is a valuable prognostic marker in patients of AML being related with bad prognosis and poor clinical response to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Frequency of FLT-3 mutation in AML varies from 25% to 35%. The objective of this study was to determine prevalence of FLT-3 mutation in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. METHODS: This observational cross-sectional Study was conducted in Department of Oncology, Jinnah Hospital Lahore from 1st October 2018 to 31st March 2019. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, aged 15-60 years, of both genders were included. After taking consent, demographic data was noted. Three ml of sample of blood was obtained from each patient and sent for detection of FLT-3 mutation. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20.0. Chi square test was applied, pvalue <0.05 significant. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean±SD age of patients was 34.72±14.3 years, among which 38.3% were female and 61.7% male. The mean±SD duration of disease was 3.39±2.8 months. The mean±SD haemoglobin level, TLC and platelet counts were 7.2±2.3 g/dl, 30,913±63,573 per cm and 58.6±52.3×103 per cm. The blast cell (%) count was 69.6±19.8. FLT-3 mutation was present in 18.9%. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that FLT-3 mutation to be present in only a minority of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia having no significant association with age, sex, haemoglobin, WBCs and blast counts.\n",
      "Surface markers were studied at first relapse in 66 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), using a panel of five monoclonal antibodies directed to CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33 and CD34 antigens. At time of relapse, there was increased expression of CD33 (P = 0.002) and CD34 (P = 0.0001), and decreased expression of CD13 (P = 0.004) and CD15 (P = 0.0001) antigens by comparison to initial diagnosis. There was no strict correlation with the FAB classification. However, CD13 and CD33 expression changes preferentially affected granulocytic leukaemias. At relapse, CD14 and CD34 were significantly more expressed in monocytic than in granulocytic AML (P = 0.01 and 0.003 respectively). In a multivariate analysis, CD34 expression was associated with a low CR rate (P = 0.001) and short survival (P = 0.05), whereas CD15 expression was associated with long survival (P = 0.0004). These results suggest that AML tends to relapse with a less differentiated phenotype than observed at diagnosis and that AML with less differentiated phenotype is of poor prognosis after first relapse, as also observed at diagnosis.\n",
      "The metabolism of bone marrow cells during the development of acute promyelocytic leukaemia has only been scarcely characterized, even though such knowledge might improve our understanding of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis as well as of drug treatment failure. We have investigated the in vitro oxygen consumption and the metabolism of palmitate in rat bone marrow cells during development of acute promyelocytic leukaemia. As the leukaemia progressed, the cellular oxygen consumption, the beta-oxidation of palmitate and the incorporation of palmitate into phospholipids all increased markedly. Cyclophosphamide supplement led to a temporary reduction of the palmitate metabolism, but did not lower the increased oxygen consumption. We conclude that the cellular metabolic rate is elevated during the progression of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, and that this might reflect an enhanced proliferative rate of the malignant cells.\n",
      "We investigated whether the levels of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activity and content correlate with drug sensitivity in different tumour materials and if this can be utilised in predicting treatment outcome. DNA-PK activity and expression were investigated in tumour cells from 8 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and 18 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), using Western blot and DNA-PK kinase activity assay. Tumour cells from the patients were investigated for their drug sensitivity to topoisomerase II inhibitors (doxorubicin and etoposide), DNA reactive agents (melphalan, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and cisplatinum), an antimetabolite (cytosine arabinoside) and an antimicrotubule agent (vincristine) by fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA). Within each group of leukaemia there was a large variation in both DNA-PK activity and DNA-PKcs expression, while the Ku subunits were expressed more homogeneously. In CLL cells, sensitivity to topoisomerase II inhibitors correlated with DNA-PKcs protein expression (r=0.7174, p=0.0452). In AML samples, sensitivity to DNA cross-linking alkylating agents correlated with Ku86 (r=-0.7512, p=0.0031) and Ku70 (r=-0.6134, p=0.0258) expression. Unexpectedly, DNA-PK activity was found to correlate with sensitivity to vincristine in both CLL (r=0.8557, p=0.0067) and AML (r=0.5480, p=0.0228) cells. The results indicate that DNA-PK is not only involved in the recognition of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), but also other DNA lesions.\n",
      "We generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of the Tie receptor tyrosine kinase and studied its expression in human haemopoietic and tumour cell lines and in samples from leukaemia patients. Most of the erythroblastic/megakaryoblastic (6/8), 2/7 myeloid and 3/6 B-lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines were Tie-positive. The erythroblastic/megakaryoblastic leukaemia cell lines also expressed the related Tie-2/Tek gene and, surprisingly, its recently cloned ligand gene angiopoietin-1, which was located in chromosome 8q23.1. In addition, 16% of freshly isolated leukaemia samples were Tie positive. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were Tie negative, but a few Tie positive cells were found in immunoperoxidase staining of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Long-term culture of isolated umbilical cord blood CD34+ Tie+ and CD34+ Tie- cells indicated that the Tie+ fraction contained a slightly higher frequency of cobblestone area forming cells (CAFC). Thus, Tie is expressed on haemopoietic progenitor cells and some leukaemic blasts. The coexpression of Tie-2 and angiopoietin-1 in megakaryoblastic leukaemia cell lines suggests the existence of an autocrine ligand/receptor signalling loop in these cells.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and severity of physical and psychosexual symptoms in young women due to ovarian failure caused by total body irradiation for leukaemia and the women response to hormone treatment. DESIGN: Postal questionnaire and interview. SETTING: Leukaemia unit of oncology hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive series of 46 English speaking women who had developed ovarian failure after total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation as treatment for leukaemia. RESULTS: Of the 36 responders, 33 reported some symptoms, vaginal dryness being the most common (29). This profoundly affected sexual function. Although 22 women had had sexual intercourse within six months after treatment, 16 were less interested in and 18 experienced difficulties with sexual intercourse. Anxieties about sterility, femininity, and appearance were common and reduced self confidence. Almost half reported that they had changed their social habits and restricted their social activities. Treatment seemed effective in abolishing symptoms in 24 women, but vaginal dryness remained a problem in three. Two women failed to respond and intercourse remained impossible. CONCLUSIONS: Such patients are vulnerable and access to gynaecologists and endocrinologists soon after treatment would be valuable. The optimal treatment regimen and the long term benefits of treatment have yet to be established.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: We report a rare case of concurrent myeloid sarcoma and acute fulminant invasive fungal sinusitis in a patient with relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old man was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia and developed relapse one year later. After two courses of azacytidine, he began suffering from a dull pain in the left temporal and orbital regions. Sinus computed tomography showed a localised lesion in the left ethmoid sinus, which rapidly progressed to an extensive intracranial mass within one month. Surgical debridement was performed, and histopathological analysis revealed the coexistence of myeloid sarcoma and acute fulminant invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient responded well to prompt surgical debridement, antifungal medication and radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Coexistence of sinonasal myeloid sarcoma and acute fulminant invasive fungal sinusitis poses an urgent diagnostic and management challenge to clinicians. Timely recognition of this rare comorbid condition is warranted as application of appropriate treatment can save lives.\n",
      "Many agents used in cancer chemotherapy are known carcinogens. However, few secondary malignancies have been definitely linked to chemotherapy, since studies on this problem are complicated by methodological problems. A causal relationship has been established between alkylating agents and leukaemia and between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer. The risk of leukaemia peaks at 5-10 years after beginning of chemotherapy and declines steadily after its end. The interaction between chemotherapy and radiotherapy has not been fully clarified, nor has the leukaemogenic potency of individual drugs, although combinations without nitrogen mustard seem to entail a lower risk. Other tumours reported at increased incidence, in particular among Hodgkin disease patients, for whom a carcinogenic effect of chemotherapy seems plausible, are non-Hodgkin lymphoma and lung cancer. Other secondary solid tumors have also been reported, but for none of them an independent effect of chemotherapy has been demonstrated.\n",
      "A recent study by Knox concludes that cases and \"clusters\" of two or more cases of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma occur closer to many kinds of industrial installation than to supposedly comparable control locations. It is argued that these findings could be largely or entirely artefactual, the apparent differences arising out of the inappropriateness of the control data. Knox used randomly selected postcode units as controls, a procedure that leads to the comparison of individuals located in areas with typically quite different population densities from those for the cases. The resulting potential for bias is explored and the arguments are exemplified by analysing household data based on postcodes.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To investigate a cluster of leukaemia among young people and assess the plausibility of a disease-exposure relationship. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of population-based leukaemia incidence data, review of evidence related to the causation of leukaemia, assessment of environmental exposures to known leukaemogens, and resulting risks of leukaemia. SETTING: Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia, focusing on suburbs between the Port Kembla industrial complex and Lake Illawarra (the Warrawong area). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for leukaemia; current measured and past estimated ambient air benzene concentrations; and expected leukaemia cases attributable to estimates of ambient air benzene concentrations. RESULTS: In 1989-1996, 12 leukaemia cases among Warrawong residents aged less than 50 years were observed, more than the 3.49 cases expected from the rate in the rest of the Illawarra region (SIR, 343.8; 99% CI, 141.6-691.7). These people lived in suburbs immediately to the south-southwest of a coke byproducts plant (a major industrial source of benzene, one of the few known leukaemogens). The greatest excess was among 15-24-year-olds (SIR, 1085.6; 99% CI, 234.1-3072.4). In 1996, ambient air concentrations of benzene averaged less than 1 part per billion (ppb). Since 1970, ambient air concentrations of benzene were estimated to have averaged up to 3 ppb, about one-thousandth of the level at which leukaemia risk has been identified in occupational epidemiological studies. Using the risk assessment model developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, we estimate that past benzene levels in the Warrawong area could have resulted in 0.4 additional cases of leukaemia in 1989-1996. CONCLUSIONS: The excess occurrence of leukaemia in the Warrawong area in 1989-1996 is highly unusual. Current environmental benzene exposure and the reconstructed past environmental benzene exposure level are too low to explain the large excess of leukaemia. The cause of the cluster is uncertain.\n",
      "From April 1988 to May 1993, 71 patients (32 acute myelogenous leukaemia [AML], 24 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [ALL], 7 Hodgkin disease [HD], 5 non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], 2 neuroblastoma, 1 chronic myelogenous leukaemia [CML]) were treated with myeloablative therapy followed by reinfusion of cryopreserved autologous bone marrow (ABMT). The majority of patients with acute leukaemia were in first complete remission (CR), while 11 AML patients and 9 ALL patients were in advanced stage of the disease (> I CR or relapse). The BM was reinfused without purging. The conditioning regimen for all ALL and proportion of AML patients consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg and fractionated total body irradiation (TB) in a total dose of 12 Gy. 18 AML patients received busulfan 16 mg/kg instead of TBI. Leukaemia-free survival (LFS) for first CR AML patients was 48% at 43 months with the median follow-up of 17 months. Probability of relapse was 44%. LFS for advanced AML was only 9% and the probability of relapse 89%. LFS for first CR ALL patients was 72% at 53 months with the median follow-up of 15 months, while probability of relapse was only 23%. For advanced ALL, LFS was 32% at 33 months and probability of relapse 64%. Probability of toxic death for first CR patients was 11%. We found a predictive value of viability testing and in vitro CFU-GM assay for haematologic recovery after ABMT. We conclude that ABMT with cryopreserved BM is a relatively safe method for consolidation therapy of AL. The results of treatment are encouraging.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To reappraise the epidemiological findings reported by the Black Advisory Group concerning a possible excess of malignant disease, particularly of childhood acute lymphoid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, in the vicinity of the Sellafield nuclear installation, and to determine whether any excess of malignant disease had occurred among people aged 0-24 years in the area in the years after the Black report--that is, from 1984 to 1990. DESIGN: Calculation of incidence of cancer using data from population based cancer registries and special surveys. SETTING: England and Wales; county of Cumbria; county districts Allerdale and Copeland within Cumbria; Seascale ward within Copeland. SUBJECTS: All residents under the age of 75 years in the above areas, but with particular reference to those aged 0-24 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of cases and incidence particularly of lymphoid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas in those aged 0-24 years, but including other cancers and age groups. RESULTS: Previous reports of an increased incidence of cancer, especially of leukaemia, among those aged 0-24 years in Seascale during the period up to and including 1983 are confirmed. During 1984-90 there was an excess of total cancer among those aged 0-24 years. This was based on four cases including two cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma but none of leukaemia. There was an increased, but nonsignificant, incidence of other cancers, based on two cases (one pinealoma and one Hodgkin disease) occurring among those aged 15-24 years during 1984-90. This was not observed in the younger age group or in previous years. For the immediately surrounding area--that is, the county districts of Allerdale and Copeland excluding Seascale and in the remainder of Cumbria--there was no evidence of an increased incidence of cancer among those aged 0-24 years in either period. CONCLUSIONS: During 1963-83 and 1984-90 the incidence of malignant disease, particularly lymphoid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, in young people aged 0-24 in Seascale was higher than would be expected on the basis of either national rates or those for the surrounding areas. Although this increased risk is unlikely to be due to chance, the reasons for it are still unknown.\n",
      "The use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was a revolutionary step in molecular biology, allowing for small amounts of genetic material to be amplified and studied. The advent of real-time PCR was a further refinement that led to reliable quantification of RNA and DNA. This allowed response monitoring and the detection of minimal residual disease, which proved to have important correlations with outcome in certain malignancies. The technology is indispensable for physicians and pathologists caring for oncology patients. In this article we will review the applications of molecular technology in the diagnosis and management of malignancies. Using chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) as an example, technical aspects and clinical correlations will be discussed, with emphasis on the importance of quality assurance and standardisation to allow for comparability of results across laboratories. We will also examine emerging technologies that allow for high throughput and rapid turnaround of specimens and speculate how these would affect outcomes in future health care. The established and emerging molecular technologies have applications in many fields of oncology.\n",
      "Institutional database search (1999-2020) for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) identified 109 cases of myeloid sarcoma (MS), of which 19 were isolated and presented de novo. The latter displayed longer survival (median 78 months), compared to MS with synchronous intramedullary AML (n = 32; median 16 months) and de novo AML without MS (n = 729; median 22 months; P = 0·13). However, the difference in survival was no longer apparent after accounting for bone marrow cytogenetic risk status (P = 0·67). Treatment-induced MS tumour resolution was not affected by the presence of intramedullary disease (P = 0·61). The current study clarifies the prognosis of de novo isolated MS, in the context of AML.\n",
      "Open-ended interviews were used to examine parental psychological reactions, difficulties and resources during the period following the diagnosis of childhood leukaemia. Data were obtained from 71 randomly selected mothers and fathers of children diagnosed with leukaemia at least 3 months prior to the study. The content analysis revealed a wide diversity of parental responses including many of the defensive mechanisms described in the literature such as shock, denial, anxiety and guilt. The most difficult factors for the parents to deal with during the initial period were the psychological upset and the financial burden. Problems associated with relating to others and to the health care system were also identified. Hope, social support and the marital relationship were the most helpful resources in managing the multifaceted problems caused by the diagnosis. Forty-five per cent of the participants felt that the quality of their marital relationship was improved, whereas fewer reported that the diagnosis seriously disturbed their marriage. Spouses were found to adopt symmetrical rather than complementary ways of responding to and coping with the event. Nurses have a key role in assessing the individual parent, the marital unit and the entire family system and planning appropriate interventions.\n",
      "The results of a previous study suggested that an association between childhood leukaemia and the radiation dose received occupationally by a father before the conception of his child might provide the explanation for the marked excess of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the village of Seascale, West Cumbria. The present study identifies other small areas (electoral wards) in West Cumbria where excess cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in young people have occurred and determines whether a recorded dose of radiation was received occupationally by the father before the conception of each of the affected individuals. Forty-one cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were diagnosed during 1968-85 in young people under 25 years of age resident in the 49 electoral wards lying within the boundary of West Cumbria and the adjacent ward of Broughton. Raised incidence rate ratios (two-sided P<0.01) were found for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia among those aged 0-14 years (concentrated among those aged 0-4 years) in Seascale ward and among those aged 0-24 years (also concentrated among those aged 0-4 years) in Egremont North ward, for acute myeloid leukaemia among those aged 0-14 years in Sandwith ward, for all leukaemias among those aged 0-14 years in Broughton ward (South Lakeland) and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma among those aged 0-14 years in Seascale ward. For West Cumbria as a whole, incidence rates were not usual. Apart from Seascale, for none of these electoral wards has a father of an affected child been linked definitely to an occupational dose of radiation recorded before the conception of the child. Particularly striking are the excesses of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases among young children living in the wards of Seascale and Egremont North, situated 11 km apart. The cases in Egremont North are not associated with recorded doses of radiation received occupationally by fathers before the conception of the affected children, even though the total numbers of children associated with such doses born in Seascale and Egremont North wards are similar. This finding is further evidence against a causal role for paternal preconceptional radiation exposure in the cases of childhood leukaemia in Seascale.\n",

SUBJECTS: 528 Men known to have participated in the tests and a control group of 1504 men who were in the Royal New Zealand Navy during the same period but did not participate in the tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and incidence of cancer. RESULTS: Follow up for the period 1957-87 was 94% complete in test participants and 91% complete in the controls. There were 70 deaths among test participants and 179 deaths among controls, yielding a relative risk of 1.08 (90% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.38, p = 0.29). The relative risk of death from causes other than cancer was 0.96 (0.71 to 1.29, p = 0.59) whereas the relative risk of death from cancer was 1.38 (0.90 to 2.10, p = 0.09) and of the incidence of cancer was 1.12 (0.78 to 1.60, p = 0.29). For cancers other than haematological malignancies the relative risk was 1.14 (0.69 to 1.83, p = 0.31) for mortality and 1.01 (0.67 to 1.50, p = 0.48) for incidence. There were seven deaths from haematological cancers among test participants (relative risk 3.25, 90% confidence interval 1.12 to 9.64, p = 0.02), including four leukaemias (5.58, 1.04 to 41.6, p = 0.03). The relative risk for incidence of haematological cancers was 1.94 (0.74 to 4.84, p = 0.10) and that for leukaemia was 5.51 (1.03 to 41.1, p = 0.03). There were no cases of multiple myeloma in the test participants during the follow up period, but the expected number was only 0.3. CONCLUSIONS: Although the numbers are small, the findings for leukaemia are similar to those for British participants in the nuclear weapons test programme. Some leukaemias, and possibly some other haematological cancers, may have resulted from participation in this programme. There is little evidence of an increased risk for non-haematological cancers, and there is no evidence of an increased risk for causes of death other than cancer.\n",
      "The objective of the present study was to report the case of a pregnant woman with severe gingival enlargement for 3 months with undiagnosed acute leukaemia. The pregnant woman presented with anaemia and generalized gingival enlargement. A provisional diagnosis of gingival enlargement in pregnancy was made. Twelve days after the initial treatment, the patient was referred and admitted to the haematology department of a local hospital with clinical signs of anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Blood count showed a white blood cell count of 9.68 × 109 /L, with a haemoglobin count of 64.0 g/L and a platelet count of 17 × 109 /L. Bone marrow aspiration showed 94.5% monoblasts, and the morphological diagnosis was acute monocytic leukaemia. One day after admission, the patient delivered a male infant by Caesarean section. Ten days after the Caesarean section, the patient was started on a course of chemotherapy. Pulmonary infection, hypokalaemia, and respiratory failure developed, and the patient died 23 days after the Caesarean section. The present case shows the importance of awareness of severe gingival enlargement as an initial oral sign of acute leukaemia.\n",
      "The presence of TEL/AML1 fusion gene in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) defines a subgroup of patients with better than average outcome. However, the prognostic significance of this aberration has recently been disputed by the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) study group due to its relatively high incidence found in relapsed patients (19.6% and 21.9%, in two cohorts). In contrast, only four out of 45 (8.9%) unselected relapsed patients (all of whom had been treated according to BFM protocols) in the Czech Republic carry this fusion. From March 1995 to June 1998, 41 out of 190 (21.6%) newly diagnosed children with ALL were TEL/AML1-positive. There is a statistically significant difference between the incidence of TEL/AML1 fusion at diagnosis and at relapse within our group (P = 0.035). Interim analysis of the minimal residual disease (MRD) detection shows heterogeneity within the group of newly diagnosed TEL/AML1-positive leukaemias--10 out of 24 patients tested at the end of induction therapy had detectable levels of MRD. However, only one of these patients reached relapse-predictive level (10(-3)) of MRD. In conclusion, we corroborate low frequency of TEL/AML1 positivity among relapsed patients with ALL among Czech children who are treated by the BFM protocols. Moreover, we demonstrate different patterns of bone marrow clean-up in TEL/AML1-positive patients.\n",
      "We describe here a 72-year-old female patient with an acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (M7 by FAB Classification) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient had not been pretreated with immunosuppressive therapy, which is potentially leukaemogenic. The karyotype displayed multiple, structural and numerical anomalies, suggesting a possible de novo rather than a secondary nature of leukaemia.\n",
      "Disease stage and recipient/donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching are important determinants of outcome in transplantation using volunteer-unrelated donors (VUD). Matching for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 is beneficial, whereas the importance of DPB1 matching is more controversial. The impact of HLA matching status may differ dependent on disease stage. We investigated the outcome according to the degree of HLA matching at 6 loci, in 488 recipients of predominantly T-cell depleted bone marrow VUD transplants for leukaemia. Survival was significantly better in 12/12-matched transplants in those with early leukaemia (5 years: 63 versus 41% in 10/10 matched, P=0.006), but not late stage disease. Conversely, within the HLA-mismatched group (< or =9/10), there was a significant survival advantage to DPB1 mismatching (5 years: 39 versus 21% in DPB1 matched, P=0.008), particularly in late leukaemia (P=0.01), persisting in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 0.478; 95% confidence interval 0.30, 0.75; P=0.001). These novel findings suggest that the best outcome for patients with early leukaemia, with a 10/10-matched donor, is achieved by matching for DPB1. Conversely, our results suggest that in patients receiving an HLA-mismatched graft, the outcome is significantly better if they are also mismatched for DPB1. We recommend validation of these results in independent datasets.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia is characterized by marked inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity, the identification of which is critical for the design of personalized treatments. Heterogeneity of leukaemic cells is determined by mutations which ultimately affect the cell cycle. We have developed and validated a biologically relevant, mathematical model of the cell cycle based on unique cell-cycle signatures, defined by duration of cell-cycle phases and cyclin profiles as determined by flow cytometry, for three leukaemia cell lines. The model was discretized for the different phases in their respective progress variables (cyclins and DNA), resulting in a set of time-dependent ordinary differential equations. Cell-cycle phase distribution and cyclin concentration profiles were validated against population chase experiments. Heterogeneity was simulated in culture by combining the three cell lines in a blinded experimental set-up. Based on individual kinetics, the model was capable of identifying and quantifying cellular heterogeneity. When supplying the initial conditions only, the model predicted future cell population dynamics and estimated the previous heterogeneous composition of cells. Identification of heterogeneous leukaemia clones at diagnosis and post-treatment using such a mathematical platform has the potential to predict multiple future outcomes in response to induction and consolidation chemotherapy as well as relapse kinetics.\n",
      "Bone marrow (BM) samples from 24 patients with acute leukaemia (AML 17, ALL seven) in first complete remission were compared to samples from 10 normal donors with regard to their content in long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) as assessed by a limiting dilution assay and the clonogeneic capacity of these cells, in order to determine whether remission marrow cells displayed any specific defect at the primitive stem cell level. The frequency of LTC-IC in the whole patient group was 1 in 3487 +/- 3125 mononuclear cells (MNC) as compared to 1 in 794 +/- 492 MNC in normal controls (P = 0.0009), with no difference between AML and ALL. Moreover, the clonogeneic capacities were 2.66 +/- 0.7 (range 1.8-1.6) and 4.0 +/- 1.6 (range 2.2-7.9) CFC per LTC-IC in patients and controls respectively (P = 0.0015). These quantitative and qualitative defects were aggravated by treatment with mafosfamide at a dose of 50 microg/10(7) MNC/ml, where the mean recovery of LTC-IC after in vitro purging was 42%. In nine patients autografted with purged marrow following high-dose radiochemotherapy, no correlation could be detected between the dose of LTC-IC (mean 6742 +/- 7877/kg) and the kinetics of recovery of haemopoiesis. We concluded that, in acute leukaemia patients in complete remission, the presumably normal residual stem cell pool was not only quantitatively diminished but also qualitatively altered in its capacity to give rise to clonogeneic progenitor cells.\n",
      "Unrelated donor (URD) bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in adults can be associated with high non-relapse mortality (NRM). Therefore, factors determining survival in 136 human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A, B, DRB1-matched adult BMT recipients were reviewed. Fifty-four per cent of patients had chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and 36% had acute leukaemia or myelodysplasia. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was either cyclosporin A (CSA)/methotrexate (64%) or T-cell depletion and CSA/corticosteroids (34%). The probability of donor engraftment by d 45 was 97% (95% CI: 94-100). Incidence of grades III-IV acute GvHD was 18% (95% CI: 12-24) at 100 d, and chronic GvHD was 42% (95% CI: 32-52) at 2 years. At 2 years, 14% (95% CI: 8-20) had relapsed. Multiple regression analysis showed that adverse risk factors for survival were non-CML diagnosis, age > 35 years, diagnosis to transplant time of > 18 months [chronic-phase CML (CML-CP) only]; and grades III-IV acute GvHD. Patients <or= 35 years with early CML-CP had a 2 year survival of 77% (95% CI: 54-100), which compared with a survival in advanced CML patients <or=35 years of 67% (95% CI: 37-97) and 37% (95% CI: 20-54) in non-CML patients. Two year survival for patients > 35 years with early CML-CP was 55% (95% CI: 33-77), 40% (95% CI: 19-61) in advanced CML and 14% (95% CI:1-27) in non-CML. Future efforts should focus on improving the outcome for older BMT recipients, especially those with diagnoses other than CML.\n",
      "We present a 54-year-old man who underwent human leucocyte antigen-identical sibling nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplant for primary refractory T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL). His clinical course was complicated by fulminant haemolysis and acute renal failure at the time of engraftment because of minor ABO incompatibility between the donor and the recipient. This case highlights the curative potential of nonmyeloablative transplantation for T-PLL as well as the potential severity of immune haemolysis secondary to minor ABO incompatibility.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has several unique features that distinguish it from other cancers. Most CLL tumour cells are inert and arrested in G0/G1 of the cell cycle and there is only a small proliferative compartment; however, the progressive accumulation of malignant cells will ultimately lead to symptomatic disease. Pathogenic mechanisms have been elucidated that involve multiple external (for example, microenvironmental stimuli and antigenic drive) and internal (genetic and epigenetic) events that are crucial in the transformation, progression and evolution of CLL. Our growing understanding of CLL biology is allowing the translation of targets and biological classifiers into clinical practice.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a common lymphoid malignancy characterized by the expansion and progressive accumulation of mature autoreactive B lymphocytes. The disease is clinically heterogeneous and incurable by standard chemotherapy. A major feature of the disease is the marked dependence of the leukaemic cells on various microenvironmental stimuli, which promote leukaemia cell growth, survival, and drug-resistance. Recently, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive CLL. The identification of recurrent genetic lesions using next generation sequencing technology has provided new data on the pathophysiology of the disease and has improved its prognostication. The recognition of the critical role of the B cell receptor (BCR) in driving the disease has resulted in the development of BCR pathway inhibitors that have the potential to completely transform CLL treatment in the near future. Other novel therapeutic agents, such as BCL2 antagonists and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T-cells, are also showing great promise in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize some of these recent advances, with a particular focus on the BCR and corresponding pathway inhibitors.\n",
      "We report two cases of acute myelomonocytic leukaemia with abnormal eosinophils (M4Eo) in which the presenting feature was small bowel obstruction. We suggest there is a unique clinicopathological association between small intestine involvement with leukaemia and the M4Eo subtype. Central nervous system involvement by myeloblastoma occurred in one of the two cases which is a recognised feature of M4Eo and should necessitate prophylaxis with intrathecal therapy. Inversion of chromosome 16 which is a cytogenetic marker for M4Eo was demonstrable in one of the two cases.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a blood cancer affecting haematopoietic stem cells. AML is routinely treated with chemotherapy, and so it is of great interest to develop optimal chemotherapy treatment strategies. In this work, we incorporate an immune response into a stem cell model of AML, since we find that previous models lacking an immune response are inappropriate for deriving optimal control strategies. Using optimal control theory, we produce continuous controls and bang-bang controls, corresponding to a range of objectives and parameter choices. Through example calculations, we provide a practical approach to applying optimal control using Pontryagin Maximum Principle. In particular, we describe and explore factors that have a profound influence on numerical convergence. We find that the convergence behaviour is sensitive to the method of control updating, the nature of the control, and to the relative weighting of terms in the objective function. All codes we use to implement optimal control are made available.\n",
      "GOAL OF WORK: The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of the reported availability of social support on the 2-year survival of patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with newly diagnosed AML were asked to rate the level of available social support after diagnosis was made, but before the start of chemotherapy. Social support was assessed with the F-SozU, and information about confounding variables (age, functional status, intensity of chemotherapy, cytogenetic risk group) was collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to analyze predictors of 2-year survival. MAIN RESULTS: Higher levels of available social support predicted better survival, even after controlling for age, functional status, dosage of chemotherapy, and cytogenetic risk group. Within social support, the availability of instrumental support showed more consistent associations with 2-year survival than the availability of emotional support. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with AML, the availability of social support is relevant for decreased mortality, after accounting for age, functional impairment, dosage of chemotherapy and cytogenetic risk group.\n",
      "Thymidylate synthase (TS) expression has been characterized for a panel of eight human colorectal carcinoma and five human leukaemia cell lines, to relate differences in intrinsic TS activity, protein and mRNA levels to growth inhibition caused by continuous exposure to THYMITAQ, a specific non-classical antifolate TS inhibitor. Although a 20-fold variation in sensitivity to THYMITAQ was found within the colorectal cell line panel (IC50 0.12-2.7 microM), sensitivity was not related to TS activity, TS protein or TS mRNA levels. For the leukaemic cell lines, only a twofold range in sensitivity to THYMITAQ was observed (IC50 0.87-2.3 microM), and this did not correlate with TS activity, TS protein or TS mRNA levels. Across all of the cell lines, TS activity was linearly related to TS protein levels (r2 = 0.87, P < 0.0001). However, for both the colorectal and leukaemia cell line panels, no relationship was found between TS mRNA/18S rRNA ratios and either TS activity or TS protein, consistent with the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in regulating TS activity. Two of the colorectal cell lines (BE and HCT116) and one of the human leukaemic cell lines (HL60), were intrinsically resistant to THYMITAQ (IC50 > 2 microM) in the absence of TS overexpression, suggesting that, subsequent to TS inhibition, events such as DNA repair and tolerance to apoptotic stimuli are also important determinants of sensitivity to THYMITAQ.\n",
      "A series of studies was carried out to determine the effect of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) on leukaemia. The study aimed at two different, but strictly linked issues: (1) identification of the eradication capability of BMT, and (2) evaluation of the effect of BMT, both in preventing relapse and in producing long-term disease-free survival. Fifty-four patients allografted for leukaemia were evaluated at various intervals, after bone marrow transplantation, for the presence of host haemopoiesis using red-blood-cell and cytogenetic markers. Among 40 patients in remission, 10 showed functional host and donor haemopoiesis (mixed chimerism), while in 30, host haemopoiesis was never detected (complete chimerism). Seven of the 14 evaluable patients who relapsed showed the reappearance of host haemopoiesis at the time of relapse. The records of received doses of TBI indicate that patients who achieved mixed chimerism, either relapsing or not, received significantly lower doses than complete chimeras. However, some patients with complete chimerism received a TBI dose equivalent to the dose received by those with mixed chimerism, suggesting that the TBI dose is not the only factor determining the reappearance of host haemopoiesis. The data on chimerism and relapse suggest that there is heterogeneity in radiosensitivity between normal marrow cells and leukaemic cells, and further, within the different types of leukaemia. The incidence/severity of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) was significantly higher in complete chimeras than in mixed chimeras suggesting that mixed chimerism may play a role in the development of tolerance; however, it could be the tolerance (i.e. absence of GvHD) which is responsible for the persistence of host haemopoietic cells. One-hundred-and-sixty-eight patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia were analyzed for risk factor associated with relapse. All patients received marrow from an HLA identical sibling after preparation with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and total body irradiation (TBI) of 330 cGy on days -3, -2, -1. There was a difference of +/- 18% between the nominal total dose of 990 cGy and the actual received dose as indicated by dosimetric recordings. While interstitial pneumonitis had minimal impact on survival there was a considerable difference in the incidence of relapses. The incidence of relapse was higher in patients receiving less, than in patients receiving more than 1000 cGy respectively and this had a major impact on survival. However, transplant-related mortality was slightly higher in the group of patients receiving higher doses of TBI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n",
      "The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of malignant hemopathies among patients in Dakar hospital and to examine the current methods of treatment in Senegal. A retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed in Dakar hospitals from 1st January 1986 to 31st December 1992 revealed 210 cases of malignant hemopathies, but only 155 patient records were retrieved (73.8%). The prevalence of malignant hemopathies was 7/1000 and males were predominant with a sex ratio of 1.6 (p = 0.0001). Acute leukaemias (AL) appeared mainly in young people with a mean age of occurrence of 18.8 years, while immunoproliferative syndromes (IS) and myeloproliferative syndromes (MS) were mostly found in adults with respective mean ages of occurrence of 38.9 and 38.7 years (p = 0.000004 AL vs IS, p = 0.00001 AL vs MS). Concerning therapy, 14.2% of patients died without treatment and 26.1% received only symptomatic treatment. Chemotherapy was employed in 61% of cases, complete remission being obtained in 20.6% of these patients but of no remission in the remaining 79.4%. Mean survival was 2 months for AL, 5 months for IS and 6 months for MS. Close collaboration between haematologists and clinicians and creation of a specialized clinical haematology department will be necessary to overcome current difficulties in the treatment of these affections.\n",
      "Late relapse of leukaemia is rare in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) subjected to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in chronic phase. Herein, we report a patient who presented with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who after chemotherapy developed a picture consistent with CML in chronic phase. He then received an allograft from an HLA-identical sister and remained in complete remission for 4 years, before he eventually relapsed with features of myeloid transformation of CML. We speculate that the same population of already transformed leukaemic progenitor cells may have given rise to the original lymphoid blast cells and the myeloid blast cells that characterized the terminal relapse.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) are chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (B-LPDs) with distinct clinical, morphological and immunocytochemical features. Transformation of CLL into other B-LPDs (prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) and large cell lymphoma) is a well recognised phenomenon. One previous report has suggested that HCL may also arise by clonal evolution from CLL. We report the case of a 75 year old man in whom a diagnosis of coexisting HCL was made seventeen years after an initial diagnosis of CLL. Immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement studies suggest that the two B-LPDs developed independently. A steady increase in the bone marrow HCL component at the expense of the CLL component was observed with time, suggesting that HCL may have a growth advantage over CLL.\n",
      "One hundred and sixty-two patients initially treated at St Bartholomew Hospital between 1974 and 1988 developed recurrent acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). In the majority, the intention was to administer intensive chemotherapy again; 22/162 were re-treated palliatively. A second complete remission (CR) was achieved in 50/126 (40%) evaluable patients. Several different regimens were employed over this time period; the treatment used was the only factor that correlated with achievement of second CR (P = 0.04). Ten of the 50 patients received myeloablative therapy with either allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation in second CR. The median duration of second CR for those patients who did not proceed to intensive consolidation with bone marrow transplantation was 7 months. There was no correlation between second remission duration and age, or with the administration of either intensive or conventional consolidation therapy. The median survival from first recurrence for all patients was 4 months, increasing to only 5 1/2 months for those re-treated with chemotherapy and to 12 months for those patients in whom a second CR was achieved, confirming the very poor prognosis of these patients.\n",
      "A decade ago, gene expression profiling (GEP) was successfully introduced in haematological research. Considering the heterogeneity of haematological malignancies, the growing arsenal of compounds, allowing targeted therapy, e.g. in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), and the more differentiated indication to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, routine diagnostic procedures would highly benefit from an introduction of this novel methodology: by now, the majority of genetically defined leukaemia subtypes has been accurately reproduced on the basis of distinct gene expression patterns by various independent research groups. Moreover, classification of histomorphologically overlapping lymphoma subentities (e.g. Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL), was considerably improved by GEP. Beyond that, differential gene expression has provided the basis for assays being able to predict prognosis of individual patients as well as the response to specific treatment approaches, e.g. to lenalidomide in MDS. In a high proportion of Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients, prognostically adverse deletions of the IKZF1 gene coding for a specific transcription factor were identified with GEP analysis, which revealed new insights in the clinical variability of this disorder. Given these advantages of GEP, the introduction of this methodology in current diagnostic algorithms of haematological malignancies should further be validated in clinical studies.\n",
      "Acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) is a useful model for generalized malignant disease. Haemopoiesis in AML is clonal; a characteristic cell population (blast cells) has been identified and can be grown in culture. The population is organized as a hierarchy, headed by self-renewing stem cells. Several control mechanisms affect the behaviour of these stem cells. Two classes of regulatory receptors are identified that act by ligand-receptor interaction; in one class the receptors are intracellular, in the other they are in the cell membrane. It is proposed that the many regulatory signals received by blast cells contribute to a genetically determined regulatory milieu that sets the probabilities of blast stem cell renewal and differentiation. Interactions have been identified between regulatory mechanisms and the responses of blast stem cells to chemotherapeutic agents. It is suggested that new therapeutic options are emerging, based on the exploitation of regulatory mechanisms in conjunction with chemotherapy.\n",
      "A heterogeneous group of 11 consecutive patients with leukaemia have been transplanted successfully with allogeneic marrow depleted of T lymphocytes by soy bean lectin agglutination and neuraminidase-treated sheep erythrocyte rosetting. Effective depletion was achieved, leaving less than 1% of donor T lymphocytes. Despite the small numbers of nucleated cells infused (mean 0.14 X 10(8)/kg) there was only moderately delayed recovery of peripheral blood counts and no graft failures have occurred. Standard methotrexate prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was also employed in the first four transplants. Only one case of mild grade I (skin only) acute GVHD has occurred and there has been no chronic GVHD to date. The group of patients show an actuarial cumulative survival of 55% with two early infective deaths (days 42 and 44 post-transplant) and three late deaths, two with leukaemic relapse and the third with probable viral encephalitis. The longest survivor is now 1109 days post-transplant. This series indicates that lectin fractionation of donor marrow, previously employed mainly in children, can also be effective in minimizing GVHD in adults without endangering successful engraftment.\n",
      "Children with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (ML-DS), particularly megakaryoblastic leukaemia, which is clonally -related to the neonatal myeloproliferative syndrome, Transient Abnormal Myelopoiesis (TAM) unique to infants with DS. Molecular, biological, and clinical data indicate that TAM is initiated before birth when fetal liver haematopoietic cells trisomic for chromosome 21 acquire mutations in GATA1. TAM usually resolves spontaneously by 6 months; however 20-30% subsequently develop ML-DS harbouring the same GATA1 mutation(s). This review focuses on recent studies describing haematological, clinical and biological features of TAM and discusses approaches to diagnose, treat and monitor minimal residual disease in TAM. An important unanswered question is whether ML-DS is always preceded by TAM as it may be clinically and possibly haematologically ilent'. We have briefly discussed the role of population-based screening for TAM and development of treatment strategies to eliminate the preleukaemic TAM clone, thereby preventing ML-DS.\n",
      "The modern approach to therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in children began in the late 80 and in the MRC series led to a 30% improvement in survival, up to levels of about 50%. Since 1995 the most recent trial AML 12 has taken those figures to two thirds event free survival and similar overall survival. Resistant disease rates remain at 4% overall but the death rate in complete remission has fallen from 11% to 6% despite increasing intensity of therapy, and due to advances in supportive care including nutrition and antibiotics/antifungals. However, although relapse rates have continued to fall, the biggest challenge is to reduce the currently one third relapse rate. We are much better at predicting who is likely to relapse, based mainly on primary resistance to therapy and karyotype. Analysis of 629 out of the last 808 cases in whom cytogenetic testing was successful (78%) has shown very clearly that t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16) are independent good risk features. Additionally, loss of a sex chromosome in the 8;21 group defines a group which does exceptionally well, with 93% EFS at 5 years. Chromosome 7 abnormalities also remain of independent prognostic significance when age, WHO classification and white cell count are taken into account, with monosomy 7 doing even worse than 7q abnormalities. The current trial MRC AML 15 investigates the role of fludarabine--idarubicin combination therapy in the induction courses and the role of high dose cytarabine during consolidation; the aim being to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity, particularly that involving the heart. New approaches such as targeted antibody therapy will be explored when toxicity data for children permits.\n",
      "An ELISA for detecting antibody to the bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) core protein p24 is described. The test uses p24 antigen purified from concentrated cell culture supernate by lectin-affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The sensitivity and specificity of the p24-ELISA for diagnosing BLV infection relative to the gp51 agar gel immunodiffusion test, were 98.1 and 96.7%, respectively. In the event of widespread use of gp51 based vaccines, the p24-ELISA should differentiate effectively between naturally infected and vaccinated animals.\n",
      "Hepatosplenic candidiasis following granulocytopenic periods is a relatively recently recognised problem in immunocompromised patients, particularly in those with acute leukaemia. We present three patients in whom diagnosis of hepatosplenic candidiasis was suspected on the basis of ultrasonographic (US), computed tomographic (CT) findings and confirmed by laparoscopy and biopsy of liver lesions. All three patients were successfully treated briefly with amphotericin B, followed by a longer period of fluconazole. In one patient laparotomy and surgical evacuation of abscesses was performed. This condition could be more often recognised by careful follow-up of liver function test, C-reactive protein level, ultrasonography, CT and MRI after recovery from chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.\n",
      "Immunotherapy with recombinant human Interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) was given to nine patients in first complete remission from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Five patients relapsed. The median time to relapse after commencing rhIL-2 was 26 weeks (range 2-44). Four patients were studied at relapse. The morphological and cytochemical features at relapse and presentation were similar. Cytogenetic analysis at relapse in patients 1 and 3 showed a normal karyotype. At relapse, patient 4 had the abnormality 46,XY, t(2;3). Patient 2 had the chromosomal abnormality t(8;21) at presentation and relapse. Patients 3 and 4 with M5 AML relapsed rapidly at 2 and 9 weeks after starting rhIL-2 treatment. Relapse leukaemia cells had features normally associated with lymphoid development. Patient 3 was TdT positive, with rearranged immunoglobulin genes, and a proportion of cells expressing the CD7 antigen; patient 4 also expressed the CD7 antigen. Relapse leukaemic cells from three of four patients expressed the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor as assessed by flow cytometry. After overnight incubation and removal of T-lymphocytes the proportion of cells from these patients expressing the alpha chain increased from 15% to 61% (P less than 0.01). Using tritiated thymidine uptake to assess cell proliferation, two of three patients who expressed the IL-2 receptor alpha chain proliferated in response to 1000 u/ml of rhIL-2 in vitro, with a stimulation index greater than 1.95 (P less than 0.05). Following rhIL-2 immunotherapy for AML, relapse cells may express an inducible form of the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor, which can mediate a proliferative response. It is possible that rhIL-2 when administered to AML patients in remission, may induce relapse. This may be a particular risk in patients with the M5 subtype.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a molecularly and clinically heterogeneous disease. Targeted sequencing efforts have identified several mutations with diagnostic and prognostic values in KIT, NPM1, CEBPA and FLT3 in both adult and paediatric AML. In addition, massively parallel sequencing enabled the discovery of recurrent mutations (i.e. IDH1/2 and DNMT3A) in adult AML. In this study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 22 paediatric AML patients revealed mutations in components of the cohesin complex (RAD21 and SMC3), BCORL1 and ASXL2 in addition to previously known gene mutations. We also revealed intratumoural heterogeneities in many patients, implicating multiple clonal evolution events in the development of AML. Furthermore, targeted deep sequencing in 182 paediatric AML patients identified three major categories of recurrently mutated genes: cohesion complex genes [STAG2, RAD21 and SMC3 in 17 patients (8·3%)], epigenetic regulators [ASXL1/ASXL2 in 17 patients (8·3%), BCOR/BCORL1 in 7 patients (3·4%)] and signalling molecules. We also performed WES in four patients with relapsed AML. Relapsed AML evolved from one of the subclones at the initial phase and was accompanied by many additional mutations, including common driver mutations that were absent or existed only with lower allele frequency in the diagnostic samples, indicating a multistep process causing leukaemia recurrence.\n",
      "A three-month-old female Holstein-Friesian calf was presented with acute tetraparesis. After neurological examination a multifocal lesion in the central nervous system was suspected with the most pronounced lesions between the third thoracic and the third lumbar vertebrae. Haematological examination revealed moderate anaemia as well as severe thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and leucocytosis. A blood smear and bone marrow aspirate exhibited predominantly blasts with basophilic granulation leading to a diagnosis of acute (myeloid) leukaemia with involvement of the basophilic lineage or an acute basophilic leukaemia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed spinal cord compression; at necropsy, extensive localised haemorrhages extending into the thoracic vertebral canal were found. Histopathology revealed a large population of blast cells in several tissues including the meninges. Due to multifocal detection of neoplastic cells in the vascular system, neoplasia of the haematopoietic system was assumed in agreement with haematological findings. Signs of paresis could be explained by intramedullary spinal cord haemorrhage and myeloid infiltrations of meningeal vessels. In conclusion, despite its rarity, acute myeloid leukaemia with involvement of the basophilic lineage may be considered in diagnosing calves with progressive deteriorating general condition, paresis, leucocytosis with moderate basophilic differentiation or haemorrhagic disorders.\n",
      "In the 1960s, stories of children fighting cancer, previously absent from the British news, started to feature ever more prominently in the national press. Conventional treatments could not keep children alive for many months, so the promise of a cure through the use of an alternative anti-cancer erum' was not easily dismissed as quackery. The Ministry of Health and cancer research organisations struggled to find a fair and honest way to inform the public and affected families about childhood leukaemia without raising or crushing hope.\n",
      "A case story is presented, describing a 46 y old man, with a relapsing hairy cell leukaemia. After treatment with monoclonal anti CD-20 antibodies (rituximab) 375mg/week, four times, a complete remission was obtained which has lasted >9 months. The rituximab treatment produced a better remission than earlier treatments with alpha-interferon and chlorodeoxyadenosine. In addition, in contrast to other treatments, no initial worsening of the pancytopenia was observed.\n",
      "Leukaemia is a malignant disease of the blood. Current treatments for leukaemia are associated with serious side-effects. Plant-derived polyphenols have been identified as potent anti-cancer agents and have been shown to work synergistically with standard chemotherapy agents in leukaemia cell lines. Polyphenols have multiple mechanisms of action and have been reported to decrease cell proliferation, arrest cell cycle and induce apoptosis via the activation of caspase (3, 8 and 9); the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c. Polyphenols have been shown to suppress activation of transcription factors, including NF-kB and STAT3. Furthermore, polyphenols have pro-oxidant properties, with increasing evidence that polyphenols inhibit the antioxidant activity of glutathione, causing oxidative DNA damage. Polyphenols also induce autophagy-driven cancer cell death and regulate multidrug resistance proteins, and thus may be able to reverse resistance to chemotherapy agents. This review examines the molecular mechanism of action of polyphenols and discusses their potential therapeutic targets. Here, we discuss the pharmacological properties of polyphenols, including their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-tumour activities, and suggest that polyphenols are potent natural agents that can be useful therapeutically; and discuss why data on bioavailability, toxicity and metabolism are essential to evaluate their clinical use.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is characterised by accumulation of CD5(+) monoclonal B cells in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues. Genetic defects and stimuli originating from the microenvironment concur to the selection and expansion of the malignant clone. Several lines of evidence, including molecular and functional analysis of the monoclonal immunoglobulin, support the hypothesis that stimulation through the B-cell receptor affects life and death of leukaemic cells. The microenvironment also has a critical role in the survival and accumulation of leukaemic cells within lymphoid organs where signals delivered from the surrounding cells are likely crucial in inducing proliferation. Nevertheless, several major biological issues still remain to be solved including regulation of the balance between proliferation and survival of leukaemic cells and the links between emerging gene abnormalities and microenvironment. In this context, mouse models are helpful tools in understanding disease mechanisms and in evaluating the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Despite the putative intrauterine origins of childhood (0-14 years) leukaemia, it is complex to assess the impact of perinatal factors on disease onset. Results on the association of maternal history of fetal loss (miscarriage/stillbirth) with specific disease subtypes in the subsequent offspring are in conflict. We sought to investigate whether miscarriage and stillbirth may have different impacts on the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and of its main immunophenotypes (B-cell and T-cell ALL), as contrasted to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS: One thousand ninety-nine ALL incidents (957 B-ALL) and 131 AML cases along with 1:1 age and gender-matched controls derived from the Nationwide Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies and Brain Tumors (1996-2013) were studied. Multivariable regression models were used to assess the roles of previous miscarriage(s) and stillbirth(s) on ALL (overall, B-, T-ALL) and AML, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Statistically significant exposure and disease subtype-specific associations of previous miscarriage(s) exclusively with AML [odds ratio (OR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 2.81] and stillbirth(s) with ALL [OR 4.82, 95% CI 1.63, 14.24] and B-ALL particularly, emerged. CONCLUSION: Differential pathophysiological pathways pertaining to genetic polymorphisms or cytogenetic aberrations are likely to create hostile environments leading either to fetal loss or the development of specific leukaemia subtypes in subsequent offspring, notably distinct associations of maternal miscarriage history confined to AML and stillbirth history confined to ALL (specifically B-ALL). If confirmed and further supported by studies revealing underlying mechanisms, these results may shed light on the divergent leukemogenesis processes.\n",
      "A historical review of gains in the body of knowledge on chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) reveals a continuous, steady process from the beginning of the century with the pioneering work of scholars to the present era of molecular biology. Several notable hallmarks of this progress have been recognized: (1) the early period of broad, loose grouping of all chronic lymphoproliferative disorders; (2) recognition of CLL as a discrete entity with clinical and cytological identification of different forms of lymphoid neoplasm; (3) development of clinical staging systems and prognostic factors; and (4) use of immunological techniques in the study of CLL. Studies currently in progress using molecular genetic techniques hold promise for future advances in unravelling the biology of leukaemic transformation of lymphocytes in CLL.\n",
      "Moxetumomab pasudotox (Lumoxiti®), an anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin, is an important treatment option that is approved in adults with relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) who have received at least two prior lines of treatment with systemic therapies including purine nucleoside analogues. In a pivotal phase III trial, treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox resulted in approximately one third of patients achieving durable complete response lasting more than 6 months, as well as improvements in other haematological parameters and disease-related symptoms. Moxetumomab pasudotox had a generally manageable tolerability profile; the most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) included nausea, peripheral oedema, headache and pyrexia. AEs of special interest (including haemolytic uraemic syndrome and capillary leak syndrome) were generally manageable and reversible with monitoring and supportive care.\n",
      "Plain Language Summary: HCL is a rare form of leukaemia (≈ 2% of all leukaemia cases) that may cause symptoms such as anaemia, easy bruising and recurrent infection due to the low production of normal blood cells. Although treatment options are available, options are limited in patients with HCL who have relapsed (disease has reappeared after remission) or are refractory (does not respond) to treatment. Moxetumomab pasudotox (Lumoxiti®) binds to a specific protein that is overexpressed on the surface of malignant B cells, and is approved to treat adults with relapsed or refractory HCL who have been treated at least twice with systemic therapies, including a purine nucleoside analogue, for HCL. In approximately one third of patients treated with moxetumomab pasudotox, no HCL cells were found in blood or bone marrow for at least 6 months; disease-related symptoms were also improved. Moxetumomab pasudotox had a generally manageable adverse event profile. While infrequent, serious adverse events such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome and capillary leak syndrome can occur, and are generally manageable and reversible with monitoring and supportive medical care (e.g. adequate oral hydration). Thus, moxetumomab pasudotox is an important treatment option in patients with relapsed or refractory HCL who have received at least two previous treatments for HCL.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) is a quality indicator used to measure quality of care in the Netherlands. It is subject to much criticism, which was the reason to study the value of the SMR as a quality indicator for the treatment of acute leukaemia. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in patients with acute leukaemia admitted to a Santeon hospital during the period 2005-2009. SMR values were calculated and compared with the overall survival (OS). RESULTS: During the study period, 455 unique patients were admitted with acute leukaemia. SMR calculation was based on 992 admissions. SMR analysis yielded a high mortality ratio in hospital 1, 2, 3 and 4 in comparison with the national average (100), significant for hospital 1 and 4 (180 [CI 95% 126-257] and 187 [CI 95% 134-261], respectively) OS analysis also showed a significantly different outcome between hospitals. However, using OS as outcome parameter, hospital 2 and 6 showed the lowest performance as compared with hospital 1 and 4 using SMR as parameter. After multivariate analysis, age (HR 1.04; CI 95% 1.03-1.05; p < 0.001) and hospital (hospital 5 compared with 6: HR 0.54; CI 95% 0.30- .98; p = 0.043; hospital 2 compared with 1: HR 1.51; CI 95% 1.02-2.23; p = 0.039) were the only significant variables that influenced OS. CONCLUSION: Outcome according to SMR is not equivalent to outcome according to OS. This study shows that the use of the SMR as a quality indicator for the treatment of acute leukaemia does not appear to be justified.\n",
      "The bone marrow microenvironment is physiologically hypoxic with areas being as low as 1% O2, e.g. the stem cell niche. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts misuse these bone marrow niches for protection by the local microenvironment, but also might create their own microenvironment. Here we identify IL-8 as a hypoxia-regulated cytokine in both AML cell lines and primary AML samples that is induced within 48 hours of severe hypoxia (1% O2). IL-8 lacked effects on AML cells but induced migration in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), an integral part of the bone marrow. Accordingly, MSC were significantly increased in AML bone marrow as compared to healthy bone marrow. Interestingly, mononuclear cells obtained from healthy bone marrow displayed both significantly lower endogenous and hypoxia-induced production of IL-8. IL-8 mRNA expression in AML blasts from 533 patients differed between genetic subgroups with significantly lower expression of IL-8 in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), while in non APL-AML patients with FLT ITD had the highest IL-8 expression. In this subgroup, high IL-8 expression was also prognostically unfavourable. In conclusion, hypoxia as encountered in the bone marrow specifically increases IL-8 expression of AML, which in turn impacts niche formation. High IL-8 expression might be correlated with poor prognosis in certain AML subsets.\n",
      "A 58-year-old man was admitted with symptoms of lethargy and easy bruising for four months duration. Peripheral blood (PB) analysis revealed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.9 x 10(9)/l with monocytes 5.4 x 10(9)/l. Bone marrow (BM) was hypercellular with 15% blasts, monocytosis and trilineage dysplasia. Conventional cytogenetic analysis (G-banding) detected an apparently normal male karyotype (46,XY). A diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) was made. After 3 years, PB analysis revealed a WBC count of 22 x 10(9)/l and a predominance of blasts. BM aspirate analysis also revealed 89% myeloid blasts and G-banding detected the emergence of an abnormal clone harbouring an extra copy of chromosomes 13 and 15. A diagnosis of disease transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was made. Post chemotherapy BM aspirate was very hypocellular and the abnormal +13, +15 clone was still present suggesting primary refractory disease. A second course of chemotherapy was only administered for 24 hours due to complications. The abnormal +13, +15 clone was still present and it was decided that no further treatment apart from palliative care could be offered. The patient died 11 weeks later, five months after AML transformation. This is the first description of a cytogenetically normal CMML patient transforming to AML with the emergence of a unique +13, +15 double trisomy resulting in an adverse outcome.\n",
      "Patients aged 0-18 years with confirmed or possible invasive fungal infection were identified by medical record and database searches. Cases with an underlying diagnosis of acute leukaemia or following stem cell transplantation were included in a case control study. Controls included all other children with acute leukaemia or stem cell transplant in the corresponding time period. Variables collected included demographics, underlying disease risk and status, organ impairment, admission to intensive care unit, fungal infection details and certain transplant variables. Risk factors for development of invasive fungal infection were examined using logistic regression. There were 106 cases of invasive fungal infection during the study. The incidence of invasive fungal infection was 21% in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 15% in acute myeloid leukaemia and 25% following stem cell transplantation. Sixty per cent were neutropenic at diagnosis and 39% had concomitant bacteremia. High risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, relapsed disease, intensive care admission and graft-versus-host disease were significantly associated with development of invasive fungal infection on multivariate analysis. These associations provide new information on paediatric invasive fungal infections and warrant further study; caution should be encouraged when extrapolating from adult studies.\n",
      "Patients with chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukaemia are rarely cured by non-allogeneic transplant therapies. Multiple new investigational agents have become available for treatment of these patients and there are few tools to permit rational drug and clinical trial selection. In this review, we describe the chemical and biological properties of some of these agents and some of their initial clinical activity to date. The selected agents react with either cell surface molecules or signal pathway intermediates and include antibody and antibody conjugates to CD33 and CD45, a fusion protein directed to the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, an anti-sense oligonucleotide to Bcl2, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, and a protein kinase C agonist/inhibitor. The challenge for the next decade will be how to select patients for particular molecularly targeted therapeutics and how to combine these agents.\n",
      "The excess of leukaemia among young people living in the vicinity of the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield has focused attention on the possibility that irradiation of the lymphatic system from particulate alpha-emitting nuclides might be responsible. We discuss below two possible routes of such exposure; namely the inhalation and ingestion of particulates. We conclude that, in spite of the real possibility of substantial doses to tissues associated with the lymphatic system, there is little reason to expect that lymphatic leukaemia will be the dominant outcome of the exposure. However, the arguments presented are not, and cannot be, wholly conclusive.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survival estimates from developing nations are rare. METHODS: Using the US SEER and the Manila and Rizal Cancer Registry databases in the Philippines, 5-year survival for childhood leukaemia and lymphoma in 2001-2005 among Asian Americans were compared with both Filipinos and Caucasians in the United States. Estimates for patients in the United States in earlier time periods were compared with that of Philippine residents to estimate delay in achievements of comparable levels of survival. RESULTS: Childhood leukaemia and lymphoma relative survival was much lower in Filipinos living in the Philippines (32.9 and 47.7%) than in Asian Americans (80.1 and 90.5%) and Caucasians (81.9 and 87%). Achievement of comparable survival rates of Philippine residents lagged behind by 20 to >30 years compared with patients in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The large differences in survival estimates of US populations and Philippine residents highlight the deficiencies of paediatric cancer care delivery in the Philippines. The long survival lag underlines the need for major improvements in access to diagnostic and treatment facilities.\n",
      "During a 13-year period, 5200 autografts, 1039 HLA-identical sibling transplants without acute or chronic graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and 67 twins were reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation EBMT. Follow-up time was a median of 32 months. Diagnoses were acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, 4521) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, 1785) in first complete remission. The probability of relapse at 5 years was 51 +/- 1% in the autografts, 45 +/- 8% in the twins and 34 +/- 2% among the HLA-identical siblings (auto vs. sibs, P < 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, the following factors were significantly associated with an increased risk of relapse: ALL vs. AML M3 [relapse rate (RR) 2.29, P < 0.0001], AML non-M3 vs. AML M3 (RR 1.8, P < 0.0001), autograft vs. sibling transplant (RR 1.76, P < 0.0001), interval diagnosis to transplantation < 261 d (RR 1.45, P < 0.001) and other conditioning vs. total body irradiation (RR 1.16, P = 0.001). Transplant-related mortality was the same in the three groups at approximately 10% at 2 years. Five-year leukaemia-free survival was 42 +/- 1% in the autografts, 44 +/- 8% in the twins and 58 +/- 2% among the siblings (auto vs. sibs, P < 0.0001). The factors significant for relapse were also significant in multivariate analyses for leukaemia-free survival. In addition, children had a significantly better leukaemia-free survival than adults (RR 0.82, P < 0.0001). Recipients of bone marrow from HLA-identical siblings without GVHD had a lower risk of relapse and a better leukaemia-free survival than recipients of autografts. This may be as a result of a graft-vs.-leukaemia effect in the absence of GVHD.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Bone marrow and blood stem cell transplantation is now used as curative therapy for a range of haematological malignancies and other conditions. The Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry (ABMTRR) has recorded transplant activity in Australia since 1992; transplant centres in New Zealand have corresponded with the Registry since 1998. AIM: To describe allogeneic and autologous bone marrow and blood stem cell transplantation activity and outcomes in Australia and New Zealand from 1992 to 2001. METHODS: Each haemopoietic stem cell transplant centre in Australia and New Zealand contributes information to the Registry via a single information form compiled when a transplant is performed. An annual follow-up request is then sent from the Registry to the contributing centre at the anniversary of each individual transplant. RESULTS: Haemopoietic stem cell transplants in Australia have increased in number from 478 in 1992 to 937 in 2001, whereas in New Zealand the number has grown from 91 in 1998 to 105 in 2001, mainly as a result of an increase in autologous blood stem cell transplants. The number of hospitals contributing to the ABMTRR has grown from 20 in 1992 to 37 in 2001. The most common indication for autologous transplantation in 2001 was non-Hodgkin lymphoma, whereas for allogeneic transplants it was acute myeloid leukaemia. The 9-year actuarial disease-free survival probability for patients aged 16 and above between 1992 and 2000 was 37% for autologous, 39% for allogeneic related donor and 30% for allogeneic unrelated donor transplants. Recurrence of the underlying disease was the main cause of death post-transplant after both allogeneic (26.3% of deaths in the first year and 68.0% of deaths in the second year) and autologous transplants (59.0% and 86.2%). Treatment-related mortality was 16.9% after allogeneic transplantation and 2.1% after autologous transplantation in 2000. CONCLUSIONS: The ABMTRR provides a comprehensive source of information on the use of bone marrow transplant, and allows for continuing analysis of changes in the application of this high-cost technology and the outcome of patients undergoing these procedures. Registry data provide a means for directing future clinical research into perceived areas of priority for improvement of outcome, such as the reduction in the risk of disease recurrence post-transplant.\n",
      "Hairy-cell leukaemia (HCL) has long been recognized as distinct from other chronic B-cell malignancies, but several questions remain unanswered. What is the HCL cell of origin? Why does HCL lack the hallmarks of most mature B-cell tumours (for example, chromosomal translocations and consistent lymph node involvement) and show unique features like 'hairy' morphology and bone-marrow fibrosis? Gene-expression profiling and other studies have recently provided new insights into HCL biology and have the potential to affect clinical practice.\n",
      "When treating stroke as a medical emergency, more uncommon causes should be carefully and promptly considered, since timing may be crucial not only to any neuroprotective and particularly thrombolytic therapy but also to the management of an underlying life-threatening disease. This issue is illustrated in the report of an apparently extremely rare case in which an infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery was the presenting symptom of acute promyelocytic leukaemia with associated disseminated intravascular coagulation, which we believe highlights the imperative need of immediate haematological tests on all acute stroke patients.\n",
      "Current guidelines recommend that a rapid test be used to assist diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), but the choice of an assay is discretionary. PML immunofluorescence (PML IF) identifies the microparticulate pattern of the PML protein localisation, highly specific for APL. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical utility of PML IF in a real-life setting based on a retrospective records review for all patients who had PML IF performed in our centre between 2000 and 2017. Final analysis included 151 patients, 70 of whom had APL. PML IF was reported on average 3 days faster than cytogenetics. Compared with genetic results, PML IF showed sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100%. PML IF accurately predicted APL in four APL cases with cryptic karyotype/FISH and excluded APL in 98% cases tested based on the suspicious immunophenotype alone, 21/28 of whom had mutated NPM1. Results of PML IF influenced decision to start ATRA in 25 (36%) APL patients and led to its termination in six non-APL patients. In conclusion, PML IF is a fast and reliable test that facilitates accurate treatment decisions when APL is suspected. This performance of PML IF remains hard to match in a real-life setting.\n",
      "We report three cases of typical aplastic anaemia (AA) associated with a Philadelphia chromosome. This translocation was detected at the time of diagnosis of AA (one patient) and when overt leukaemia was diagnosed (two patients: one chronic myeloid leukaemia and one acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) after AA therapy and recovery of blood counts. We discuss the literature arguments about considering some cases of AA as preleukaemic disorders and suggest that our cases illustrate the association of AA with a clonal malignant disorder. We conclude that cytogenetic analysis is necessary at diagnosis of AA or after recovery of blood counts.\n",
      "In haematology practice, patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are generally assessed for frailty only if they are older and not able to tolerate intensive and remission targeted treatments. We aimed to focus on frailty in patients with AML, in all ages and aimed to evaluate its role and practicality in daily routine. Data of patients diagnosed and treated for AML between 2006 and 2016 are recorded and assessed for their survival predictivity. One hundred and ninety-seven patients were <65 years of age and 175 were ≥65. Majority of the younger patients showed ECOG 2 performance (119, 60.4%). Combined with ECOG scale, G8 scale showed survival predictivity in younger patients as well as older patients. Nutritional status showed a strong predictivity in younger patients while remained insignificant in older patients. VES13 scale showed similar predictivity strength for survival in both age groups (p = .001). Young AML patients should be thoroughly evaluated as older patients. ECOG performance evaluation should be supported with further scales. Young patients with lower ECOG scores may be regarded as vulnerable with scales embracing dimensions such as nutrition, perception of disease, depression and cognition. Nutrition should be within the main goals of intensive treatment and is related with survival.\n",
      "The first consistent karyotypic abnormality found to be associated with neoplastic disease was the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome (Nowell & Hungerford, 1960). Furthermore, the best-studied example of translocation-mediated gene activation occurs in leukaemia patients bearing this abnormality (reviewed by Kurzrock et al, 1988). In these individuals, the Ph translocation (t(9;22)(q34;q11)) results in transposition of the ABL proto-oncogene from chromosome 9q34 to 22q11, where it is fused with part of the BCR gene. It is now known that as a result of the Ph translocation, p160BCR and p145ABL (the normal BCR and ABL gene products) are replaced by p210BCR-ABL. This aberrant protein constitutes the molecular fingerprint of CML. The enhanced tyrosine phosphokinase enzymatic activity (a property possessed by some growth factor receptors and transformation-inducing oncogenes) of p210BCR-ABL implicates a direct role for this molecule in the pathogenesis of CML. Because the Ph translocation is present in the early chronic phase, the union of the BCR and ABL genes is probably involved in the initiation of the leukaemic process. The secondary molecular forces driving progression of CML to blast crisis are however unknown, and may differ from patient to patient. Approximately 10% of CML patients lack a Ph chromosome. One-half of these individuals have bcr rearrangement and express p210BCR-ABL. Ph+ and Ph- bcr+ (p210+) CML are identical and should be treated the same. Molecular follow-up of diploid bcr+ CML patients is essential for detection of persistent malignancy after therapy. The presence of a specific marker--the BCR-ABL message--permits the development of new diagnostic approaches for CML. For instance, detection of a BCR-ABL message with the use of the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction, a technique capable of detecting up to one leukaemia cell amongst one million normal cells, yields important information about minimal residual disease. Finally, the use of therapy directed against the BCR-ABL product may be a worthwhile strategy which deserves investigation, and may prompt a new era of tumour-specific treatment.\n",
      "Anti-tumour activity of triazene compounds of clinical interest [i.e. dacarbazine and temozolomide (TMZ)] relies mainly on the generation of methyl adducts to purine bases of DNA. Two DNA repair enzyme systems, i.e. the O6-guanine-alkyl-transferase (MGMT) and mismatch repair (MMR), play a predominant role in conditioning the cytotoxic effects of triazenes. In particular, high levels of MGMT associated with target cells are responsible of resistance to triazenes. On the contrary, the presence of MMR is required for the cytotoxic effects of these compounds. Previous studies performed by our group and a more recent clinical investigation reported by Karen Seiter, pointed out that triazene compounds could play an important role in the treatment of refractory acute leukaemia. Leukaemia blasts, especially of lymphoblastic leukaemia, show frequently high levels of MGMT activity. Therefore, it reasonable to hypothesize that combined treatment of leukaemia patients with triazene compounds along with MGMT inhibitors could lead to a better control of the disease. PaTrin-2 (O6-(4-bromothenyl)guanine, PAT) is a potent and scarcely toxic MGMT inhibitor recently introduced in clinical trials. This drug is used in combination with triazene compounds in order to augment their anti-tumour efficacy against neoplastic cells endowed with high MGMT activity. The present report describes, for the first time, pre-clinical in vitro studies on the cytotoxic activity of combined treatment with PAT+TMZ against long-term cultured leukaemia cells and primary leukaemia blasts obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or acute myeloblastic leukaemia. The results point out that, both in long-term cultured leukaemia cell lines and in primary blast samples, PAT could improve dramatically the sensitivity of malignant cells to the cytotoxic effects of TMZ. This sensitizing effect is detectable when leukaemia cells show resistance mechanisms based on a MGMT-proficient phenotype. On the contrary, when resistance to TMZ is dependent on MMR deficiency, no influence of PAT can be detected in various experimental conditions. In conclusion, these results appear to provide disease-oriented rational basis to design novel clinical protocols for the treatment of acute leukaemia with combined administration of PAT and triazene compounds.\n",
      "The purpose of this literature review was to identify and summarize published studies describing the epidemiology and management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia represents 22-30% of all leukaemia cases with a worldwide incidence projected to be between < 1 and 5.5 per 100,000 people. Australia, the USA, Ireland and Italy have the highest CLL incidence rates. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia presents in adults, at higher rates in males than in females and in whites than in blacks. Median age at diagnosis is 64-70 years. Five-year survival rate in the USA is 83% for those < 65 years old and 68% for those 65 + years old. Hereditary and genetic links have been noted. Persons with close relatives who have CLL have an increased risk of developing it themselves. No single environmental risk factor has been found to be predictive for CLL. Patients are usually diagnosed at routine health care visits because of elevated lymphocyte counts. The most common presenting symptom of CLL is lymphadenopathy, while difficulty exercising and fatigue are common complaints. Most patients do not receive treatment after initial diagnosis unless presenting with clear pathologic conditions. Pharmacological therapy may consist of monotherapy or combination therapy involving glucocorticoids, alkylating agents, and purine analogs. Fludarabine may be the most effective single drug treatment currently available. Combination therapy protocols have not been shown to be more effective than fludarabine alone. As no cure is yet available, a strong unmet medical need exists for innovative new therapies. Experimental treatments under development include allogeneic stem cell transplant, mini-allogeneic transplants, and monoclonal antibodies (e.g. alemtuzumab against CD52; rituximab against CD20).\n",
      "The blast cells from up to 70% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia exhibit a variable degree of autonomous growth in vitro, which is related to the production of autocrine growth factors. It has recently been established that patients with autonomous blast cell growth have both a lower remission rate and a higher relapse rate, compared to otherwise comparable patients whose blasts exhibit non-autonomous in vitro growth. In a group of 50 patients the actuarial disease-free survival for the autonomous growth group was 11% at 5 years compared to greater than 50% for the non-autonomous growth group. This data suggests that AML blasts with autocrine growth characteristics may be resistant to cytotoxic drug therapy. Here we present further data demonstrating that AML blasts with autonomous growth are relatively resistant to the induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) and that this is related to the autocrine production of GM-CSF. Also AML blasts with autonomous growths have aberrant expression of genes associated with resistance to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic drugs. These include high expression of the bcl-2 oncoprotein and abnormalities of expression of the p53 tumour suppressor gene. Furthermore bcl-2 expression was found to be unregulated by both exogenous and autocrine GM-CSF suggesting that the documented negative prognostic effect of autonomous growth on treatment outcome in AML, is in part due to the regulatory effect of autocrine GM-CSF on bcl-2 expression, thus protecting cells from apoptosis induced by cytotoxic drug therapy.\n",
      "Bone marrow transplantation is an expensive treatment, rationed primarily by the availability of donors. Recruiting potential unrelated bone marrow donors to a register would add not only to the cost, but also to the volume, of transplantation. Proposals to establish such registries have thus been subject to rigorous financial scrutiny. In Australia, 3 alternative estimates suggest that approximately 200 patients, otherwise suitable for bone marrow transplantation, do not receive transplants because they have no suitable related donor. The population of Australia is approximately 16 million. The alternatives for these patients are thus chemotherapy or unrelated bone marrow transplantation. The costs of chemotherapy and transplantation have been directly compared in 1 trial of treatment for acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia. The cost per year of life saved was approximately the same for the 2 treatments, with better patient survival from transplantation. The estimated cost difference in both the United States and Australia, between the policy extremes of no patients transplanted, and all transplanted, was between 1.3-2.4% of the total costs of managing these patients. The cost of searching existing registers for unrelated donors for Australian patients, averages A$24,000-28,000 to the point of a successful donor procedure. The cost of establishing and maintaining an Australian Register of a size predicted to find donors for half of the potential recipients, has been estimated at A$ 10,000 per donor procedure. The decision to proceed with unrelated bone marrow transplantation commits resources that are currently used by the alternative therapies. It is thus important to monitor both the costs and effects of the new approach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Axl is a receptor tyrosine kinase promoting anti-apoptosis, invasion and mitogenesis, and is highly expressed in different solid cancers. Axl basal transcriptional activity is driven by Sp1/Sp3, and overexpression of MZF-1 (myeloid zinc-finger 1) induces Axl transcription and gene expression. Furthermore, Axl expression is epigenetically controlled by CpG hypermethylation; however, little is known about inducible Axl gene expression and Axl regulation in haematopoetic malignancies. RESULTS: In the present study, we studied Axl transcriptional regulation under PMA-stimulated conditions in leukaemia cells. Luciferase analysis with sequential 5'-deletion constructs revealed that the -660/-580 region of the Axl promoter is indispensable for induced promoter activity under PMA stimulation. This region includes AP-1 (activator protein 1)/CREB [CRE (cAMP-response-element)-binding protein] motifs, five times partially overlapping TGCGTG repeats and multiple GT repeats. Mutational, supershift and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) analysis determined that AP-1 family members bind to AP-1 motifs and to the 5 × TGCGTG overlapping repeats, thus transactivating Axl promoter activity. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of PKC (protein kinase C), ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and p38 reduced Axl expression. Additionally, mithramycin treatment abolished constitutive and PMA-induced Axl expression. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together the results of the present study suggest that PMA-induced Axl gene expression in leukaemia cells is mediated by AP-1 motifs and 5 × TGCGTG repeats within the promoter region -660/-580, and through the PKC/ERK1/2/AP-1 or PKC/p-38/AP-1 signalling axis.\n",
      "Cancer incidence in 1990-92 among English south Asian (residents with ethnic origins in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh) and non-south Asian children is compared. Standardized incidence ratios show significant overall excesses in south Asians (131), largely due to higher rates in south Asian boys, and specific excesses for leukaemia (141), lymphoid leukaemia (141), lymphoma (172) and hepatic tumours (375). Aetiological investigation is required.\n",
      "Haptoglobin and transferrin (TF) types were determined for 134 patients with leukaemia of the four most common types: acute lymphocytic (ALL), chronic lymphocytic (CLL), acute myelocytic (AML) and chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML). The phenotype HP1 was found to have an increased incidence in the total patient group due to an increased incidence in those with AML, ALL and CML compared with controls, but not in those with CLL. Although tests of association applied to each of the samples of the four common types of leukaemia produced no significant chi 2 values, they did indicate that the relative incidence (RI) was just under 2 for the groupings of the acute forms ALL and AML, the myelocytic forms AML and CML and for the combination of ALL, AML and CML, respectively. All these associations were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Analysis of TF subtypes and leukaemia indicated a significantly increased frequency of TF C1C1 among leukaemia patients compared with controls (p less than 0.005). Analysis of the samples of each of the four common types suggested that while the RI was raised in all but ALL patients, the association was significant only in AML patients (p less than 0.05). However, when the two myelocytic types were combined the RI was 2.3 and the association was highly significant (p less than 0.005). No such association could be detected in the lymphocytic forms.\n",
      "Growth factor-independent 1B (GFI1B) is a transcription factor essential for the development and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. We evaluated the GFI1B expression in erythroleukaemia and megakaryocytic leukaemia, as well as in patients with other subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), severe aplastic anaemia (SAA), myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) and in healthy volunteers. GFI1B expression was increased at least threefold in patients with erythroleukaemia (P < 0.01 compared with controls) and megakaryocytic leukaemia (P < 0.05) as well as in their corresponding leukaemic cell lines HEL, K562, CMK and M-07e. Patients with undifferentiated or monocytic AML, ALL, MMM, MDS and CML had no significantly altered GFI1B expression, whereas GFI1B expression was decreased 10-fold in patients with SAA (P < 0.0001 compared with controls). Silencing GFI1B by transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the proliferation rate in the leukaemic cell lines HEL, K562 and NB4 (P < 0.01). Concomitantly, we observed a two- to threefold increase in the apoptosis rate in these cells after transfection with siRNA towards GFI1B. Our data indicate that GFI1B plays a major role in AML-M6 and AML-M7 and qualifies as a target for anti-leukaemic strategies in these malignancies.\n",
      "Relapse is one of the main problems which can occur following allogeneic transplantation for haematological malignancies. In this situation the enhancement of the graft-versus-leukaemia effect by transfusion of donor buffy coats with or without cytokines may lead to complete remission especially in myeloid leukaemias. FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) is a sensitive method to monitor chimaerism in gender-different transplantation. We report a case of successful buffy coat transfer therapy > 9 years after bone marrow transplantation. This is the longest interval reported, to our knowledge, between transplantation to relapse, which was treated by adoptive immunotherapy. Complete donor chimaerism was confirmed by FISH.\n",
      "CD45 isoform expression was studied in 204 cases of B-cell lymphoproliferative disease, including 162 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In almost half the samples tested, CD45R0 was co-expressed with CD45RA, unlike normal B-cells, which express only CD45RA, except at terminal stages of differentiation. In a small number of cases CD45R0 was the dominant isoform expressed. No correlation could be discerned either with Binet or RAI staging in CLL or with disease type CLL, prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) or hairy cell leukaemia (HCL). Comparison of CD45 isoform expression with other markers showed no correlation with apparent maturational status of the cells involved.\n",
      "Minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML-M0) may pose difficulty in diagnosis since morphological criteria alone are not reliable. Other studies such as electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and surface marker analysis are needed. The role of cytochemistry has been limited to the negative staining of blasts for Sudan Black B and myeloperoxidase. An abnormal morphology and cytochemistry of bone marrow maturing cells may indicate the myeloid nature of acute leukaemia. In this case of AML-M0, increased numbers of maturing and mature bone marrow granulocytic cells staining simultaneously for both specific and non-specific esterase (double esterase) are described. In acute leukaemia, this abnormal cytochemical finding seems to be specific for myeloid leukaemia and may be used as supplementary evidence of myeloid differentiation of morphologically undifferentiated blasts in cases of AML-M0.\n",
      "In the European LeukemiaNet favourable risk category, allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is not indicated in first complete remission for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with NPM1 mutations (ELNfav NPM1 AML), although a proportion of these patients will relapse. Given the prognostic importance of measurable residual disease (MRD), CETLAM-12 considered a pre-emptive intervention in patients with molecular failure (MF). We analyzed 110 ELNfav NPM1 AML patients achieving complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy. Two-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), overall survival (OS) and leukaemia-free survival (LFS) were 17%, 81·5% and 82%, respectively. Forty-six patients required additional therapy for MF (n = 33) or haematological relapse (HemR; n = 13), resulting in a molecular LFS (molLFS) and a cumulative incidence of MF at two years of 61% and 38% respectively. Two-year OS for these 46 patients was 66%, with a different outcome between patients with MF (86%) and HemR (42%) (P = 0·002). Quantitative NPM1 detection at different timepoints was predictive of molLFS; an MRD ratio (NPM1mut/ABL1 × 100) cut-off of 0·05 after first consolidation identified two cohorts with a two-year molLFS of 77% and 40% for patients below and above 0·05, respectively. In conclusion, MRD-based pre-emptive intervention resulted in a favourable outcome for ELNfav NPM1 AML patients.\n",
      "The retinoblastoma protein-interacting zinc finger gene (RIZ), a member of the nuclear protein methyltransferase superfamily, is characterized by the presence of the N-terminal PR domain. The RIZ gene encodes for two proteins, RIZ1 and RIZ2. While RIZ1 contains the PR (PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homologous) domain, RIZ2 lacks it. RIZ gene expression is altered in a variety of human cancers and RIZ1 is now considered to be a candidate tumour suppressor. To investigate the role of RIZ in leukaemogenesis, we analysed the differential expression of RIZ1 and RIZ2 by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. Our results showed that the expression of RIZ1 was significantly decreased in leukaemia cell lines (14 out of 17, 82%) and in patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (eight out of 14, 57%). In contrast, RIZ2 expression was increased in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (eight out of 11, 73%), compared with normal bone marrow cells. These findings indicate that suppression of RIZ1 expression or enhancement of RIZ2 expression may have an important role in leukaemogenesis.\n",
      "Leukaemia immunotherapy represents a fascinating and promising field of translational research, particularly as an integrative approach of bone marrow transplantation. Adoptive immunotherapy by the use of donor-derived expanded leukaemia-specific T cells has showed some kind of clinical response, but the major advance is nowadays represented by gene manipulation of donor immune cells, so that they acquire strict specificity towards the tumour target and potent lytic activity, followed by significant proliferation, increased survival and possibly anti-tumour memory state. This is achieved by gene insertion of Chimeric T-cell Antigen Receptors (CARs), which are artificial molecules containing antibody-derived fragments (to bind the specific target), joined with potent signalling T-Cell Receptor (TCR)-derived domains that activate the manipulated cells. This review will discuss the main application of this approach particularly focusing on the paediatric setting, raising advantages and disadvantages and discussing relevant perspectives of use in the nearest future.\n",
      "AIMS: Aggressive natural killer (NK)-cell leukaemia (ANKCL) and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) with secondary bone marrow involvement are rare bone marrow NK/T-cell neoplasms and share similar features. This study aimed to distinguish these two entities. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied bone marrow NK/T-cell neoplasms by classifying them into those with no extramedullary mass (group 1, eight cases) and those with extramedullary mass (group 2, 13 cases). The two groups showed similar clinical presentations and pathological features. Fever and cytopenia were the most common clinical presentations in both groups. The neoplastic cells varied from small and relatively monotonous cells to large pleomorphic cells. In six cases (two in group 1, and four in group 2), the neoplastic infiltrate was inconspicuous, consisting of ≤10% of marrow cells in the interstitium, which were hardly identified by haematoxylin and eosin staining alone. Nearly all patients rapidly died, regardless of the neoplastic infiltrate volume. All of the group 1 patients fulfilled the World Health Organisation 2017 diagnostic criteria of ANKCL, and their survival was significantly worse than that of the group 2 patients (P = 0.035). In addition, there was a significant association between being in group 1 and chromosome 7 abnormalities. Chromosome 6q deletion, which is commonly reported in ENKTCL, was seen in two of our group 2 patients, and was not observed in any of our group 1 patients. CONCLUSION: ANKCL with no extramedullary mass should be distinguished from ENKTCL with bone marrow involvement, as the former shows distinct outcomes and genetic features.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that tryptase, a mast cell enzyme, is expressed in neoplastic cells in myeloid leukaemias. In several of these patients, increased serum tryptase levels are detectable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have determined serum tryptase levels in 914 patients with haematological malignancies, including myeloproliferative disorders (n = 156), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, n = 241), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 317), systemic mastocytosis (SM, n = 81), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 59) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 26). Moreover, tryptase was measured in 136 patients with non-neoplastic haematological disorders, 102 with non-haematological disorders and 164 healthy subjects. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, the median serum tryptase was 5.2 ng mL(-1). Elevated serum tryptase levels were found to cluster in myeloid neoplasm, whereas almost all patients with lymphoid neoplasms exhibited normal tryptase. Among myeloid neoplasms, elevated tryptase levels (> 15 ng mL(-1)) were recorded in > 90% of patients with SM, 38% with AML, 34% with CML and 25% with MDS. The highest tryptase levels, often > 1000 ng mL(-1), were found in advanced SM and core-binding-factor leukaemias. In most patients with non-neoplastic haematological disorders and non-haematological disorders analysed in our study, tryptase levels were normal, the exception being a few patients with end-stage kidney disease and helminth infections, in whom a slightly elevated tryptase was found. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, tryptase is a new diagnostic marker of myeloid neoplasms and a useful test in clinical haematology.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that presents with a range of morphological, cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and biomolecular features. Over the past 20 years, application of new cytogenetic and molecular techniques has greatly improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of AML, resulting in new potential therapeutic applications. However, the results of current therapy are still unsatisfactory, especially in patients who have adverse prognostic factors at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, some pivotal questions about the procedures of induction and postinduction therapy of AML remain unanswered, and substantial controversy exists on the optimum therapeutic approach for the disorder.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: To examine the association between occupation and leukaemia. METHODS: We interviewed 225 cases (aged 20-75 years) notified to the New Zealand Cancer Registry during 2003-04, and 471 controls randomly selected from the Electoral Roll collecting demographic details, information on potential confounders and a comprehensive employment history. Associations between occupation and leukaemia were analysed using logistic regression adjusted for gender, age, ethnicity and smoking. RESULTS: Elevated odds ratios (ORs) were observed in agricultural sectors including horticulture/fruit growing (OR: 2.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.51, 4.55), plant nurseries (OR: 7.51, 95% CI: 1.85, 30.38) and vegetable growing (OR: 3.14, 95% CI: 1.18, 8.40); and appeared greater in women (ORs: 4.71, 7.75 and 7.98, respectively). Elevated ORs were also observed in market farmers/crop growers (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.02), field crop/vegetable growers (OR: 3.98, 95% CI: 1.46, 10.85), market gardeners (OR: 5.50, 95% CI: 1.59, 19.02), and nursery growers/workers (OR: 4.23, 95% CI: 1.34, 13.35); also greater in women (ORs: 3.48, 7.62, 15.74 and 11.70, respectively). These elevated ORs were predominantly for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Several associations persisted after semi-Bayes adjustment. Elevated ORs were observed in rubber/plastics products machine operators (OR: 3.76, 95% CI: 1.08, 13.08), predominantly in plastic product manufacturing. CLL was also elevated in tailors and dressmakers (OR: 7.01, 95% CI: 1.78, 27.68), cleaners (OR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.00, 4.14) and builder labourers (OR: 4.03, 95% CI: 1.30, 12.53). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest increased leukaemia risks associated with certain agricultural, manufacturing, construction and service occupations in New Zealand.\n",
      "Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) and active plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) were assayed in 66 cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Significant elevation of both TAT and PIC was observed in all cases of DIC. Most elevated levels of TAT were seen in DIC with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) and sepsis. The highest levels of PIC were seen in DIC with APL but were much lower in sepsis. A significant elevation in active PAI was observed in DIC due to acute leukaemia (apart from APL), chronic myeloid leukaemia and sepsis, but not in APL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cancer. Active PAI was higher in patients with multiple organ failure (MOF) than in those without MOF while PIC was lower in patients with this complication. Thus, the balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis varied according to the underlying cause of DIC; APL had more dominant activation of fibrinolysis, while sepsis had greater activation of coagulation. It is suggested that the inhibition of secondary fibrinolytic activation plays an important role in the progression of MOF by the disturbance of the microcirculation.\n",
      "All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is used to treat patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), inducing APL cells to differentiate into abnormal neutrophils. To investigate the possible relationship between the chromosome translocation t(15;17) found in APL and ATRA treatment, the human myeloid leukaemia cell lines HL60 and NB4, that are PML-RARalpha negative and positive, respectively, were treated with ATRA and immunophenotyped using a CD antibody microarray. For HL60 cells, ATRA induced major increases in descending order of CD38, CD11b, CD45RO, CD11c, CD54 and CD36 with repression of CD117 and CD44. For NB4 cells, ATRA induced major increases in descending order of CD11c, CD54, CD11a, CD11b, CD53, CD65, CD138, CD66c and T-cell receptor alpha/beta (TCRalpha/beta), with repression of CD38 and CD9. The induction of a number of these CD antigens is consistent with the known differentiation of these leukaemias to abnormal neutrophils. Approximately half of the antigens up-regulated by ATRA on NB4 cells were adhesion molecules, including CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD54, CD66c and CD138, consistent with the increased adhesiveness of leukaemia cells observed for APL patients treated with ATRA. On HL60 cells, ATRA induced expression of CD38, CD43 and CD45RO and repressed CD117, while the converse was true on NB4 cells that contain chimeric PML-RARalpha. For NB4 cells, ATRA induced some remarkable increases in CD antigens not seen for HL60: CD14 (16.6-fold), CD32 (27.8), CD53 (20.5), CD65 (139), CD66c (79.7), CD126 (15.1), and CD138 (57.6). The expression of these antigens may be regulated by PML-RARalpha in the presence of ATRA. Such CD antigens could be targets for synergistic treatment of APL with therapeutic antibodies following ATRA treatment.\n",
      "Recent investigations have provided an increasingly complete picture of the genetic landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). These analyses revealed that the CLL genome displays a high degree of heterogeneity between patients and within the same patient. In addition, they highlighted molecular mechanisms and functionally relevant biological programmes that may be important for the pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting of this disease. This Review focuses on recent insights into the understanding of CLL biology, with emphasis on the role of genetic lesions in the initiation and clinical progression of CLL. We also consider the translation of these findings into the development of risk-adapted and targeted therapeutic approaches.\n",
      "The membrane expression of CD45RA and CD45RO on fresh leukaemic cells taken from 529 cases of acute haemopoietic malignancies, including 117 B-origin acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-origin ALL), 37 T-origin acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-origin ALL0, 297 de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 42 refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) and 36 myeloid blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML-BP-my), was analysed. B-origin ALLs were characterized by the lack of the RO isoform along with the consistent presence of RA. Conversely, a differential expression of the two isoforms was detected in different subsets of T-origin ALL, in that T-stem cell leukaemias (T-SCL: CD7+, CD4-, CD8-, CD1-) preferentially expressed CD45RA whereas conventional T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (T-ALL: CD7+, CD4+ and/or CD8+ and/or CD1+) were consistently marked by CD45RO. Within myeloid malignancies, most of AMLs displayed CD45RA, while a substantial group of CML-BP-my preferentially exhibited CD45RO. As a general rule, a reciprocal exclusion of the two isoforms was observed in AML as well as in ALL. Nevertheless, a frequent coexpression of CD45RA and CD45RO was observed in CD14+ AML. In vitro treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was able to promote a switch from CD45RA to CD45RO expression in 27 de novo AML, independently from morphological subtyping. To our knowledge, this is the first report on CD45 isoform expression in a large series of patients with acute leukaemia. The knowledge of the differential expression of CD45RA and CD45RO can ameliorate our classificative approach to haematological malignancies, as well as disclose new multiple overlap points between normal and leukaemic cell differentiation.\n",
      "During the last decade, biannual quality controls were performed in the Netherlands focusing on the immunophenotyping of leukaemic haematological malignancies. All results on 48 specimens obtained by 18-34 laboratories were analysed. The interlaboratory variability and percentages of discordant results from 30 markers were measured by assessing false positive or negative (cut-off 10%) results in comparison with median results of the group. The quality of the immunophenotypic diagnoses obtained from the interpretation of these markers in relation to clinical data was evaluated by scoring them as 'correct', 'minor fault', 'major fault', 'not based upon the markers used', and 'no diagnosis', CD3, CD8, CD19, CD61 and Sm lambda had the lowest percentage discordancy (sum of total negative and positive discordant values 5-7.5% of assays): CD13, CD15, cyCD22, CD33 and TdT scored worst with 14-20% cumulative discordancy. The analysis of each diagnosis yielded 78% acceptable immunophenotypic conclusions (correct 54% and minor fault 24%). It appeared that the major faults in immunophenotyping were caused by suboptimal antibody selection and erroneous interpretation of the results obtained, rather than by technical errors. Large differences per diagnostic category were observed, with the best scores for mature B-cell leukaemias, AMLs and common-ALL, and the poorest scores for T-cell malignancies which were correctly diagnosed in only 24-60% of specimens. Mature T-NHL and T-PLL were mistakenly diagnosed as T-ALL by 40% of the centres. Misinterpretation of TdT immunofluorescence or omitting this marker contributed significantly to these wrong diagnoses. A median of 4% of immunophenotypic diagnoses were not based on a correct panel of antibodies, but upon the morphology of the accompanying blood smear, and was often flawed by overinterpretation. In conclusion, both the technical performance of immunophenotyping of haematological malignancies in The Netherlands and the procedure by which a final diagnosis is obtained needs improvement, especially for T-cell malignancies.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Comparative assessment of the HRQL of paediatric survivors of brain tumours (BT) and of acute leukaemia against a population of their healthy peers. METHODS: The study consisted of patients who had completed treatment for BT (n=36) or acute leukaemia (n=35) and were aged between 8 and 19. Healthy children (n=60) were selected from among pupils of schools. HRQL was evaluated directly and indirectly on the basis of the Polish language version of the PedsQLTM 4.0 Generic Core scales. The influence of selected factors (sex, age, time from the end of treatment and type of treatment) on the HRQL result was analysed. RESULTS: In all the aspects analysed (total, physical, psychosocial, emotional, social and school functioning), the HRQL of BT and leukaemia survivors was significantly lower in comparison to their healthy peers. The HRQL of patients after BT treatment was also significantly lower than that of the survivors of leukaemia. The parent-proxy reported HRQL was consistent with the children selfassessment. Patients treated with radiotherapy presented a significantly lower evaluation of life quality in the physical sphere. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of HRQL should be treated as an additional independent parameter in an assessment of the long-term results of oncological treatment.\n",
      "Extra-medullary myeloid tumours (EMT) have been described after curative treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in increasing numbers after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The sites of manifestations are ubiquitous and the discovery is most frequently guided by symptoms reported by the patient or by findings on clinical examination. This study reports a case of EMT in muscles and the heart 1.5 years after allogeneic transplantation for an AML with t(8;21)(q22;23) who achieved a complete remission by use of an idarubicine-based combination chemotherapy. Pathological and imaging findings are presented and treatment options are discussed.\n",
      "Dipyridamole strongly inhibited spontaneous in vitro proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (n = 9), chronic myelogenous leukaemia in first chronic phase (n = 4) and blast phase (n = 1). Theophyllamine and verapamil also inhibited proliferation of leukaemia cells from all patients except the CML patient in blast phase where only minimal inhibition was seen. Only dipyridamole caused strong inhibition in concentrations corresponding to the therapeutic serum level, and this inhibition was not influenced by the presence of high levels of interleukin 2.\n",
      "Serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) increase during septicaemia in previously healthy individuals. To investigate whether a similar increase in TNF-alpha can be seen in severely immunocompromised patients with acute leukaemia and chemotherapy-induced leukopenia, serum TNF-alpha was analysed in leukopenic patients with bacterial infections. Pretherapy serum levels of TNF-alpha were decreased in leukaemia patients compared with healthy controls, and serum TNF-alpha levels showed a further decrease when patients developed chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. When leukopenic patients developed bacterial infections, serum concentrations of TNF-alpha increased. Serum levels of TNF-alpha decreased when clinical signs of infection resolved during antibiotic therapy, but an increase occurred later in parallel with haematopoietic reconstitution.\n",
      "We report the different presentation features and clinical outcome between two identical infant twins with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with a shared clonal disease and MLL gene rearrangement. One twin relapsed and died, but the other is in complete remission > 4 years after diagnosis. These data, and similar observations on other twin infants with leukaemia, suggest that despite a common clonal in utero, post-natally these leukaemias can evolve independently, at different rates, in the twinned individuals, and that the usually fatal leukaemia associated with t(4;11) MLL gene rearrangement can be effectively treated when the leukaemic burden is small.\n",
      "This case report describes a patient with acute myelocytic leukaemia, who developed a necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis. This is an uncommon, new form of invasive aspergillosis, which is mainly seen in the heart-lung transplantation setting and has only been reported once in another patient with leukaemia. Neither amphotericin B nor liposomal amphotericin (AmBisome) was effective. Only after the immune system had recovered did the infection disappear.\n",
      "AIM: To explore the role of phenotypic changes as possible limiting factors in the immunological detection of minimal residual disease in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS: 20 relapses were evaluated, with special attention to changes in the criteria used for the definition of a phenotype as \"aberrant\". In all cases the same monoclonal antibody and fluorochrome were used at diagnosis and in relapse. RESULTS: Six out of the 16 patients showed aberrant phenotypes at diagnosis. At relapse, no changes in the aberrant phenotypes were detected in most of the patients; nevertheless, in two of the four patients with asynchronous antigen expression this aberration disappeared at relapse. At diagnosis in both cases there were already small blast cell subpopulations showing the phenotype of leukaemic cells at relapse. Ten out of the 16 cases analysed showed significant changes in the expression of at least one of the markers analysed. CONCLUSIONS: At relapse in AML the \"leukaemic phenotypes\" usually remained unaltered, while other phenotypic features--not relevant for distinguishing leukaemic blast cells among normal progenitors--changed frequently; however, they were not a major limitation in the immunological detection of minimal residual disease.\n",
      "AIMS: Deregulation of apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancers. Inactivation of cancer cell apoptosis by somatic mutations has been reported in several cancers. Caspase-10 activation is important in the initiation phase of apoptosis. The aim of this study was to explore whether CASP10 gene that encodes caspase-10 is somatically mutated in acute adulthood leukaemias and multiple myelomas (MMs). METHODS: We analysed the entire coding region and all splice sites of CASP10 gene for the detection of somatic mutations in 60 acute leukaemias (25 acute myelogenous leukaemias, 35 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias) and 22 multiple myelomas by a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. RESULTS: Overall, we found two CASP10 mutations in the cancers (2/82; 2.4%). One mutation [c.854T>C (pLeu285Pro)] was detected in a T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) (1/13 T-ALL; 7.7%). The other mutation [c.61C>T (p.Arg21Cys)] was found in an MM (1/22 MM; 4.5%). The mutations were identified in the coding regions of the death effector domain (p.Arg21Cys) and the p17 large protease subunit (pLeu285Pro). We observed both of the T-ALL and the MM with the CASP10 mutations well expressed the mutant CAS10 at mRNA level. CONCLUSION: Although our data indicate that somatic mutation of CASP10 is not common in T-ALL and MM, the data suggest a possibility that CASP10 mutation might contribute to the pathogenesis of factions of T-ALL and MM.\n",
      "The outcome in childhood leukaemia has shown steady improvement over the last decade and efforts are now concentrated on the stratification of patients by risk factors which may avoid overtreatment of good risk patients and limit dose escalation strategies, including those with bone marrow transplantation, to the higher risk patients. In ALL, risk stratification is based on the presenting white cell count, sex, age and cytogenetics of the tumour cells. Even in acute myeloid leukaemia, the outcome with chemotherapy alone is now sufficient to limit elective allogeneic bone marrow transplantation to those who do not have cytogenetically favourable disease. In non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a dramatic improvement in overall survival from 50% to in excess of 80% has been achieved by an escalation in dose and dose intensity of chemotherapy. With this improvement, the prognostic influence of clinical staging has become less clear and recent efforts have concentrated on determining which groups of patients would be cured by less intensive treatment. As for ALL, there is concern about the potential late sequelae in these highly curable children. There remain groups of unusual tumour types, such as anaplastic large cell and peripheral T cell lymphoma, where there remains much to be learned about the pathogenesis and clinical behaviour. The optimum treatment strategy for these subgroups remains to be clarified.\n",
      "Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is established as part of the treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia, although its precise mode of action remains largely unknown. Its use in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has been limited. We have previously documented autologous cytolytic activity against AML blasts in patients after autologous bone marrow transplantation. Here we present a patient with poor-risk AML who relapsed from first complete remission (CR) and was unwilling to undergo high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. In second chemotherapy-induced CR, the patient had no evidence of antileukaemia cytolytic activity in an in vitro assay, and she commenced IFN-alpha (Roferon). She subsequently developed high levels of leukaemia-specific cytotoxicity, and has remained in second CR for two years. These findings support the use of IFN-alpha in patients with poor-risk AML, and suggest that one mechanism of action may be immunological.\n",
      "Hepatic fungal infection is a frequent complication in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. Hepatic lesions may be detected using computerised tomographic (CT) scans, but there is no standardised CT protocol for the diagnosis and follow-up of hepatic fungal infection. We therefore retrospectively analysed the number and the volume of hepatic fungal lesions in 24 CT of 20 consecutive patients treated for acute leukaemia during late-arterial and porto-venous phase. The mean number of lesions per patient was 31 (range: 3-105) in the late-arterial and 26 (3-81) in the porto-venous CT (P = 0.026). The mean total volume of all lesions was 6.45 ml in the late-arterial and 4.07 ml in the porto-venous CT representing a 1.6fold difference between the two CT scans (P = 0.008). The total volume of the lesions negatively correlated to the absolute contrast difference between liver parenchyma and liver vein (Pearson correlation, r = -0.62; P = 0.002). In conclusion, the late-arterial CT provides a superior distinction of hepatic lesions due to a delayed perfusion of the outer rim of the fungal lesions resulting in an extended visibility. The late-arterial CT is superior to the porto-venous CT for initial diagnosis and follow-up of hepatic fungal infection.\n",
      "Promoter hypermethylation-mediated inactivation of ID4 plays a crucial role in the development of solid tumours. This study aimed to investigate ID4 methylation and its clinical relevance in myeloid malignancies. ID4 hypermethylation was associated with higher IPSS scores, but was not an independent prognostic biomarker affecting overall survival (OS) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, ID4 hypermethylation correlated with shorter OS and leukaemia-free survival (LFS) time and acted as an independent risk factor affecting OS in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Moreover, ID4 methylation was significantly decreased in the follow-up paired AML patients who achieved complete remission (CR) after induction therapy. Importantly, ID4 methylation was increased during MDS progression to AML and chronic phase (CP) progression to blast crisis (BC) in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Epigenetic studies showed that ID4 methylation might be one of the mechanisms silencing ID4 expression in myeloid leukaemia. Functional studies in vitro showed that restoration of ID4 expression could inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis in both K562 and HL60 cells. These findings indicate that ID4 acts as a tumour suppressor in myeloid malignancies, and ID4 methylation is a potential biomarker in predicting disease progression and treatment outcome.\n",
      "The West Midlands Regional Children Tumour Registry collects detailed information on all cases of childhood cancer in the West Midlands Health Authority Region (WMHAR). The distribution by electoral ward of all cases diagnosed in the WMHAR between 1980 and 1984 has been determined. Analysis has also been performed for leukaemias/non-Hodgkin lymphomas alone. We suggest that this latter grouping should be universally employed, owing to the difficulty of accurately separating out cases of leukaemia. Both spatial analyses showed several wards with significantly excessive rates on the basis of their cumulative Poison probability. Observed/expected ratios of 3-35 were seen for cases in significant wards, which are similar to the ratios seen in analysis of incidence around nuclear installations. However, further detailed consideration of these individual significance levels in the light of the number of statistically significant wards which would occur by chance alone, due to the multiple use of the test, accounted completely for the number of wards obtained in each of the groups considered. Thus, apparent 'clustering' of cases could be mere statistical artefact. In the WMHAR, therefore, using the technique of probability mapping, no true spatial pattern of incidence was found, other than that which would occur by chance alone. This, in a large area without nuclear installations and an even mix of rural and industrialised regions, could be seen as control data for those studies which have considered cases of childhood leukaemia around nuclear facilities, where the observation of single point clusters associated with suspected sites restricts assessments of spatial pattern in the rest of the area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "The definition of primary refractory acute myeloid leukaemia is the failure to achieve a response after one or two cycles of induction. Given that there are many different strategies involving different doses of cytarabine and anthracyclines, which may or may not be equivalent, and as this is an area of unmet need with the potential for the development of new agents and strategies, uniform criteria for response have been described that need to be adhered to. The outcome of patients with chemoresistant disease is poor with only a proportion of patients salvaged by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Progress in supportive care strategies and donor identification has enabled more of these patients to undergo unrelated donor transplantation. Novel strategies and new agents directed at the biology of the disease and the mechanisms of resistance are needed.\n",
      "Adoptive immunotherapy with transfusion of donor lymphocytes in allogeneic stem cell chimeras has been successful in the treatment of recurrent chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and some patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The hypothesis that the graft-vs-leukaemia effect (GVL) is promoted by leukaemia-derived dendritic cells has been supported by the concurrent treatment of patients with cytokines that are known to induce differentiation of leukaemia cells towards dendritic cells. In combination with donor lymphocyte transfusions, treatment with interferon-alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor has been studied in patients with recurrent CML and AML, and pre-emptively in patients with high-risk AML. Long-term remissions have been observed in cytokine-treated patients, indicating the beneficial effect of cytokine stimulation of GVL reactions. This is likely to be due to differentiation of leukaemia progenitor cells towards dendritic cells in vivo.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to define factor(s) influencing fetal erythropoiesis following bone marrow transplantation. Thirty-one transplanted patients (14 males, 17 females) were studied. The underlying diseases were chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML, 18 patients), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML, 7 patients) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, 6 patients). Reticulocyte and peripheral F cell estimation was carried out in donors and patients before transplantation and repeatedly during recovery. For F cell estimation, an indirect immunofluorescence assay was utilized. A significant increase above pre-BMT values in the percentage of F cells was observed in all patients from days 11 to 40 after transplantation. The increase of F cells on days 15, 18, 25, 32, 40 and 50 after transplantation was statistically significant in 14 patients who had shown an increase of F cells following chemotherapy (high responders) compared with the remaining 17 patients who did not respond so significantly. This finding supports the influence of the host bone marrow micro environment. The nature of the mechanisms operating remains to determined.\n",
      "Factors which may influence haematopoietic recovery after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were analysed. Forty-six evaluable patients transplanted with lymphocyte-depleted marrow for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and severe aplastic anaemia were studied. The median time for platelet recovery to greater than or equal to 20 and to greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9)/l was 21 (9-72) and 26 (11-86) days respectively. The neutrophil recovery to greater than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l and the leucocyte recovery to greater than or equal to 1.0 x 10(9)/l was 19 (8-47) and 18 (6-47) days respectively. No relation was found between the number of infused granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells, erythroid burst-forming cells, diagnosis, graft-versus-host disease, antibiotic administration and recovery. Addition of a continuous 6-day infusion of anthracyclines to the conditioning regimen delayed the median recovery of platelets, neutrophils and leucocytes by 7-9 days. Fever during aplasia also inhibited haematopoietic recovery. It is speculated that leakage of intracellular anthracyclines after bone marrow infusion or fever secondary to anthracyclines-induced oromucositis is responsible for the delayed bone marrow recovery.\n",
      "We investigated the influence of race as a risk factor for the outcome of HLA-identical marrow transplantation. The actuarial survival at 2 years after grafting of Blacks, Hispanics and Asians was compared with that of Caucasians transplanted between 1971 and 1985 for aplastic anaemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Among patients with aplastic anaemia, there was no difference with regard to engraftment or actuarial survival among different racial groups. Among patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, Blacks had a lower survival (P = 0.03) than other groups, although there was no obvious single factor accounting for this difference. In patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia, survival was comparable among the different races. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease appeared to occur with similar frequencies in all groups, except for a slightly higher incidence among Blacks with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. Larger numbers of patients need to be examined before firm conclusions can be drawn.\n",
      "Fourteen patients with poor-risk acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and five patients with accelerated phase/blast crisis chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) were treated with 3 days of oral idarubicin (25 mg/m2/day). No complete remissions or return to chronic phase CML were observed. A fall in the peripheral blast count was seen in all patients with the first cycle of treatment, and with subsequent cycles in CML patients, but all responses were transient, with eventual reemergence of peripheral blasts. In some patients, there was a clear cut improvement in symptoms such as bone and splenic pain. Five of the AML patients and all of the CML patients were treated as out-patients. In this group of patients oral idarubicin was found to be a useful drug for palliative treatment.\n",
      "CBA mouse strains have been used for many years as a model of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia and the leukaemias in CBA and their F1 hybrids are characterised by a specific loss of heterozygosity involving one homologue of chromosome 2. Previous cytogenetic studies of transplanted irradiated bone marrow, or of bone marrow obtained from irradiated mice significantly before the appearance of leukaemia, have been interpreted as the chromosome 2 deletion being a high frequency, possibly initiating event. However, these studies had not specifically addressed the question of whether the characteristic deletion was induced at a high frequency in stem cells. Using a PCR-based technique, we have studied the induction of chromosome 2 LOH in the progeny of (CBA/H x C57BL/6)F1 stem cells after a potentially leukaemogenic radiation exposure. Whilst chromosome 2 LOH can be induced directly by irradiation and there is a preferential loss of the CBA allele, the frequency is no greater than LOH induced in other chromosomal regions studied. The data do not support radiation-induced deletion involving one homologue of chromosome 2 in long-term repopulating stem cells (<1 in 200) being as high a frequency event as might be inferred by previous cytogenetic studies of total bone marrow.\n",
      "Longitudinal molecular measurable residual disease (MRD) sampling after completion of therapy serves as a refined tool for identification of imminent relapse of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) among patients in long-term haematological complete remission. Tracking of increasing quantitative polymerase chain reaction MRD before cytomorphological reappearance of blasts may instigate individual management decisions and has paved the way for development of pre-emptive treatment strategies to substantially delay or perhaps even revert leukaemic regrowth. Traditionally, MRD monitoring is performed using repeated bone marrow aspirations, albeit the current European LeukemiaNet MRD recommendations acknowledge the use of peripheral blood as an alternative source for MRD assessment. Persistent MRD positivity in the bone marrow despite continuous morphological remission is frequent in both core binding factor leukaemias and nucleophosmin 1-mutated AML. In contrast, monthly assessment of MRD in peripheral blood superiorly separates patients with imminent haematological relapse from long-term remitters and may allow pre-emptive therapy of AML relapse.\n",
      "Previous studies have suggested an important role of ERs (oestrogen receptors) in the pathogenesis of leukaemias. However, there is no information so far about the epigenetic characteristics of ERalpha isoforms and ERbeta in leukaemias. In the present study, the mRNA expression and promoter CpG methylation of ERalpha isoforms (i.e. ERalpha-A, -B and -C) and ERbeta in leukaemia cell lines were evaluated using RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) and MSP (methylation-specific PCR) respectively. The methylation of ERs was further analysed in acute leukaemia patients by MSP and direct DNA sequencing. Although all ERalpha isoforms and ERbeta were methylated in all leukaemia cell lines, except for ERalpha-C, which was unmethylated in HL-60 and K562 cell lines, only the expression of ERalpha-A was deficient in all cell lines and its expression could be reactivated by DNA demethylation reagents. With regard to the methylation characteristics in acute leukaemia patients, only ERalpha-A was inactivated and specifically methylated (95%; 38/40) in almost all patients and unmethylated in all healthy controls, whereas ERalpha-B, -C and ERbeta were methylated in both patients and healthy controls. This result suggested that the methylated status of ERalpha-A might serve as an epigenetic biomarker of leukaemias. The present study is the first report that demonstrates selective inactivation of ERalpha isoforms through the promoter CpG methylation pathway in leukaemias.\n",
      "AML is a common life-threatening blood system malignancy. The treatment of AML continues to face greater challenges. An abnormal haematopoietic niche with high adhesion and proliferation might be the root cause of resistance and relapse. Most leukaemia cells are stored in the endosteal niche and recess in the G0 phase, and they are not sensitive to varieties of radiotherapies and chemotherapies. G-CSF and AMD3100 are increasingly used in priming chemotherapy. G-CSF can promote leukaemia cells to the cell cycle, which improves the complete remission rate of leukaemia patients. AMD3100, the novel CXCR4 antagonist, could also potentially promote leukaemia cells to cell cycle and improve the susceptibility of leukaemia cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The combination of them enhances anti-leukaemia effect. So in this review, we explore the function of G-CSF and/or AMD3100 in the priming chemotherapy of haematological malignants.\n",
      "The demand for laboratory testing of blood lysozyme levels is increasing markedly. Although of limited value in the initial diagnosis of leukaemia, the importance of lysozyme levels in leukaemia management is rapidly being realised. An established manual method was examined in a successful attempt to develop an improved automated method using a centrifugal analyser. In comparison of serum and plasma the results showed no significant difference, indicating that the method described could use either material. The automated method was quicker, easier, more economical and more precise than the manual method it replaced.\n",
      "Chloroma, also called Granulocytic Sarcoma or Myeloid Sarcoma, is a rare malignant extra-medullary neoplasm of myeloid precursor cells. It is usually associated with myelo-proliferative disorders but its appearance may precede the onset of leukaemia. Chloroma may be found in several extracranial sites. Involvement of the head and neck region is uncommon. Differential diagnosis is often difficult and includes acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, large cell NHL, lymphoblastic lymphoma and Ewing sarcoma. The case is presented of a maxillo-ethmoidal chloroma occurring in a case of poor prognosis acute myeloid leukaemia, emphasizing the clinical and cyto-histological features and problems concerning differential diagnosis.\n",
      "Childhood acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) requires intensive therapy and is associated with survival rates that are substantially inferior to many other childhood malignancies. We undertook a retrospective analysis of Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry data from 1997 to 2008 together with a single-centre audit during the same period assessing burden on service delivery at a tertiary children hospital (Royal Children Hospital, Brisbane). Although survival improved from 54.3% (1997-2002) to 69.2% (2003-2008), childhood AML caused a disproportionate number of childhood cancer deaths, accounting for 5.5% of all childhood cancer diagnoses yet 7.9% of all childhood cancer mortality. Furthermore, treatment was associated with significant toxicity requiring intensive use of local health resources. Novel therapeutic strategies aimed at improving survival and reducing toxicity are urgently required.\n",
      "According to the 2008 WHO classification, the category of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) includes atypical chronic myeloid leukaemia (aCML), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), MDS/MPN-unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U), juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) and a \"provisional\" entity, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (RARS-T). The remarkable progress in our understanding of the somatic pathogenesis of MDS/MPN has made it clear that there is considerable overlap among these diseases at the molecular level, as well as layers of unexpected complexity. Deregulation of signalling plays an important role in many cases, and is clearly linked to more highly proliferative disease. Other mutations affect a range of other essential, interrelated cellular mechanisms, including epigenetic regulation, RNA splicing, transcription, and DNA damage response. The various combinations of mutations indicate a multi-step pathogenesis, which likely contributes to the marked clinical heterogeneity of these disorders. The delineation of complex clonal architectures may serve as the cornerstone for the identification of novel therapeutic targets and lead to better patient outcomes. This review summarizes some of the current knowledge of molecular pathogenetic lesions in the MDS/MPN subtypes that are seen in adults: atypical CML, CMML and MDS/MPN-U.\n",
      "Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder arising in the haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment. This disease is characterised by a reciprocal t(9;22) chromosomal translocation, resulting in the formation of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome containing the BCR-ABL1 gene. As such, diagnosis and monitoring of disease involves detection of BCR-ABL1. It is the BCR-ABL1 protein, in particular its constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity, that forges the pathogenesis of CML. This aberrant kinase signalling activates downstream targets that reprogram the cell to cause uncontrolled proliferation and results in myeloid hyperplasia and 'indolent' symptoms of chronic phase (CP) CML. Without successful intervention, the disease will progress into blast crisis (BC), resembling an acute leukaemia. This advanced disease stage takes on an aggressive phenotype and is almost always fatal. The cell biology of CML is also centred on BCR-ABL1. The presence of BCR-ABL1 can explain virtually all the cellular features of the leukaemia (enhanced cell growth, inhibition of apoptosis, altered cell adhesion, growth factor independence, impaired genomic surveillance and differentiation). This article provides an overview of the clinical and cell biology of CML, and highlights key findings and unanswered questions essential for understanding this disease.\n",
      "The classic Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), which include polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia and primary myelofibrosis, originate from a stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation that manifests itself with variable haematopoietic cell lineage involvement; they are characterized by a high degree of similarities and the chance to transform each to the other and to evolve into acute leukaemia. Their molecular pathogenesis has been associated with recurrent acquired mutations in janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL). These discoveries have simplified the diagnostic approach and provided a number of clues to understanding the phenotypic expression of MPNs; furthermore, they represented a framework for developing and/or testing in clinical trials small molecules acting as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. On the other hand, evidence of abnormal epigenetic gene regulation as a mechanism potentially contributing to the pathogenesis and the phenotypic diversity of MPNs is still scanty; however, study of epigenetics in MPNs represents an active field of research. The first clinical trials with epigenetic drugs have been completed recently, whereas others are still ongoing; results have been variable and at present do not allow any firm conclusion. Novel basic and translational information concerning epigenetic gene regulation in MPNs and the perspectives for therapy will be critically addressed in this review.\n",
      "After remission-induction chemotherapy in 31 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, patients immediately received CNS prophylaxis. Thirteen patients received triple intrathecal drug therapy, while 18 patients received intrathecal methotrexate and cranial irradiation; systematic chemotherapy was administered as well to both groups. Six patients developed CNS leukaemia during complete remission, 2 in the non-radiated patients and 4 in patients who had received cranial irradiation. Drug chemoprophylaxis may therefore substitute cranial radiotherapy when effective systemic regimens are used. Such CNS chemoprophylaxis will result in fewer, long-term CNS side-effects.\n",
      "A 20-year-old woman presented with a 4-month history of follicular papules distributed over the trunk and extremities. One month later, routine blood tests were abnormal, showing acute myeloblastic leukaemia (M1 in the French-American-British classification). Skin biopsy demonstrated a dermal infiltrate of a large number of neutrophils with occasional eosinophils and histiocytes in the vicinity of the hair follicle remnants. Intermingled in the infiltrate were atypical cells that were morphologically and immunohistochemically identical to leukaemic myeloblasts. Cultures of the papules and special stains of the biopsy specimen were negative for bacteria and fungi. The follicular eruption improved promptly in response to chemotherapy for the leukaemia. We suggest that this case may represent a rare, follicular variant of neutrophilic dermatosis associated with myelogenous leukaemia.\n",
      "The discovery of the first example of retroviral transduction of an immunological effector molecule has led us to reconsider the possible importance of cell surface receptors of the immune system in leukaemia development. Antigen receptors on lymphoid cells not only bind external ligands but are crucial in the control of cellular proliferation. The concept of autocrine stimulation in oncogenesis is already well established and we see no reason to exclude the possibility of analogous mechanism operating through antigen receptors. At present, we are investigating the oncogenic function of the retrovirus (FeLV-T17) carrying a T-cell receptor gene (v-tcr). In addressing the general concept of oncogenesis by ligand/receptor interactions in the immune system we face the problem of the diversity and, for T-cell antigen receptors, the complex nature of receptor-ligand interaction. Nevertheless, the implications of the model encourage us to continue to search for new experimental tools and approaches to the question.\n",
      "Resistance to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukaemia is a major obstacle to a successful outcome for many patients. Often, there is resistance against a broad range of drugs due to multiple, simultaneously active processes. These mechanisms include effects on drug influx and efflux, drug activation/inactivation, DNA repair mechanisms, altered response of end targets, an altered haematopoietic microenvironment and dysfunctional apoptotic pathways. This article reviews the factors that determine leukaemic cell chemosensitivity and discusses the potential for rationally guided therapy.\n",
      "Residual recipient haematopoietic cells may coexist with donor haemopoietic tissue following BMT. This is known as mixed chimaerism. The incidence of mixed chimaerism varies with the sensitivity of the detection system used; DNA based methodologies are the most sensitive. The influence of mixed chimaerism on leukaemia relapse and graft rejection is unclear. The lineages in which mixed chimaerism occurs may affect outcome.\n",
      "Five patients with clinical and laboratory features typical for juvenile chronic myeloid leukaemia (JCML) are presented. Rearrangement of the j joining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Jh) was demonstrated in three children out of five analysed. As no Vh to DhJh nor kappa light chain rearrangements were demonstrated, it is reasonable to speculate that the transforming event of the stem cell happened at the stage when Dh to Jh rearrangement took place. As the monocytic lineage is prominent in JCML, it is suggested that the transforming event happens in a unique stem cell with intermediate differentiation towards the myelomonocytic as well as the B-lymphatic lineage. This stem cell, which is present at a certain stage of embryogenesis, disappears later. Such an early 'hybrid' cell is sometimes involved in leukaemias of early infancy, and may be the transformed cell in some cases of infantile leukaemia.\n",
      "The expression of apoptosis-related genes BCL2, BAX, BCL2L1, BCL2A1, MCL1, DAPK1 and MYC was studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction on total RNA samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, n = 16), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 27), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML, n = 12), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, n = 19) and chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL, n = 32). BCL2, BAX, BCL2A1, MCL1, DAPK1 and MYC were overexpressed in all patient groups. BCL2L1 was underexpressed in CLL and CML, but not in AML, ALL and MCL. MCL1 levels were significantly higher in CD13 and CD33-positive ALL, and in CD56-positive AML samples. BCL2, BCL2L1, BCL2A1 and MCL1 were overexpressed and DAPK1 was underexpressed in CLL samples with a 11q23 deletion. MYC overexpression was significantly associated with shorter overall survival in MCL (P < 0.01). AML patients with a normal karyotype showed a higher frequency of BCL2A1 overexpression (P < 0.001) than those with an abnormal karyotype.\n",
      "Infant acute leukaemia is characterised by specific genetic rearrangements and a rapid onset of disease shortly after birth. The vast majority of these cases bear rearranged MLL alleles. However, many facets of MLL-rearranged leukaemia are largely unknown. Basically, there exists a fundamental and evolutionary conserved relationship between the family of MLL/Trithorax proteins and the regulation of HOX gene clusters. Therefore, direct MLL fusion proteins are per se able to deregulate HOX genes, except when reciprocal MLL fusion proteins come into play. This reviews discusses (i) the current situation in MLL-rearranged leukaemia, (ii) the molecular and genetic tools to functionally investigate the many different MLL fusions, (iii) the latency of disease development, (iv) a novel cancer mechanism that has been recently uncovered when different MLL fusion protein complexes were characterized, (v) mutated signalling pathways in MLL-rearranged leukaemia and (vi) presents new ideas on how a given MLL fusion protein may modulate existing signalling pathways in leukaemic cells. The hypothesis is posed that the many different fusion partners of MLL are critically distinct entities for which specific inhibitors should be identified in the future.\n",
      "Integration of bovine leukaemia virus DNA was investigated at all stages of infection in cattle. We report here the detection of integrated proviral DNA in the majority of antibody positive animals without lymphocytosis. In all but one case virus was integrated at a number of different sites. Hybridization analysis failed to detect proviral sequences in animals shown to be BLV antibody-negative by the Agar Gel Immunodiffusion assay. The pattern of integration in leukocytes from animals with persistent lymphocytosis was similar to that in sero-positive animals without lymphocytosis in that multiple sites of integration were evident. As reported by others only one or a few sites of integration were detected in tumours from enzootic bovine leukosis animals. Tumours from different sites in individual animals were either monoclonal or oligoclonal.\n",
      "The objective of the present study was to investigate the role of early common infections and perinatal characteristics in the aetiology of childhood common leukaemia. A case-control study was conducted from 1995 to 1998 in France, and included 473 incident cases of acute leukaemia (AL) (408 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 65 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) age-, sex- and region-matched with 567 population-based controls. Data on the medical history of the child and his/her environment were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Analyses were conducted using nonconditional logistic regression. A slight negative association with early infections was observed (OR=0.8; 95% CI (0.6-1.0)). The association was stronger for early gastrointestinal infections. Early day-care was found to be associated with a decreased risk of AL (OR=0.6; 95% CI (0.4-0.8) and OR=0.8; 95% CI (0.5-1.2) for day-care starting before age 3 months and between 3 and 6 months, respectively). No association with breast-feeding was observed, irrespective of its duration. A birth order of 4 or more was associated with a significantly increased risk of AL (OR=2.0; 95% CI (1.1-3.7) with ALL). A history of asthma was associated with a decreased risk of ALL (OR 0.5; 95% CI (0.3-0.90). Although the results regarding birth order and breast-feeding do not fit with Greaves' hypothesis, the study supports the hypothesis that early common infections may play a protective role in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia, although this effect was not more marked for common ALL.\n",
      "Positive associations between leukaemia and radon concentrations have been observed in England, Scotland and Wales, and Canada. Results of a similar study for the populations of 41 French administrative areas ('départements') are reported for 1984-1986. The average indoor radon and gamma ray concentrations per 'département' range from 12 to 147 Bq.m-3 and from 28 to 142 nG.h-1, respectively. Acute lymphoid leukaemia mortality rate is similar to the national level, whereas an excess of acute myeloid leukaemia deaths is observed. According to Poisson regression models and modified tests for partial correlation, acute myeloid leukaemia mortality is significantly and positively related to indoor radon concentration whether or not adjustment is made for indoor gamma ray dose, socioeconomic status and linear gradient. This result reinforces the evidence that indoor exposure to high levels of radon is a leukaemic environmental hazard.\n",
      "The Philadelphia chromosome, widely implicated in human leukaemia, is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(9;22) (q34;q11) in which the abl oncogene located at 9q34 is translocated to chromosome 22q11, where it is fused head-to-tail with 5' exons of the bcr gene. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, some patients have a breakpoint within the major breakpoint cluster region of the bcr gene, whereas others have the break within its first intron. This second type of translocation results in the transcription of a 7.0-kilobase chimaeric bcr/abl messenger RNA translated into a bcr/abl fusion protein, p190, which has an abnormal tyrosine kinase activity and is strongly autophosphorylated in vitro. We have generated mice transgenic for a bcr/abl p190 DNA construct and find that progeny are either moribund with, or die of acute leukaemia (myeloid or lymphoid) 10-58 days after birth. This finding is evidence for a causal relationship between the Philadelphia chromosome and human leukaemia.\n",
      "Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is secreted by the hypothalamus and acts on the pituitary gland to stimulate the release of growth hormone (GH). GHRH can also be produced by human cancers, in which it functions as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor. We have previously shown that synthetic antagonistic analogues of GHRH are able to successfully suppress the growth of 60 different human cancer cell lines representing over 20 cancers. Nevertheless, the expression of GHRH and its receptors in leukaemias has never been examined. Our study demonstrates the presence of GHRH receptor (GHRH-R) on 3 of 4 human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines-K-562, THP-1, and KG-1a-and significant inhibition of proliferation of these three cell lines in vitro following incubation with the GHRH antagonist MIA-602. We further show that this inhibition of proliferation is associated with the upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes and inhibition of Akt signalling in leukaemic cells. Treatment with MIA-602 of mice bearing xenografts of these human AML cell lines drastically reduced tumour growth. The expression of GHRH-R was further confirmed in 9 of 9 samples from patients with AML. These findings offer a new therapeutic approach to this malignancy and suggest a possible role of GHRH-R signalling in the pathology of AML.\n",
      "Deregulated Hedgehog (Hh) signalling activity may be associated with a broad range of cancer types and hence has become an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Although initial haematological interest focused on the therapeutic targeting of this pathway in chronic myeloid leukaemia), small molecule inhibitors targeting the Hh pathway are now being tested in a range of other myeloid disorders, including myelofibrosis, myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukaemia. In this review we will evaluate the rationale for targeting of the Hh pathway in myeloid diseases and discuss the novel agents that have entered the clinical arena. We will discuss pre-clinical models, emerging clinical trial data, and suggest how these targeted therapies may address current unmet medical needs. Finally, we will explore potential limitations of these therapies due to the emergence of secondary resistance mechanisms and speculate on future developments within this arena.\n",
      "Most sera from leukaemic cattle inhibited phagocytic activity of normal bovine peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes, growth of interleukin 2-dependent bovine T cells and mitogen-induced (phytohaemagglutinin, concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen, lipopolysaccharide and protein A) blastogenesis of normal bovine lymphocytes. By contrast, antibody-dependent, and spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity were suppressed by only a few sera. The antibody titer against bovine leukaemia virus in these sera correlated with the percent inhibition of lymphocyte blastogenesis. These leukotic sera had no direct cellular cytotoxicity and the inhibitory activity was not lost by dialysis or heat inactivation at 62 degrees C for 30 min. However, the activity was reduced by heating at 80 degrees C for 30 min. Neither the concanavalin A sepharose 4B effluent fraction nor 3.5% polyethyleneglycol-treated serum was found to contain significant lymphocyte-inhibitory activity. Blastogenic transformation of lymphocytes prepared from leukaemic cattle was hardly detectable; however, the mitogen responsiveness of these lymphocytes was improved by a 37 degrees C 1-h preincubation followed by washing.\n",
      "After decades when intensive chemotherapy remained the only effective anti-acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treatment, a torrent of novel, less toxic agents are about to revolutionise AML therapy. Prolonged remissions with good quality of life become achievable for many patients previously considered only for palliative care because they could not tolerate intensive therapy. As treatment options multiply, the importance of genetic profile is recognised, even for advanced-age patients for whom cure is unlikely. With lack of randomised comparative trials for most treatment regimens, one can only extrapolate data from existing studies to make evidence-based decisions. We herein present seven common clinical scenarios illustrating the complexity of treating older AML patients and describe our approach to their management. In each case, up-to-date data on relevant agents to be offered to a particular patient are discussed. The current review is limited to the drugs, available and approved in the Western world and many promising agents, still under investigation, are not discussed.\n",
      "We report a patient who developed Philadelphia chromosome negative acute myeloblastic leukaemia with trisomy 8 and trisomy 11 after receiving treatment with alkylating agents and interferon for chronic myelocytic leukaemia positive for Philadelphia chromosome. Leukaemic cells were positive for myeloperoxidase and expressed CD13, CD33 and DR; some expressed CD2, CD4 and CD34. The fluorescence in situ hybridization method revealed that bcr-abl fusion genes were absent from > 90% of the bone marrow cells. The major bcr rearrangement was not detected by Southern blot analysis. We conclude that the leukaemic cells negative for Philadelphia chromosome may have developed as a result of treatment with alkylating agents and interferon in the present case.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the commonest form of leukaemia in Europe and North America, and mainly, though not exclusively, affects older individuals. It has a very variable course, with survival ranging from months to decades. Major progress has been made in identification of molecular and cellular markers that could predict disease progression in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In particular, the mutational profile of immunoglobulin genes and some cytogenetic abnormalities are important predictors of prognosis. However, these advances have raised new questions about the biology, prognosis, and management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, some of which are addressed here. In particular, we discuss how better understanding of the function of the B-cell receptor, the nature of genetic lesions, and the balance between proliferation and apoptosis have affected our ability to assess prognosis and to manage chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Available treatments generally induce remission, although nearly all patients relapse, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia remains an incurable disease. Advances in molecular biology have enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and, together with development of new therapeutic agents, have made management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia more rational and more effective than previously. Unfortunately, we know of no way that chronic lymphocytic leukaemia can be prevented. Early detection is practised widely, but seemingly makes no difference to the patient eventual outcome.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To analyse the common causes of death in paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia cases at a tertiary care facility. METHODOLOGY: The retrospective study was conducted at the Paediatric Oncology Department of the Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and comprised newly-registered cases of acute myeloid leukaemia aged <18 years from January 1, 2012, onwards and who completed their treatment before January 31, 2019. Data was retrieved from medical records and was analysed using SPSS 23. RESULTS: Of the 206 cases, 130(63.1%) were males and 76(36.9%) were females. Overall mean age at diagnosis was 5.96±3.57 years (range: 9 months to 15 years). Of the total, 6(2.9%) patients died before the start of treatment. Of the remaining, 43(21.5%) patients died during 1st induction chemotherapy, and 16(8%) during the post-induction period, with overall treatment-related mortality being 65(31.5%). The main cause of death during the first two weeks of induction was infection, while infection followed by multi-organ failure was the main cause of mortality in the second phase. A total of 130(63%) patients completed the treatment. Overall survival was 81(62.3%) while disease-free survival was 77 (59.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall treatment-related mortality rate in paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia cases was found to be high. Pregnancies achieved by IVF/ICSI, being complicated with severe OHSS could be related to gestational hypertension.\n",
      "Mastocytosis is a rare disease with varied presentation, myriad symptomatology and variable prognosis. Most patients present with cutaneous disease and mediator-related symptomatology with a small subset having systemic disease (systemic mastocytosis, SM). A subset of the latter develops synchronous or metachronous haematologic neoplasms (SM-AHN), most commonly chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Advanced systemic mastocytosis (ASM) is seen in a relatively small number of patients and is usually associated with organ dysfunction, and may present with hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and ascites with progression to leukaemic transformation (mast cell leukaemia/acute myeloid leukaemia) occurring in a few patients. This paper discusses the clinical and pathologic features of the entire spectrum of SM in adults.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Genotyping has become more cost-effective and less invasive with the use of buccal cell sampling. However, low or fragmented DNA yields from buccal cells collected using FTA cards often requires additional whole genome amplification to produce sufficient DNA for genotyping. In our case-control study of childhood leukaemia, discordance was found between genotypes derived from blood and whole genome amplified FTA buccal DNA samples. We aimed to develop a user-friendly method to correct for this genotype misclassification, as existing methods were not suitable for use in our study. METHODS: Discordance between the results of blood and buccal-derived DNA was assessed in childhood leukaemia cases who had both blood and FTA buccal samples. A method based on applying misclassification probabilities to measured data and combining results using multiple imputations, was devised to correct for error in the genotypes of control subjects, for whom only buccal samples were available, to minimize bias in the odds ratios in the case-control analysis. RESULTS: Application of the correction method to synthetic datasets showed it was effective in producing correct odds ratios from data with known misclassification. Moreover, when applied to each of six bi-allelic loci, correction altered the odds ratios in the logically anticipated manner given the degree and direction of the misclassification revealed by the investigations in cases. The precision of the effect estimates decreased with decreasing size of the misclassification data set. CONCLUSIONS: Bias arising from differential genotype misclassification can be reduced by correcting results using this method whenever data on concordance of genotyping results with those from a different and probably better DNA source are available.\n",
      "Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) sequences make up ~8% of the human genome and increased expression of some HERV proteins has been observed in various pathologies including leukaemia and multiple sclerosis. However, little is known about the function of these HERV proteins or environmental factors which regulate their expression. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used very extensively as antimicrobials and antivirals in numerous consumer products although their effect on the expression of HERV gene products is unknown. Cell proliferation and cell toxicity assays were carried out on human acute T lymphoblastic leukaemia (MOLT-4) and Fanconi anaemia associated acute myeloid leukaemia (FA-AML1) cells treated with two different sizes of AgNPs (7nm and 50nm diameter). Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were then used to the assess expression of HERV-W syncytin-1 mRNA and protein in these cells. FA-AML1 cells were more sensitive overall than MOLT-4 to treatment with the smaller 7nm sized AgNp being the most toxic in these cells. MOLT-4 cell were more resistant and showed no evidence of differential toxicity to the different sized particles. Syncytin-1 mRNA and protein were induced by both 7 and 50nm AgNPs in both cell types yet with different kinetics. In summary, the observation that AgNPs induce expression of syncytin-1 in FA-AML1 and MOLT-4 cells at doses as little as 5 µg/ml is grounds for concern since this protein is up-regulated in both malignant and neurodegenerative diseases. Considering the widespread use of AgNPs in the environment it is clear that their ability to induce syncytin-1 should be investigated further in other cell types.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: For a child to develop acute leukaemia (AL), environmental exposure may not be sufficient: interaction with a susceptibility factor to the disease, such as Down syndrome (DS), may also be necessary. We assessed whether breastfeeding and early infection were associated with the risk of developing AL in children with DS. METHODS: Children with DS in Mexico City, and either with or without AL, were the cases (N=57) and controls (N=218), respectively. Population was divided in children with AL and with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and also in children < or = 6 and >6 years old. RESULTS: Breastfeeding and early infections showed moderate (but not significant) association for AL, whereas hospitalisation by infection during the first year of life increased the risk: odds ratios (confidence interval 95%) were 0.84 (0.43-1.61), 1.70 (0.82-3.52); and 3.57 (1.59-8.05), respectively. A similar result was obtained when only ALL was analysed. CONCLUSION: We found that breastfeeding was a protective factor for developing AL and ALL, and during the first year of life, infections requiring hospitalisation were related to a risk for developing the disease in those children with DS >6 years of age. These data do not support the Greaves hypothesis of early infection being protective for developing ALL.\n",
      "The paper presents results of a follow-up to an earlier study which established a geospatial link between naturally elevated uranium (U) levels in borehole water and haematological abnormalities in local residents serving as a proxy for leukaemia prevalent in the area. While the original study focussed on drinking water only, this paper also explores alternative exposure pathways including the inhalation of dust and the food chain. U-levels in grass and tissue of sheep generally reflect U-levels in nearby borehole water and exceed background concentrations by 20 to nearly 500 times. U-levels in sheep tissue increase with age of the animal. Wool showed the highest U-concentration followed by other non-consumable tissue such as hooves, teeth and bones. Lower levels occur in edible parts such as meat and inner organs. The U-deposition rate in wool is several orders of magnitudes higher than in bone as a known target organ. Wool is an easy-to-sample non-invasive bioindicator for U-levels in meat. Depending on the original water content, dried samples show up to 5 times higher U-levels than identical fresh material. Contaminated drinking water is the main exposure pathway for farm residents resulting in U-uptake rates exceeding the WHO tolerable daily intake (TDI) limit by up to 900%. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that U-speciation is dominated by a neutral calcium-uranyl-carbonate complex of relatively low toxicity. Commercially available household filters are able to significantly reduce U-levels in well water and are thus recommended as a short-term intervention. Based on average consumption rates sheep meat, as local staple food, accounts for 34% of the TDI for U. Indoor levels of radon should be monitored, too, since it is linked to both, U and leukaemia. With elevated U-levels being present in other geological formations across South Africa boreholes in these areas should be surveyed.\n",
      "377 untreated acute leukaemia patients were categorized according to FAB and cytochemical criterials and simultaneously phenotyped with the use of 6-21 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) of VI series (W. Knapp, Vienna). The leukaemia phenotype was compared with the patients outcome after treatment. In adult ANLL patients a positive relationships was proved statistically between the expression of the CD 15 cell differentiation antigen on leukaemic blasts and the CR rate (p less than 0.01, chi 2 test). Also a comparison of the Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that the CD 15 positive group of ANLL patients has a better outcome than the CD 15 negative one (p less than 0.01, by Wilcoxon and Log-rank tests). Thus, examination of cell differentiation antigens could be a useful addition to existing risk assignment in acute leukaemia.\n",
      "We previously reported that susceptibility to childhood B cell precursor ALL (BCP ALL) is associated with HLA-DPB1 alleles having glutamic acid (E) rather than lysine (K) in the P4 antigenic peptide-binding pocket. Clustering approximately 90% of DPB1 alleles into DPB69E (DP2, 6, 8) and DPB69K (DP1, 3, 4) supertypes revealed that DP2 and DP8 are associated with BCP ALL, but DP6 is also associated with non-BCP leukaemia. Here, we report that only one of seven alleles with the DP6 supertype (DPB1(*)0601) is associated with childhood leukaemia (leukaemia vs controls: odds ratio, 95% confidence interval [OR, CI]: 4.6, 2.0-10.4; corrected P=0.019), but not with childhood solid tumours or lymphomas. DPB1(*)0601 is also significantly associated with leukaemia subtypes, including BCP ALL, Pro-B ALL, T-ALL and AML. DPB1(*)0601 is significantly over-transmitted (76.9%) from parents to children with BCP ALL (OR; CI: 4.7; 1.01-22.2). Sequencing the coding region of DPB1(*)0601 revealed an exon 1-4 haplotype [T-DEAV-KIL-RVI] shared with DPB1(*)0301 and 0901, but no evidence of germline mutations in childhood leukaemia. These results suggest that the DPbeta0601 molecule may be functionally involved in childhood leukaemia. Analysis of peptide binding and T-cell activation by DPbeta0601-peptide complexes should help determine its role in childhood leukaemia causation.\n",
      "In the past, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) infection, and also latent FeLV infection, were commonly associated with lymphoma and leukaemia. In this study, the prevalence of FeLV provirus in tumour tissue and bone marrow in FeLV antigen-negative cats with these tumours was assessed. Seventy-seven diseased cats were surveyed (61 antigen-negative, 16 antigen-positive). Blood, bone marrow, and tumour samples were investigated by two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays detecting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences of the long terminal repeats (LTR) and the envelope (env) region of the FeLV genome. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed in bone marrow and tumour tissue. None of the antigen-negative cats with lymphoma was detectably infected with latent FeLV. The prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats with lymphoma was 20.8%. This suggests that causes other than FeLV play a role in tumorigenesis, and that latent FeLV infection is unlikely to be responsible for most feline lymphomas and leukaemias.\n",
      "A 57-year-old woman was admitted because of weakness, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, easy bruising and splenomegaly. A highly elevated leukocyte count with hairy-cell-like cells was found, the cells being positive for the monoclonal antibodies CD19, FMC7, CD11c and B-ly-7 and negative for CD24 and CD25. Blood and bone marrow were investigated not only in our own laboratory but also in several other laboratories resulting in a variety of possible diagnoses. Only after combining all data could a definitive diagnosis of variant hairy cell leukaemia be made. The patient was treated initially with a splenectomy and later on with interferon-alpha-2b, resulting in a steady decrease in the leukocyte count. After a follow-up of 2 years a nearly complete remission was obtained with a good quality of life. The differential diagnosis of this rare disorder is discussed with emphasis on the relative contribution of different diagnostic procedures.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Viruses (such as Epstein-Barr virus) and pathological conditions (mainly involving immunosuppression) have been shown to increase the risk of haematolymphopoietic malignancies. Other associations (diabetes, tonsillectomy, autoimmune diseases) have been inconsistently reported. METHODS: The association between different haematolymphopoietic malignancies (lymphomas, myelomas and leukaemias) and the previous medical history has been studied in a population-based case-control investigation conducted in Italy, based on face to face interviews to 2669 cases and 1718 population controls (refusal rates 10% and 19%, respectively). Controls were a random sample of the general population. RESULTS: Previous findings were confirmed concerning the association between non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and lupus erythematosus (odds ratio, OR=8.4; 95% CI 1. 6, 45), tuberculosis (OR=1.6; 1.05, 2.5) and hepatitis (1.8; 1.4, 2. 3). An association was found also between NHL and maternal (OR=2.8; 1.1, 6.9) or paternal tuberculosis (OR=1.7; 0.7, 3.9). Odds ratios of 4.0 (1.4, 11.8) and 4.4 (1.1, 6.6) were detected for the association between NHL and Hodgkin disease, respectively, and previous infectious mononucleosis, but recall bias cannot be ruled out. No association was found with diabetes, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. An association with malaria at young age and \"low grade\" lymphatic malignancies is suggested. One interesting finding was the observation of four cases of poliomyelitis among NHL patients, one among Hodgkin disease and one among myeloid leukaemia patients, compared with none among the controls (Fisher exact test for NHL and Hodgkin disease, p= 0.03, one tail). CONCLUSIONS: Some of these findings are confirmatory of previous evidence. Other observations, such as the putative role of the polio virus and of malaria are new. A unifying theory on the mechanisms by which previous medical history may increase the risk of haematolymphopoietic malignancies is still lacking.\n",
      "Monoclonal antibodies have become an important treatment modality in cancer therapy. Genetically engineered chimaeric and humanised antibodies have demonstrated activity against a variety of tumours. Whereas the humanised anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody HuM195 has only modest activity against overt acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), it can eliminate minimal residual disease detectable by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in acute promyelocytic leukaemia. High-dose radioimmunotherapy with beta-particle-emitting isotopes targeting CD33, CD45 and CD66 can potentially allow intensification of antileukaemic therapy before bone marrow transplantation. Conversely, alpha-particle immunotherapy with isotopes such as bismuth-213 or actinium-225 offers the possibility of selective tumour cell kill while sparing surrounding normal cells. Targeted chemotherapy with the anti-CD33-calicheamicin construct gemtuzumab ozogamicin has produced remissions as a single agent in patients with relapsed AML and appears promising when used in combination with standard chemotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed AML.\n",
      "Epidemiology has shown an association between exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) and childhood leukaemia. The causal nature and biological basis of this association are however questionable. Studies with aneuploid cell lines raised the hypothesis that ELF EMF may act as a coleukaemogen by compromising DNA damage response to genotoxic agents such as ionising radiation. We examined this hypothesis using gamma-ray-induced dicentric chromosome exchange in human lymphocytes. The results from 12 h post-gamma-ray exposure to fields of 0.23, 0.47 and 0.7 mT provide no support to the hypothesis. The power of the study was sufficient to exclude an ELF enhancement of chromosomal exchange of 10-15% (2SE).\n",
      "Much evidence has accumulated that childhood leukaemia (CL) is a rare response to a common, but unidentified, infection and in particular that situations involving the unusual mixing of urban and rural groups (approximating to, respectively, groups infected with, and susceptible to, the relevant microorganism) can produce localised epidemics with consequent increases of the infrequent leukaemic complication. During the Second World War, explosives production factories were built and operated at Drigg and Sellafield, and a shell filling factory at Bootle, in west Cumbria, England, requiring substantial numbers of construction workers to be brought into this remote and isolated area. Following the design of an earlier study of CL near large (post-war) rural construction sites, mortality from this disease was investigated with the help of the Office of National Statistics, in the area around these Cumbrian factories where local workers largely lived, during the construction period and with particular reference to the overlapping construction and operational phase when the mixing of local and migrant workers would have been greatest. An excess of leukaemia deaths at ages 1-14 was found during the construction period (observed 3; observed/expected (O/E) 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6, 6.0), which was more marked and statistically significant during the overlap with operations (O 3; O/E 4.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 12.2), especially at ages 1-4 (O 2; O/E 7.1, CI: 1.2, 23.6). A previous investigation did not detect this excess because it considered only a small part of west Cumbria that omitted the communities where most of the workforce lived, having incorrectly attributed the post-war expansion of the village of Seascale (situated between Drigg and Sellafield) to the wartime ordnance factories. The present findings are consistent with the results of the earlier study of rural construction projects and with the general evidence that marked rural-urban population mixing increases the risk of CL.\n",
      "The identification of HRX and its partner genes is offering new insights into the genetic basis of the 11q23 leukaemias. Although some patterns and associations between the partner genes are beginning to emerge, it is not yet possible to frame a single unifying hypothesis for 11q23 leukaemic transformation. The study of transcriptional controls in other species, especially Drosophila and yeast, is offering possible clues as to the function of HRX and some of its partners. The identification of more partner genes may help to resolve these questions. The recognized poor prognosis of 11q23 leukaemias has prompted important variations in clinical trials. The molecular analysis of 11q23 events has therefore been particularly important in generating new molecular tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease in these patients. Ultimately, an understanding of 11q23 leukaemogenesis may open up new avenues for the molecular therapy of this disease.\n",
      "The interplay between immune recovery, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-reactivation, CMV-driven immunity and graft-versus-leukaemia effect (GVL) was analysed in 108 children (median age: 8 years) who underwent haematopoietic-stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute leukaemia. Follow-up was 2 years unless death or relapse occurred. CMV-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was programmed weekly until month +3 post-HSCT. Immunomonitoring consisted of sequential lymphocyte subset enumerations and analyses of T-cell proliferative and γ-interferon responses to CMV and to adenovirus. In the 108 recipients, the 2-year relapse rate (RR) was 25% (median time to onset 4·5 months; range: 24 d-17 months). CMV reactivation occurrence was 31% (median time to onset 26 d). Donor/recipient CMV serostatus did not influence RR. Among the 89 recipients disease-free after day +120, i) early CMV-reactivation before day +30 was more frequent (P = 0·01) in the relapse recipient group opposed to the non-relapse group. ii) CD8(+) /CD28(-) and CD4(+) CD45RA(-) T-cell expansions induced by CMV did not influence RR, iii) Recovery of anti-CMV and also anti-adenovirus immunity and of naïve CD4(+) T-cells was faster in the non-relapse group (P = 0·008; 0·009 and 0·002 respectively). In contrast to adult acute myeloid leukaemia, CMV reactivation was associated with increased RR in this paediatric series. Accelerated overall immune recovery rather than CMV-driven immunity had a favourable impact on RR.\n",
      "Bcl-2 over-expression has been shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, whereas a predominance of Bax alpha to Bcl-2 accelerates apoptosis upon apoptotic stimuli. We sought to study the relevance of these apoptotic regulating gene products in leukaemia. In a panel of leukaemia and lymphoma cell lines (HL60, DoHH2, CEM C7, L1210 and S49), the Bax alpha-to-Bcl-2 ratio as assessed by Western-blot analysis correlated with sensitivity to dexamethasone treatment. In addition, in HAbax alpha-transfected CEM C7 clones, a similar correlation was found for dexamethasone and thapsigargin sensitivity. In bone-marrow aspirates from patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic or myelocytic leukaemia (ALL, n = 48; AML, n = 8), the Bcl-2 and Bax alpha levels were highly variable, but well within the range found in the Bax alpha transfectants and in the established cell lines. Bcl-2 levels were lower in T- than in B-lineage ALL, which could be ascribed to simultaneous inverse relation between Bcl-2 and WBC. By contrast, Bax alpha:Bcl-2 was independent of any presenting feature and was largely dependent on Bax alpha levels. Results suggest that Bax alpha:Bcl-2, rather than Bcl-2 alone is important for the survival of drug-induced apoptosis in leukemic cell lines and ALL.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive haematological malignancy with a poor overall survival. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to be elevated in a wide range of cancers including AML. Whilst previously thought to be mere by-products of cellular metabolism, it is now clear that ROS modulate the function of signalling proteins through oxidation of critical cysteine residues. In this way, ROS have been shown to regulate normal haematopoiesis as well as promote leukaemogenesis in AML. In addition, ROS promote genomic instability by damaging DNA, which promotes chemotherapy resistance. The source of ROS in AML appears to be derived from members of the \"NOX family\" of NADPH oxidases. Most studies link NOX-derived ROS to activating mutations in the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Ras). Targeting ROS through either ROS induction or ROS inhibition provides a novel therapeutic target in AML. In this review, we summarise the role of ROS in normal haematopoiesis and in AML. We also explore the current treatments that modulate ROS levels in AML and discuss emerging drug targets based on pre-clinical work.\n",
      "The identification of a local excess of cancer cases, possibly associated with ionizing radiation, always receives substantial media coverage and communication about clusters is difficult. We reviewed studies that examined the risk of leukaemia among young people near nuclear installations. An excess of leukaemia exists near some nuclear installations, at least for the reprocessing plants at Sellafield and Dounreay and the nuclear power plant Krümmel. Nonetheless, the results of multi-site studies invalidate the hypothesis of an increased risk of leukaemia related to nuclear discharge. Up until now, analytic studies have not found an explanation for the leukaemia clusters observed near certain nuclear installations. The hypothesis of an infectious aetiology associated with population mixing has been proposed, but needs to be investigated further. The review illustrates two recent examples in France (La Hague reprocessing plant) and in Germany (Krümmel power plant), where controversies developed after reports of increased leukaemia risks. These examples show the importance of recalling the current epidemiological knowledge and of using systematic recording of cases to replace the alleged excesses in a more general framework. Some elements should also be suggested from the recent French and German experiences to reinforce credibility in the results.\n",
      "The observation made over 30 years ago that the Philadelphia chromosome is present in nearly all patients with CML led to the identification of a novel fusion gene bcr-abl. In the past few years, the biochemical and biological properties of bcr-abl have been extensively explored. Bcr sequences appear to activate c-abl for transformation by binding to the SH2 domain of c-abl in an intramolecular interaction, presumably interfering with the adjacent SH3 regulatory domain. Upon introduction into bone marrow cells, bcr-abl can cause acute or chronic leukaemias in mice and can stimulate the growth of many cell types, including multipotent stem cells, in vitro. Although their growth is stimulated, these cells are not fully malignant blastic leukaemias. The molecular events that occur during the progression to blast crisis of CML remain largely undefined, but existing animal models and in vitro culture systems will be useful for identifying or testing candidate genes. The study of tyrosine kinase oncogenes in general will probably lead to the identification of relevant bcr-abl substrates. The elucidation of these molecules as well as more downstream events in the bcr-abl signalling pathway offers the hope for novel therapeutic interventions to control Philadelphia chromosome leukaemias.\n",
      "Acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) is a clonal process involving the myeloid subgroup of white blood cells. Chloromas, or myeloid sarcomas, are masses of myeloid leukaemic cells and are a unique aspect of AML. This case involves a 14-year-old boy with AML who presented with multiple chloromas at diagnosis. The patient extra-calvarial masses and bone marrow involvement responded to chemotherapy; however, his sacral epidural chloromas persisted despite four courses of chemotherapy. The central nervous system, bone marrow and testes have been known to be sanctuary sites for AML. This case illustrates that the sacral spinal canal may potentially be a sanctuary site for the disease process also.\n",
      "Fifty-three patients with Ph positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic phase were studied. Additional abnormalities were found in 29 (55%) patients and were more common in myeloid (64%) than lymphoid (45%) blast crisis. The most frequent were +Ph (32%), +8 (28%), +19 (19%), +20 (9%) and +21 (9%). i(17q) (9%) was associated with thrombocytopenia (5/5) and basophilia (2/5). The incidence of additional abnormalities was higher in patients treated with busulphan (70%) than hydroxyurea (44%). No significant differences were noted in the mean values of the clinical and haematological findings recorded at blast crisis between patients with only Ph positive (PP) cells and those with additional abnormalities (AP + AA). Univariate analysis identified karyotypic findings as an independent prognostic marker indicating its significance in assessing the response to therapy and survival after the onset of transformation.\n",
      "Multiparameter flow cytometry can allow for accurate lineage assignment of leukaemia cell populations in approximately 99% of cases, whereby the emphasis lies in the word 'can'. Despite the fact that the very few markers that are lineage-specific are localized inside the cell (e.g. myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin, cytoplasmic CD3, cytoplasmic CD22), several investigators still shy away from including these essential test elements in their routine panels. Of course, the staining of intracellular antigens requires the added effort of determining optimal conditions. Published suggestions often need to be revised, and cell lines must be used as positive and negative controls. The same holds true for other new and exciting applications of flow cytometry, such as the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) or the establishment of physiological assays (e.g. measuring the activity of drug-efflux pumps). The beauty of-and unfortunately for some, the problem with-multiparameter flow cytometry is that although immunophenotyping by flow cytometry has become a routine approach to the diagnosis of haematological malignancies it is a discipline that is still in development. New antibodies are continually being introduced and new diagnostic and prognostically relevant subtypes are being published in almost every issue of the major scientific journals. It is therefore very important for the flow cytometrist not only to strive for optimal performance of all tests employed but also to keep up with new knowledge and to incorporate it into the interpretation of routine specimens. We owe it to our patients to diagnose their disease accurately and in accordance with accepted standards of interpretation so that the treating physicians can trust immunophenotyping results and act accordingly in the management of their patients.\n",
      "A population consisting of 70 breeder cats, 43 clinical cases, and 16 feral cats was examined for the presence of Toxoplasma gondii, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). No oocysts of T. gondii were observed in 96 faecal samples; faecal samples were not available from the feral cats. Other intestinal parasites identified included Isospora felis (three cats), Isospora rivolta (five), Dipylidium canium (two), Toxocara cati (four), Toxascaris leonina (one), and Ancylostoma sp. (two). Using a kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on 117 sera including all the feral cats, nine had antibody to T. gondii antigen, three for antigens to FIV, and seven to the p27 antigen of FeLV. Of the nine cats with antibody to T. gondii, only one was also infected with FIV.\n",
      "Eighty-five adult patients under the age of 50 years with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were entered into a prospective controlled study conducted to compare the effectiveness of allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation and intensive chemotherapy for patients in first complete remission. Sixty-one patients (72%) achieved complete remission then received a consolidation treatment. After consolidation, 58 patients who were still in remission were assigned to three different therapeutic modalities. Fifty-two patients were evaluable: 20 patients who had an HLA-identical sibling donor underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation within 3 months after achievement of complete remission; the other 32 patients were randomized to receive autologous bone marrow transplantation or intensive sequential chemotherapy. The actuarial risk of relapse at 3 years was 18% for the allogeneic patients, 50% for the autologous patients and 83% in the chemotherapy group. The difference was highly significant (P less than 0.0002). The disease-free survival was respectively 66% (95% confidence interval 41-85%), 41% (95% confidence interval 16-66%) and 16% (95% confidence interval 0-31%) (P less than 0.004). We conclude that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is presently the best therapeutic approach for patients with AML in first complete remission.\n",
      "We analyzed the biological activity of HA14-1, a small organic compound inhibitor of Bcl-2, against established leukaemia cell lines and blasts from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. HA14-1 had a potent killing activity against the leukaemia cell line that expressed endogenous or ectopic Bcl-2. This activity was mostly caspase-independent and was not altered by the expression of a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Moreover, HA14-1 efficiently induced cell death in a broad spectrum of AML blasts but not in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Thus, single-agent regimens using Bcl-2 inhibitors such as HA14-1 may be advantageous in overcoming some forms of chemoresistance in AML.\n",
      "Expression of erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPO-R) was analysed in leukaemia cells from 150 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). EPO-R was expressed in 81 (60%) out of 136 AML, and in vitro treatment with EPO led to proliferation of leukaemia cells in 13 (16%) out of 81 AML examined. EPO-R expression and in vitro response to EPO were observed in all subtypes of AML according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification. All eight patients with FAB-M6 expressed EPO-R, and one out of four showed an in vitro response to EPO. Although there was no significant correlation (r = 0.2522) between the amount of EPO-R and the in vitro response to EPO, all of the AML patients who showed in vitro response expressed EPO-R. Stem cell factor significantly enhanced both EPO-R expression and in vitro response to EPO. Interleukin-3 tended to increase in vitro response to EPO. CD phenotypes, the amount of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptors and the amount of TPO receptors had no significant relationship with the amount of EPO-R. Patients with both EPO-R expression and in vitro response to EPO had shorter duration of complete remission than those without EPO-R (P = 0.0053). EPO-R was expressed in four (29%) out of 14 ALL, and none out of five ALL showed in vitro response to EPO.\n",
      "In children, acute leukaemia can mimic several orthopaedic pathologies and this variable presentation creates difficulties in achieving the correct diagnosis. Four consecutive cases are reported, all of which initially presented via the orthopaedic department, representing 17% of all new cases of leukaemia presenting to our hospital. This series is presented to highlight the need to place acute leukaemia on the list of differential diagnoses of acute joint pathology in children: the associated literature is reviewed.\n",
      "A leukaemic phase is uncommon in large cell lymphoma, particularly at presentation of the disease, and very few cases have been reported since immunological markers became available. We have studied 24 cases presenting over a period of 15 years. 16 were B-lineage and eight T-lineage. In five patients the large cell lymphoma represented a transformation of a preceding low grade, small cell lymphoproliferative disease. Three other patients with T-lineage large cell lymphoma presented with skin infiltration (two cases) or lymphoma-associated nephrotic syndrome (one case) 3-9 months before leukaemia occurred. The other 16 patients (12 B-lineage and four T-lineage) presented with de novo large cell leukaemia/lymphoma. With the exception of skin infiltration, clinical features did not differ between T and B-lineage cases. Prognosis was generally poor although a minority of patients lived 1-2 years. Median survival was 7 months. In the B-cell lymphomas immunological markers were those expected but among the T-cell cases there were many unusual immunophenotypes with frequent failure to express markers which are usually positive in peripheral T cells. Without the availability of immunological markers diagnosis would have been difficult, with acute myeloid leukaemia being the most important differential diagnosis. T-lineage and B-lineage cases could not be distinguished on cytological features. In the majority of cases the cells were very pleomorphic with nuclear lobulation, prominent nucleoli and marked cytoplasmic basophilia being commonly observed. Marked nuclear lobulation was not confined to T-lineage cases but was seen also in seven of 12 cases of de novo B-lineage leukaemia/lymphoma; it was readily apparent in histological sections and on ultrastructural examination.\n",
      "Primary plasma cell leukaemia (P-PCL) is a variant of multiple myeloma (MM) first diagnosed in the leukemic phase, with >2000/mm(3) circulating plasma cells (PCs) and plasmacytosis >20% of the white cell count. We investigated the clinical characteristics, therapy, immunophenotype and prognosis factors of 18 patients. Common features at diagnosis were asthenia (seven patients), renal insufficiency (ten patients), bone pain (seven patients), splenomegaly or hepatomegaly (five patients). Hypercalcemia was present at diagnosis in seven patients and was the most potent poor prognosis factor (P<0.05). Most patients (16 out of 18) were treated with an anthracyclin containing regiment; complete remission was attained in one patient and partial remission in 11 patients while six patients had no response. The median survival time from diagnosis was 7 months (2--12, 95% confidence interval), but response to treatment had favorable predictive value (P<0.05). The PCs were usually positive for mature B-cell markers (PCA-1, CD38). They expressed integrins which may increase their binding to endothelial cells and thus participate in PCL physiopathology by favoring plasmocyte extramedullary spread.\n",
      "Investigating 208 patients with acute haematological malignancies, we found that stem cell factor receptor (SCFR) was expressed on high numbers of blast cells from the vast majority of patients (93%) with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in transformation. SCFR was also detected in 62% of AMLs, in which it was directly associated to the expression of CD7, interleukin 6 receptor and CD34, and inversely to that of CD11b and CD14. SCFR-positive cases were preferentially represented in AML-M1 (70%) and in AML-M2 (83%) subsets, whereas only 45% of the remaining samples (M3-M4-M5) exhibited SCFR positively. Interestingly, 50% of cases with acute promyelocytic leukaemia expressed SCFR and this molecule was heterogenously regulated by in vitro treatment with all-trans retinoic acid.\n",
      "The findings of morphologically dysplastic features in haemopoietic cells in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has been named AML with trilineage myelodysplasia (AML/TMDS). We analysed the clinical data, karyotypes, and treatment outcomes of 230 de novo AML patients treated with the Japan Adult Leukaemia Study Group AML-87 protocol. 40 (17%) patients had AML/TMDS. Platelet count was significantly higher (P = 0.006) and bone marrow blasts were fewer (P = 0.01) in the AML/TMDS group than in the AML without TMDS. Abnormal karyotype was shown in 12/30 patients (40%) analysed. The complete remission (CR) rate for AML/TMDS was significantly lower than AML without TMDS (63% v 81%) (P = 0.01). The overall survival curves showed that the 40 patients with TMDS had a significantly worse survival than the 190 without TMDS (P = 0.0005). AML/TMDS also showed significantly worse disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the absence of TMDS in AML was the most significant factor in obtaining CR (P = 0.01) and a significant factor in predicting longer DFS (P = 0.04). Our data suggest that AML/TMDS responds poorly to intensive chemotherapy. Further study is required to determine the best treatment strategy for AML/TMDS and the biological differences between AML/TMDS and other types of AML.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Patient involvement in healthcare has expanded from the clinical practice setting to include collaboration during the research process. There has been a growing international interest in patient and public involvement in setting research priorities to reduce the risk of discrepancy between what patients with cancer and their relatives experience as important unanswered questions and those which are actually researched. This study aims to challenge the conventional research process by inviting patients with life-threatening cancer (primary malignant brain tumours or acute leukaemia), relatives and patient organisations to join forces with clinical specialists and researchers to identify, discuss and prioritise supportive care and rehabilitation issues in future research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an exploratory qualitative study comprising two sets of three focus group interviews (FGIs): one set for primary malignant brain tumours and the other for acute leukaemia. Separate FGIs will be carried out with patients and relatives including representation from patient organisations and clinical specialists to identify important unanswered questions and research topics within each group. The FGIs will be video/audio recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. This study will contribute to a patient-centred research agenda that captures issues that patients, their relatives, clinical specialists and researchers consider important. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is registered at the Danish Data Protection Agency (number: 2012-58-0004) and the Scientific Ethics Review Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark (number: H-15001485). Papers will be published describing the methods applied and the supportive care and rehabilitation issues that are identified as important for future research. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN57131943; Pre-results.\n",
      "Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are CD3(+)CD56(+) non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted immune effector cells. The present report demonstrates that it was possible to expand CIK cells obtained at diagnosis from patients with acute leukaemia. The percentage of CD3(+)CD56(+) CIK cells generated following culture ranged between 7.6% and 65% (median of 35.3%) and these cells were able to kill the human natural killer target K562 cells. Although the same effector cells were able to lyse autologous acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) target cells, they were not able to lyse autologous acute lymphoblastic leukaemia target cells. Pre-absorption of the CIK effector cells by K562 cells did not completely abrogate the cytotoxicity of CIK cells against autologous blasts in 9 out of 12 samples tested. Moreover, it was observed that the cytotoxicity generated by the CIK effector cells against allogeneic leukaemic blasts was similar to that against autologous blasts. The present study suggests the potential application of CIK cells in the immunotherapy of AML, either in minimal disease state, as donor lymphocyte infusion in relapse post allogeneic transplant, or in cases of chemotherapy refractory leukaemia.\n",
      "Cytogenetic abnormalities are among the most important factors affecting the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but approximately 40-50% of AML cases display a normal karyotype at diagnosis. Multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins overexpression is associated with worse prognosis in acute leukaemias, but its role in normal karyotype AML is less defined. We analysed the expression of P-glycoprotein (PGP), MDR-related protein (MRP) and lung resistance protein (LRP) in 135 adult patients with normal karyotype AML and its correlation with other biological features of the disease, to evaluate the impact of MDR proteins on response to therapy and on survival. Increased PGP expression was associated with lower rate of complete remission (CR; p = 0.006), similarly to advanced age. Cases overexpressing PGP displayed also a shorter event-free survival (EFS; 4 vs. 10 months, p = 0.035) and the increased expression of at least one MDR protein was associated with a reduced overall survival (OS; p = 0.038). Also age was predictive of worse prognosis. Our data confirm the prognostic role of MDR proteins, in particular of PGP, also in AML patients with normal karyotype at diagnosis. This finding could be used to stratify patients with different prognosis and to design risk-adapted therapeutic strategies.\n",
      "Granulocytic sarcoma is a neoplasm arising from myeloid precursor cells and frequently accompanies leukaemia and myeloproliferative disorders. Granulocytic sarcoma can arise anywhere, and it frequently involves bones, perineural tissues and lymph nodes. However, granulocytic sarcoma in the female genital organs is uncommon, and it is extremely rare that it presents as an adnexal or parametrial mass. We report here the CT and MR findings in a case of granulocytic sarcoma that manifested as a uterine cervical and parametrial mass mimicking a haemorrhagic abscess in a 50-year-old woman with chronic myelogenous leukaemia.\n",
      "As front line therapy has improved, the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia has become more difficult as the disease becomes resistant and the patient accumulates comorbidities. The outcome for those who relapse after immunochemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab is strongly influenced by the duration of initial response. Patients who relapse within the first year or with a TP53 abnormality have very high-risk disease and will not respond to chemotherapy. High dose glucocorticoid and alemtuzumab followed by an allogeneic stem cell transplant is probably the best approach for younger, fitter patients in this category. Those who relapse after 2-3 years without TP53 abnormality will probably respond to their initial therapy again. Relapse within 12-24 months carries an intermediate outlook. Additional options include bendamustine and rituximab, ofatumumab and lenalidomide. New therapies are on the horizon and patients should be discussed with a specialist centre and entered into a clinical trial whenever possible.\n",
      "Radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) in mice are characterised by deletions and point mutations in the Sfpi1/PU.1 transcription factor. Six AML cell lines were used to examine the impact of three previously described R235 point mutations. AML cells carry myeloid and stem cell markers and the R235 mutations differentially affect mRNA and protein abundance. Expression of Sfpi1/PU.1 target genes was deregulated in a broadly similar fashion irrespective of R235 mutation including Flt3, which is frequently subject to activating mutations in human myeloid leukaemias. While R235 mutations differentially affect protein abundance they resulted in similar disruption of Sfpi1/PU.1 functions.\n",
      "Following the discovery of BRD4 as a non-oncogene addiction target in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are being explored as a promising therapeutic avenue in numerous cancers. While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced haematological malignancies, mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, here we perform a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive MLL-AF9;Nras(G12D)-driven AML mouse model, and investigate dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistant mouse and human leukaemias. Our screen shows that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodelling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC repression in human leukaemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant leukaemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signalling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing of enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodelled regulatory landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signalling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Leukaemia is the most common cancer of childhood, accounting for a third of cases. In order to assist clinicians in its early detection, we systematically reviewed all existing data on its clinical presentation and estimated the frequency of signs and symptoms presenting at or prior to diagnosis. DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for all studies describing presenting features of leukaemia in children (0-18 years) without date or language restriction, and, when appropriate, meta-analysed data from the included studies. RESULTS: We screened 12 303 abstracts for eligibility and included 33 studies (n=3084) in the analysis. All were cohort studies without control groups. 95 presenting signs and symptoms were identified and ranked according to frequency. Five features were present in >50% of children: hepatomegaly (64%), splenomegaly (61%), pallor (54%), fever (53%) and bruising (52%). An additional eight features were present in a third to a half of children: recurrent infections (49%), fatigue (46%), limb pain (43%), hepatosplenomegaly (42%), bruising/petechiae (42%), lymphadenopathy (41%), bleeding tendency (38%) and rash (35%). 6% of children were asymptomatic on diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Over 50% of children with leukaemia have palpable livers, palpable spleens, pallor, fever or bruising on diagnosis. Abdominal symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain and abdominal distension are common. Musculoskeletal symptoms such as limp and joint pain also feature prominently. Children with unexplained illness require a thorough history and focused clinical examination, which should include abdominal palpation, palpation for lymphadenopathy and careful scrutiny of the skin. Occurrence of multiple symptoms and signs should alert clinicians to possible leukaemia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the reproducibility of wire codes to characterise residential power line configurations and to determine the extent to which wire codes provide a proxy measure of residential magnetic field strength in a case-control study of childhood leukaemia conducted in nine states within the United States. METHODS: Misclassification of wire codes was assessed with independent measurements by two technicians for 187 residences. The association between categories of wire code and measured level of magnetic field was evaluated in 858 residences with both a wire code measurement and a 24 hour measurement of the magnetic field in the bedroom. The strength of the association between category of wire code and risk of leukaemia was examined in two regions with different average levels of magnetic field in homes with high categories of wire code. RESULTS: The reproducibility of any of three different classifications of wire codes was excellent (kappa > or = 0.89). Mean and median magnetic fields, and the percentage of homes with high magnetic fields increased with increasing category for each of the wire code classification schemes. The size of the odds ratios for risk of leukaemia and high categories of wire code did not reflect the mean levels of the magnetic field in those categories in two study regions. CONCLUSION: Misclassification of categories of wire code is not a major source of bias in the study. Wire codes provide a proxy measure of exposure to residential magnetic fields. If magnetic fields were a risk factor for leukaemia, however, there would be some attenuation of risk estimates based on wire codes because of misclassification of exposure to magnetic fields at both extremes of the wire code range. The lack of an association between high categories of wire code and risk of leukaemia cannot be explained by a failure of the wire code classification schemes to estimate exposure to magnetic fields in the study area.\n",
      "A 5-year-old male cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) with a clinical history of bleeding tendency, severe anaemia, thrombocytopenia and elevated serum concentration of liver-related enzymes was examined post mortem. Ecchymotic haemorrhages were present on the left eyelid and forehead. The liver, kidney and spleen were markedly enlarged and the kidneys had capsular petechiae. Microscopically, numerous atypical cells resembling myeloid cells were observed in the bone marrow, and myelofibrosis was present. Atypical cells were also present in the blood vessels of the liver, kidney, spleen, lymph nodes, lung, heart, bladder, adrenal gland and brain. Some neoplastic cells had oval or pleomorphic macronuclei and others were multinucleated. Immunohistochemically, the majority of the neoplastic cells had granular cytoplasmic expression of the megakaryocyte-associated antigens Von Willebrand Factor and CD61-IIIa, but were negative for myeloperoxidase. A diagnosis of acute megakaryocytic leukaemia (AMKL)-like disease was made. This would appear to be the first report of AMKL-like disease in non-human primates. This monkey was infected with simian retrovirus type D and it is possible that this viral infection was associated with the development of neoplasia.\n",
      "Nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations in exon 12 represent the most frequent molecular aberrations in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Molecular detection of NPM1 mutation A could be a useful marker for routine monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). We established a calibrator-normalized relative quantification real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for NPM1 mutation A. ABL1 was used as a reference housekeeping gene and the NPM1 mutation A-containing OCI/AML3 cell line as a calibrator. Relative quantification was performed by calculating the NPM1 mutation A/ABL1 ratio which was normalized to the NPM1 mutation A/ABL1 ratio of OCI/AML3 calibrator cDNA. The assay showed a sensitivity of 10(-5). The clinical usefulness was evaluated by monitoring MRD in 51 AML patients with NPM1 mutation A. In 27 patients analysed at diagnosis and after induction treatment, NPM1 mutation A ratios showed a median log(10) reduction of 2.48, which correlated with response to therapy. Among the 51 patients, 21 relapsed and two lost the mutation. We established a sensitive, specific and reproducible assay for routine quantification and monitoring of NPM1 mutation A levels. However, clonal evolution was observed in 9.5% limiting the usefulness of the NPM1 mutation A mutation as a molecular marker in these patients.\n",
      "A retrospective analysis of the clinical and haematological characteristics of patients diagnosed as having juvenile chronic granulocytic leukaemia between 1971 and 1986 was carried out. Thirty-three children were identified who were between the ages of 18 weeks and 8.8 years at diagnosis. The disease was more frequent in boys than girls (23:10). The most common presenting symptoms were skin rash (58%) and bleeding manifestations (45%). All patients had some degree of splenomegaly and in 88% this was more than 3 centimetres below the costal margin. Hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy were also frequent findings. Anaemia was common and leucocytosis an invariable finding with a white cell count above 50 x 10(9) 1-1 in 42%. Monocytosis was found in 78%. Haemoglobin F measurements were available in 31 children and above 10% in 22 (67%). No child had the Philadelphia chromosome or monosomy 7. Thirty children were treated with chemotherapy, with a variable degree of symptomatic improvement. Twenty-nine patients had died with a median survival time of 5 months. The commonest cause of death was complications of bone marrow failure and no child developed acute leukaemia. Presenting characteristics associated with a longer survival period were age less than 6 months (P = 0.02), female sex (P = 0.02), HbF less than 10% (P = 0.0004) and the absence of bleeding manifestations (P = 0.03). We conclude that the prognosis for children aged over 6 months, with a raised HbF level is very poor, and that, in the absence of possible bone marrow transplantation, consideration should be given to novel treatment approaches for these patients.\n",
      "Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) can be treated successfully with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) leading to long-term disease-free survival. Leukemia relapse, however, remains a significant clinical problem. Relapse following BMT presumably results from the expansion of small numbers of recipient leukaemic cells which have survived the conditioning therapy. In order to define patients who are at a high risk of leukaemia relapse, a variety of techniques have been employed to detect persistence of host haemopoiesis (mixed chimaerism, MC) or residual leukaemia (minimal residual disease, MRD). However, the precise relationship between the detection of MC and MRD post-BMT is unknown. We have investigated chimaerism and MRD status in 22 patients who were in clinical and haematological remission post-allogeneic BMT for chronic phase CML. Chimaerism was assessed using short tandem repeat PCR (STR-PCR) while BCR-ABL mRNA detection using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the presence of MRD. Seventeen patients received unmanipulated marrow (non-TCD) while in five patients a T cell-depleted transplant (TCD) was performed as additional GVHD prophylaxis. Chimaerism was evaluated in 18 patients (14 non-TCD, four TCD). Mixed chimaerism was an uncommon finding in recipients of unmanipulated BMT (21%) when compared to TCD BMT (100%). No evidence of MRD, as identified using the BCR-ABL mRNA RT-PCR assay, was detected in those patients who were donor chimaeras. Early and transient MC and MRD was detected in four patients (two non-TCD, two TCD) who have subsequently converted to a donor profile. One patient has stable low-level MC but remains MRD negative 4 years post-BMT. Late MC and MRD was observed in two patients who relapsed >6 years after TCD BMT for CML. We conclude that mixed chimaerism is a rare event in recipients of unmanipulated BMT and that donor chimaerism as detected by STR-PCR assay is consistent with disease-free survival and identifies patients with a low risk of leukaemic relapse post-BMT for CML.\n",
      "Haemostatic complication is common for patients with hematologic malignancies. Recent studies suggest that the procoagulant activity (PCA) of extracellular vesicles (EV) may play a major role in venous thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in acute leukaemia. To study the impact of EVs from leukaemic patients on thrombin generation and to assess EV-PCA as a potential biomarker for thrombotic complications in patients with acute leukaemia. Blood samples from a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia were obtained before treatment (D-0), 3 and 7 days after treatment (D-3 and D-7). Extracellular vesicles were isolated and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. EV-PCA was assessed by thrombin generation assay, and EV-associated tissue factor activity was measured using a commercial bio-immunoassay (Zymuphen MP-TF®). Of the 53 patients, 6 had increased EV-PCA at D-0 and 4 had a thrombotic event. Patients without thrombotic events (n = 47) had no elevated EV-PCA. One patient had increased EVs with procoagulant activity at D-3 and developed a DIC at D-5. This patient had no increased EVs-related tissue factor activity from D-0 to D-7 (<2 pg/ml). Eight patients had increased EVs with tissue factor activity (>2 pg/ml), of these, four had a thrombosis and two had haemorrhages. Procoagulant activity of extracellular vesicles could have a predictive value in excluding the risk of thrombotic events. Our findings also suggest a possible association between thrombotic events and EV-PCA.\n",
      "A wealth of literature spanning 20 years describing cytogenetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) already exists. It ranges from single case reports of unusual abnormalities to large multicentre studies of hundreds of cases. A landmark publication was the Fourth International Workshop on Chromosomes in Acute Leukaemia which established a base line for diagnosis, prognosis and frequency of chromosome abnormalities in AML. Two large sources of information are a book, 'The Chromosomes in Human Cancer and Leukemia' and a catalogue of chromosome abnormalities, which aims to list all chromosome abnormalities described in the scientific and medical literature from 1973, when the widespread use of banding techniques, enabled the precise definition of the chromosome breakpoints. In this review the common cytogenetic abnormalities seen in AML with reference to associations with the French-American-British (FAB) classification, their possible prognostic significance and their associated molecular biology are summarized.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Individuals with Down syndrome have a greater risk of leukaemia than the general population, but reliable estimates of the age-specific risk are lacking and little is known about the risk of solid tumours. METHODS: We identified 2814 individuals with Down syndrome from the Danish Cytogenetic Register, and linked the data to the Danish Cancer Registry. The number of person-years at risk was 48453. Standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and 95% CI were calculated of the basis of cancer rates specific for age and sex in the general population. FINDINGS: 60 cases of cancer were found, with 49.8 expected (SIR 1.20 [95% CI 0.92-1.55]). Leukaemia constituted 60% of cases of malignant disease overall and 97% of cases in children. The SIR for leukaemia varied with age, being 56 (38-81) at age 0-4 years and 10 (4-20) at 5-29 years. No cases of leukaemia were seen after the age of 29 years. The SIR for acute myeloid leukaemia was 3.8 (1.7-8.4) times higher than that for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children aged 0-4 years. The cumulative risk for leukaemia by the age of 5 years was 2.1% and that by 30 years was 2.7%. Only 24 solid tumours were seen, with 47.8 expected (0.50 [0.32-0.75]). No cases of breast cancer were found, with 7.3 expected (p=0.0007). Higher than expected numbers of testicular cancers, ovarian cancers, and retinoblastomas were seen but were not significant. INTREPRETATION: The occurrence of cancer in Down syndrome is unique with a high risk of leukaemia in children and a decreased risk of solid tumours in all age-groups. The distinctive pattern of malignant diseases may provide clues in the search for leukaemogenic genes and tumour-suppressor genes on chromosome 21.\n",
      "Indeterminate cell histiocytosis (ICH) is a proliferation of indeterminate CD1a+, CD68+, S100+ and CD207- dermal dendritic cells. We describe a 39-year-old man who developed diffuse ICH and, 6 years later, acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). He was treated with cyclophosphamide, etoposide and vinblastine until 2003. In August 2004, he presented dyspnoea, hyperpyrexia and infiltration of the lung parenchyma, compatible with an AML invasion, and died after a course of induction chemotherapy. Cytomorphology and immunophenotype analyses suggested an ICH clonal evolution. The leukaemogenic role of etoposide is discussed. ICH has previously been reported in association with B-cell malignancy, but only one case has shown systemic progression.\n",
      "The relationship between neonatal vitamin K received by the intramuscular (i.m.) route and the development of leukaemia or other cancers was investigated as part of a national case-control study of childhood cancer, using data abstracted from obstetric and neonatal records. The analyses included 2530 children diagnosed with cancer before 15 years of age, 1174 of whom had leukaemia and 4487 control children without cancer. Overall, 39% of cases and 42% of controls had records of i.m. vitamin K administration, while 24% of cases and 22% of controls had no record of whether or not they had received vitamin K. Using subjects who received i.m. vitamin K as the baseline group, our analyses found no association between the administration of i.m. vitamin K and either leukaemia or other cancers as a group. We conclude that there is no convincing evidence that neonatal vitamin K administration, irrespective of the route by which it is given, influences the risk of children developing leukaemia or any other cancer.\n",
      "Seven populations of human leukaemic cells were implanted i.v. into sublethally irradiated severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice. Growth of leukaemia was monitored by labelling murine peripheral blood (PB) cells with an anti-HLA monoclonal antibody and flow cytometric analysis. Two of the populations transplanted were fresh acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) bone marrow (BM) cells which both caused sustained proliferative growth in scid mice. Human cells accounted for up to a mean of 87% of the total nucleated cells (TNC) in the PB of these mice between weeks 12-15. One of these populations was passaged into fresh mice and frank leukaemia was again established. Three populations of cryopreserved acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) cells (2 obtained from PB and 1 from BM) and one population of cryopreserved biphenotypic acute leukaemia BM cells, only grew to a maximum of 4% within the 15 week period of the experiment. A cell population from an AML cell line (HL60), however, did engraft and proliferate resulting in a rapid deterioration of these mice between weeks 3-6 when the proportion of human cells accounted for 9% of the TNC in the PB.\n",
      "The percentage of non-cycling blast cells in children with untreated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was investigated by staining smears for statin, a nuclear protein specifically present in non-growing resting cells. Results were compared with purified normal CD34-positive progenitors. A low fraction of ALL and CD34-positive cells expressed statin (2.9 +/- 3.8% and 2.8 +/- 3.1%, respectively), the growth fraction assessed by staining for the nucleolar antigen p120 was 94% in both ALL and CD34-positive cell samples. From this analysis it can be concluded that the compartment of non-replicating cells in ALL as well as in normal CD34-positive precursor cells collected from peripheral blood is very small and that most cells are cycling.\n",
      "Evidence of an immune mediated graft-versus-leukaemia effect has led to the belief that T and NK cell based adoptive immunotherapy can constitute effective treatment for relapsed leukaemias. However, work on solid tumours has shown this strategy may be hampered, by an immune escape mechanism in which tumour secreted immunosuppressive factors compromise T and NK cell function. Indeed, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells secrete immunosuppressive factors that block the synthesis of Th1 type cytokines in T cells. We demonstrate here that this immunosuppression, mediated by both HL60 AML cell line and primary AML blasts, inhibits T and NK cell proliferation but not cytolytic activity. Supernatants from HL60 cell line and primary AML blasts inhibited T cell proliferation to mitogenic and alloantigen stimulation but had no effect on cytolytic function. Similarly, the proliferation of NK cells to IL-2 and IL-15 stimulation was inhibited whilst their cytolytic function, shown by lysis of AML blasts, K562 and Daudi cells remained unaffected. The failure of T and NK cells to proliferate was not due to effector cell apoptosis. Indeed, removal of lymphocytes from the immunosuppressive environment partially restored their capacity to respond to mitogenic stimulation. T cells exposed to immunosuppressive supernatants did not increase expression of mitotic inhibitory proteins that arrest cell division, thereby ruling this out as a mechanism of operation for this immunosuppression. T cell expansion requires antigen stimulation, usually provided in the form of AML blasts, therefore our data suggest that NK cells may be more practical for the immunotherapy of AML.\n",
      "We report here an uncommon case of neonatal acute leukaemia that presented concomitant with serological evidence of rubella infection. The clinical course was aggressive and the patient died 5 days after diagnosis from septicaemia. Leukaemic blasts had a mixed lineage immunophenotype co-expressing a constellation of B-lymphoid (CD19, cytCD22, TdT) and myeloid (CD13, CD33, CD14, anti-MPO) markers, as well as multiple adhesion molecules and markers associated with early lympho-myeloid progenitor cells (CD34, CD7, HLA-DR). A previously unrecorded discordant expression of different CD10 and CD34 epitopes was identified using different monoclonal antibodies. The karyotype was 46,XX t(4;11)(q21;q23) and molecular analysis confirmed rearrangement of the trithorax-related oncogene HRX at 11q23. There was a clonal biallelic rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene. The features of this rare case have implications for possible aetiological events leading to leukaemia.\n",
      "The diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is based on clinical and laboratory features. Morphology and immunophenotype are the key initial diagnostic tests. In cases with atypical features, these investigations should be complemented with cytogenetics and/or histology to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude other B-cell disorders. Morphologically, CLL can be classified into typical and atypical forms. Cell-marker studies provide a robust foundation to establish the diagnosis as the lymphocytes have a distinct immunophenotypic signature. Although no single antigen is exclusively expressed in CLL cells, when several markers are compounded into a scoring system the results allow firming up of the diagnosis. Other immunological markers, such as CD38 or ZAP-70, have an important prognostic impact. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis also provides prognostic information, chiefly by detecting 17 (p53 locus) and 11q deletion, and may determine the type of therapy.\n",
      "We report a 33-year-old man with Ph chromosome-positive CML who underwent an allogeneic BMT from an unrelated donor. DNA microsatellite studies showed complete donor chimaerism immediately after BMT followed by mixed chimaerism; by day + 45 haematopoiesis was exclusively of recipient origin. Throughout the first year post-transplant all marrow metaphases were Ph negative but with non-clonal rearrangements consistent with autologous recovery. Cytogenetic relapse of leukaemia was first detected 15 months post-transplant. This case is unusual in that non-malignant stem cells of recipient origin survived the transplant and reconstituted haematopoiesis very early after BMT. Later the leukaemic cells reasserted their 'proliferative' advantage.\n",
      "Inositol hexaphosphate (IP(6)), a naturally polyphosphorylated carbohydrate, has been reported to have significant in vivo and in vitro anticancer activity against numerous tumours, such as colon, prostate, breast, liver and rhabdomyosarcomas. To confirm this activity in haematological malignancies and to characterize some of the mechanisms of IP(6) action, we analysed its effects on human leukaemic cell lines and fresh chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) progenitor cells using a combined cellular and molecular approach. IP(6) had a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on all of the evaluated cell lines, with accumulation in the G2M phase in two out of five cell lines tested. At the molecular level, cDNA microarray analysis after IP(6) exposure showed an extensive downmodulation of genes involved in transcription and cell cycle regulation and a coherent upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors. Furthermore, IP(6) treatment of fresh leukaemic samples of bone marrow CD34+ CML progenitor cells significantly inhibited granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) formation (P = 0.0062) in comparison to normal bone marrow specimens, which were not affected. No differentiating effect on HL60 cells was observed. Taken together, our results confirm the antiproliferative activity of IP(6) and suggest that it may have a specific antitumour effect also in chronic myeloid leukaemias, via active gene modulation.\n"

      "Peripheral blood specimens, obtained from 71 patients with newly-diagnosed acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) prior to the initiation of therapy, were assayed for the presence of a myeloid leukaemia-associated cell surface antigen identified by monoclonal antibody YB5.B8. The antibody bound to cells from 22 patients, and these patients had a poorer overall survival rate than those whose cells failed to bind the antibody (p less than 0.025). Fifty patients were treated with daunorubicin/cytosine arabinoside/6-thioguanine (DAT) according to a standard protocol and survived at least to the end of the induction phase (7 days). Of the 34 patients whose cells were YB5.B8 negative, 28 obtained a complete remission. In contrast, only four of the 16 patients whose cells expressed YB5.B8 antigen obtained complete remission (p less than 0.001). Expression of the YB5.B8 antigen in ANLL appears to be a strong prognostic indicator which is independent of other known prognostic factors such as patient age, leucocyte count and pre-existing hematopoietic abnormality.\n",
      "AIMS: To investigate the relationship between extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) exposure and mortality from leukaemia and brain tumour in a cohort of Swiss railway workers. METHODS: 20,141 Swiss railway employees with 464,129 person-years of follow-up between 1972 and 2002 were studied. Mortality rates for leukaemia and brain tumour of highly exposed train drivers (21 muT average annual exposure) were compared with medium and low exposed occupational groups (i.e. station masters with an average exposure of 1 muT). In addition, individual cumulative exposure was calculated from on-site measurements and modelling of past exposures. RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) for leukaemia mortality of train drivers was 1.43 (95% CI 0.74 to 2.77) compared with station masters. For myeloid leukaemia the HR of train drivers was 4.74 (95% CI 1.04 to 21.60) and for Hodgkin disease 3.29 (95% CI 0.69 to 15.63). Lymphoid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin disease and brain tumour mortality were not associated with magnetic field exposure. Concordant results were obtained from analyses based on individual cumulative exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Some evidence of an exposure-response association was found for myeloid leukaemia and Hodgkin disease, but not for other haematopoietic and lymphatic malignancies and brain tumours.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Patients with leukaemia are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. There are limited outcomes data for patients with a history of leukaemia who present with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2004-2014) for patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of AMI, and a concomitant diagnosis of leukaemia, and further stratified according to the subtype of leukaemia. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify the association between leukaemia and major acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE; composite of mortality, stroke and cardiac complications) and bleeding. RESULTS: Out of 6 750 878 AMI admissions, a total of 21 694 patients had a leukaemia diagnosis. The leukaemia group experienced higher rates of MACCE (11.8% vs 7.8%), mortality (10.3% vs 5.8%) and bleeding (5.6% vs 5.3%). Following adjustments, leukaemia was independently associated with increased odds of MACCE (OR 1.26 [1.20, 1.31]) and mortality (OR 1.43 [1.37, 1.50]) without an increased risk of bleeding (OR 0.86 [0.81, 0.92]). Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was associated with approximately threefold risk of MACCE (OR 2.81 [2.51, 3.13]) and a fourfold risk of mortality (OR 3.75 [3.34, 4.22]). Patients with leukaemia were less likely to undergo coronary angiography (CA) (48.5% vs 64.5%) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (28.2% vs 42.9%) compared with those without leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Patients with leukaemia, especially those with AML, are associated with poor clinical outcomes after AMI, and are less likely to receive CA and PCI compared with those without leukaemia. A multi-disciplinary approach between cardiologists and haematology oncologists may improve the outcomes of patients with leukaemia after AMI.\n",
      "We have developed a sensitive, competitive, nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) titration assay that quantifies the number of Wilm tumour (WT1) gene transcripts in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), coupled with a competitive RT-PCR protocol for the ABL gene as control. We studied BM/PB samples from 107 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and 22 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients at presentation and detected the WT1 gene in > 90% of patients by a qualitative assay. Quantitative analysis of WT1 transcript at presentation in 66 patients (52 AML, 14 ALL) correlated significantly with remission rate, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.003). WT1 levels were normalized to 105ABL transcripts. Within good and standard cytogenetic risk groups, high WT1 levels correlated with poorer outcome. Serial quantification was performed in 35 patients (28 AML, seven ALL); those with less than 103 copies of WT1 after induction and second consolidation chemotherapy had significantly better DFS and OS. Fourteen patients have relapsed with a median complete remission duration of 12 (range 4-49) months. We detected a rise in WT1 levels in nine out of 14 patients, 2-4 months before the onset of haematological relapse, whereas in the remaining five patients, WT1 levels remained persistently high during the disease course. WT1 levels were lower in PB than in BM, but mirrored changes in the BM samples and were equally informative. We suggest that WT1 is a useful molecular target to monitor minimal residual disease in acute leukaemia, especially in cases without a specific fusion gene.\n",
      "CD13 has proved to be a useful cell surface marker for depicting haematopoietic cells of the myeloid and monocytic lineages. Sequence data has shown CD13 to bear strong homology to Aminopeptidase-N. Expression of this antigen on myeloid leukaemic cells is, however, variable. We have looked at the effects of a phorbol ester PMA and a haematopoietic growth factor GM-CSF on the expression of CD13 displayed by a selected group of myeloid leukaemias at presentation and by normal peripheral blood granulocytes. We have found that PMA but not GM-CSF was able to stimulate CD13 expression on fresh myeloid leukaemic cells but granulocytes were stimulated by either PMA or GM-CSF. In addition, we have correlated CD13 expression with Aminopeptidase-N enzyme activity on fresh myeloid leukaemic cells. These results suggest that CD13 is functionally active on leukaemic cells and normal granulocytes.\n",
      "In a national case-control study in Sweden, we investigated whether in rural areas (where susceptible individuals are more prevalent than in urban areas) leukaemia risk was higher among the young children of fathers with many work contacts, as the infective hypothesis has predicted. A total of 1935 cases diagnosed in 1958-1998 together with 7736 age-matched (within 1 year) population controls (of whom 970 and 3880 respectively were aged 0-4) were linked to paternal occupational details as recorded in the census closest to the year of birth. Applying the two classifications of occupational contact level used in a study of rural Scotland, the odds ratios for children aged 0-4 years in the highest contact category (which includes teachers) in the most rural Swedish counties were 3.47 (95% CI 1.54, 7.85) and 1.59 (1.07, 2.38) respectively, relative to the medium and low (reference) category; no such excess was found in urban or intermediate counties. There was also a significant positive trend at ages 0-4 in the rural counties across the three levels of increasing occupational contact (P for trend 0.02 and 0.03, respectively), but again not in the urban or intermediate counties. No such effect or trend was found at ages 5-14 in any of the three county groupings. The findings confirm those of a recent study in rural Scotland, and also suggest that unusual population mixing (as occurred in Scotland as a result of the North Sea oil industry) is not a necessary requirement for the effect, since comparable mixing has not been a feature of rural Sweden.\n",
      "Twenty-three cytopenic episodes in 18 patients undergoing ablative chemotherapy for the treatment of leukaemia or lymphoma were monitored from commencement of treatment until recovery, by automated differential counts using the Technicon H*1 Autoanalyser, with particular reference to abnormal white cell flags and large unstained cell (LUC) percentage. The blast flag was indicated in this recovery phase in 100% of patients and in 85% this preceded bone marrow recovery (defined as neutrophil count greater than 0.5 X 10(9)/l) by a mean of 10 days. On average the blast flag was indicated for 8 days in total. Bone marrow function continued to improve in all patients with no evidence of relapse. An increase in the LUC percentage on the differential count reached a maximum at 18 days, 6 days prior to marrow recovery. The ability to detect impending marrow recovery by means of the positive blast flag, may be of great value when patients have been cytopenic for many days.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: In the United Kingdom (UK), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) makes up 40 % of all leukaemias in patients over 65 years. The study objective was to obtain societal preferences in the UK for \"progression-free\" and \"progressive\" states of late-stage CLL, refractory to current first and second line regimens. Preferences were also obtained for selected treatment-related adverse events (AEs). METHODS: A utility elicitation study, using the time trade-off (TTO) method, was conducted by face-to-face interviews with 110 subjects for a baseline disease state (before treatment), three primary disease states [progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment responder, PFS and treatment non-responder and disease progression], and 4 AE sub-states (PFS responder with thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and infection, and PFS non-responder with infection). TTO scores were converted into utility values, and disutilities were calculated for AEs. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were obtained. RESULTS: The primary disease state mean TTO utility scores were: baseline: 0.549; PFS response: 0.671; PFS non-response: 0.394; and progression: 0.214. The mean TTO utility (disutility) scores for the AEs were: PFS response with thrombocytopenia, 0.563 (-0.108), neutropenia, 0.508 (-0.163), and infection, 0.476 (-0.195); PFS non-response with infection, 0.333 (-0.061). The VAS results were in line with the TTO results. CONCLUSIONS: The utility was higher for the PFS state than baseline, but decreased below baseline in non-response and disease progression states. AEs had an impact on utility within the PFS response state. The severe infection AE had a greater impact on utilities for the responding to treatment state compared to the non-responder state.\n",
      "In a case-control study of second primary cancers in Moscow, there were 165 cases and 294 controls, matched for site of first primary, duration of follow-up since first primary and relapse history. Of the cases, 18 were of acute, non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL), with 39 matched controls. Risk of ANLL was assessed with respect to chemotherapy for the first primary tumour. The chemotherapeutic agents investigated were nitrogen mustard, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, vincristine, prednisone and combinations. Increased risks were associated with use of nitrogen mustard (odds ratio = 9.94, not significant), doxorubicin (odds ratio = 11.25, 0.1 > P > 0.05) and vincristine (odds ratio = 26.57, P < 0.05). Despite the small number of cases and potential confounding by other agents, these findings, together with those of previous studies, suggest that some non-alkylating agents may predispose to second malignancies.\n",
      "The World Health Organization classification of haematolymphoid tumours recognizes three categories of natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms: blastic NK-cell lymphoma, aggressive NK-cell leukaemia, and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type. Recent studies indicate that CD4+CD56+ blastic NK-cell lymphoma is of plasmacytoid dendritic cell origin, and true tumours of precursor NK-cell origin may be present mainly in the CD4-CD56+ subset. Myeloid/NK-cell precursor acute leukaemia may also develop from precursor NK cells. However, because the developmental pathway of normal NK cells is not well understood, tumours of precursor NK-cell origin are not clearly identified. Among mature NK-cell tumours, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is relatively common in Asia and Latin America. In localized disease, chemoradiotherapy seems to be promising, and in advanced disease, new combination chemotherapies are under active investigation. Aggressive NK-cell leukaemia is rare and has a poor prognosis. Because NK-cell neoplasms are rare and difficult to manage, rigorous studies are required for their understanding and management.\n",
      "Chronic eosinophilic leukaemia associated with the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene (F/P+ CEL) is a rare cause of marked persistent hypereosinophilia, arising almost exclusively in male patients. Clinical presentations are heterogeneous with a higher incidence of eosinophil-mediated cardiomyopathy than in other hypereosinophilic syndrome variants. Features of chronic myeloproliferative disease are often present, including splenomegaly and elevated serum vitamin B12 levels. The diagnosis is made by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showing the deletion of the CHIC2 locus and/or RT-PCR showing the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion transcript. Treatment with imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, results in rapid and complete resolution of hypereosinophilia and associated symptoms, except for those related to sub-endocardial fibrosis that may be irreversible. We report the case of a male patient in whom isolated intractable cough remained the only clinical manifestation of F/P+ CEL for 4 years. Furthermore, eosinophil autofluorescence, an as yet unreported artefact in this setting, precluded the detection of the CHIC2 deletion and further delayed diagnosis, underlining that both FISH and RT-PCR should be performed when this disease is suspected.\n",
      "CD4(+)/CD56(+) haematodermic neoplasm or 'early' plasmacytoid dendritic cell leukaemia/lymphoma (pDCL) was described as a disease entity in the last World Health Organisation/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer classification for cutaneous lymphomas. These leukaemia/lymphomas co-express CD4 and CD56 without any other lineage-specific markers and have been identified as arising from plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Despite a fairly homogeneous pattern of markers expressed by most pDCL, numerous distinctive features (e.g. cytological aspects and aberrant marker expression) have been reported. This may be related to the 'lineage-independent developmental' programme of dendritic cells, which may be able to develop from either immature or already committed haematopoietic progenitors. This highlights the need for specific validated markers to diagnose such aggressive leukaemia. Here, we propose--among others (e.g. T-cell leukaemia 1)--blood dendritic cell antigen-2 and high levels of CD123 expression as potential markers. In addition, we propose a multidisciplinary approach including several fields of haematology to improve pDCL diagnosis.\n",
      "AIMS: Proliferation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) occurs in both reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and myeloproliferative disorders, especially chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. PDCs in the former appear reactive, but in the latter are reported to be clonally related to the underlying myeloid neoplasm. Langerhans cells (LCs), another type of dendritic cell, also proliferate in both reactive dermatoses and, rarely, myeloproliferative disorders, such as acute leukaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a rare case of tumorous proliferation of PDCs and LCs in the systemic lymph nodes in a 55-year-old man with acute myeloid leukaemia. A microsatellite instability assay showed identical patterns of short tandem repeats in both microdissected PDC and LC components, along with blood blasts. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the combined proliferations of PDCs and LCs derive from the same haematopoietic stem cells, but that they differentiate divergently under the effect of different microenvironments.\n",
      "AIMS: To investigate proliferative activity in leukaemic and lymphomatous bone marrow infiltrates and to assess the feasibility of transport of specimens among institutions. METHODS: Proliferative activity in bone marrow trephine cryosections from 99 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 23 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 11 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and two with acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) was investigated. Infiltration was seen in 52 out of 99 cases of NHL on bone marrow cryosections. A score was devised to assess pathological infiltrates in bone marrow trephine cryosections using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. This method of scoring gave a measure of non-erythroid proliferative activity. RESULTS: Mean Ki-67 positivity in bone marrow infiltrates in 31 low grade B cell lymphomas (Kiel classification) was 0.3% before and 4.7% after treatment, 16.4% in seven high grade B cell lymphomas, and 17.8% in 12 peripheral T cell lymphomas. In 48 cases of NHL, bone marrow cryosections had not been infiltrated, and in all but one case the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells in normal marrow was less than 3%; the remaining case showed coexistent myelodysplasia and 8% bone marrow Ki-67 positivity. In eight cases of common ALL at diagnosis, the mean Ki-67 positivity in marrow cryosections was 24.9%, significantly higher than the 2.4% Ki-67 positivity seen in AML (p < 0.05). One of the two cases of common ALL with less than 1% Ki-67 positivity was refractory to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Proliferative activity of erythroid elements in the bone marrow varies greatly. Immunostaining of bone marrow cryosections using Ki-67 permits accurate assessment of non-erythroid proliferative activity in lymphomas and leukaemia. High grade B cell lymphomas and peripheral T cell lymphomas invading the marrow have very similar mean proliferative activities. Such levels of proliferation are of the same order as those seen in common ALL, but much higher than those seen in AML.\n",
      "Activation of the Evi-1 gene was first described to be associated with the transformation of murine myeloid leukaemias and has previously been detected in cases of human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in blast crises and in myelodysplastic syndromes. In this study we determined the frequency and the level of Evi-1 expression in juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) and in normal haemopoiesis. Using RT-PCR and Southern blot hybridization mRNA of Evi-1 could be detected in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNC) of normal donors. In JMML 12/20 patients examined expressed elevated levels of Evi-1 compared to normal controls. In these samples over-expression of the gene was correlated with a higher percentage of blasts (P = 0.02). Expression levels in BFU-E and CFU-GM derived colonies from BM of JMML patients were lower than those in the corresponding MNC samples. Analysis of CD34+ and CD34- cells demonstrated that Evi-1 is primarily expressed in the CD34+ cell population of both JMML and normal donors. These findings suggest that Evi-1 expression is linked to the early stages of haemopoiesis. Studies on the regulation of Evi-1 expression in CD34+ cells will elucidate its function in progenitor cells and clarify its possible role in the pathogenesis of JMML.\n",
      "Fifteen patients with leukaemia and myelodysplasia (n = 10) or non-malignant disease (5) received a second and one a third BMT following recurrence of malignancy (7), rejection (5) or failure of engraftment (4). Of seven patients retransplanted for relapse, 3 of 3 who were conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI) for the first and chemotherapy for the second BMT relapsed whereas 0 of 4 who were conditioned with busulphan (BU) and CY for the first and TBI and melphalan for the second BMT relapsed. Three of these patients survive disease-free for longer than the remission after first BMT. Four patients with non-malignant disease received a second allogeneic BMT following failure of sustained engraftment and three are well and disease free for 24-75 months. Five patients received an autologous rescue because of failure of sustained engraftment. Three had sustained marrow recovery, with two patients surviving (one free of leukaemia and one with thalassaemia major), 41 and 77 months post-BMT. It is concluded that second allogeneic BMT can lead to prolonged disease-free survival and that TBI/melphalan may be a suitable conditioning therapy for second BMT in patients relapsing after BU/CY. Collection of an autologous back-up provides an additional safety measure in patients at increased risk of failure of sustained engraftment.\n",
      "Improvements in survival in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have yet to be gleaned from either refinements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease or from the expanding pool of targeted therapies. Outcomes have remained particularly dismal in older patients. Ongoing and planned trials will assess the effects of drugs targeting biological pathways whose clinical importance may vary as a function of the unique genotype and phenotype of each case of AML. The success of these ventures will ultimately require well-designed clinical trials in subsets of patients with risk being dependent not only on age and cytogenetics, but on additional, increasingly quantifiable biological variables. Inhibitors of fms-like tyrosine kinase-3, farnesyl transferase, apoptotic and angiogenic pathways are being studied alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Biological therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, peptide vaccines and interleukin-2, are undergoing evaluation. The role of autologous as well as allogeneic myeloablative and reduced-intensity transplantation continues to be defined. Several potentially useful new cytotoxic agents are being introduced. Critically important to advancing the field in light of such an increasing number of choices is a reassessment of traditional phase II trial designs so that more efficient evaluation of new therapies may take place, even as well-designed phase III trials continue to be performed.\n",
      "To investigate the correlation between granulocyte-macrophage colony formation and the prognosis of acute myelocytic leukaemia, an in vitro colony formation assay using a practical method was performed at diagnosis in 50 patients newly diagnosed with acute myelocytic leukaemia. Granulocyte-macrophage colony counts were significantly lower in acute myelocytic leukaemia patients than in the control group (n = 5). The diminished colony formation was restored to within the normal range in 15 patients after complete remission was achieved. In eight patients, serial evaluation of granulocyte-macrophage colony formation was performed, and suppression of colony formation was observed at relapse. The comparison of granulocyte-macrophage colony counts at diagnosis between a group of patients with complete remission (n = 26) and a group of treatment failure cases (n = 24) revealed a significant difference suggesting that high counts of granulocyte-macrophage colony formation are predictive of a favourable prognosis for acute myelocytic leukaemia.\n",
      "VH4 gene rearrangements occur in a similar proportion of cases of B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and B chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B CLL). However, there may be differences in the pattern of VH4 gene usage between these disorders as is the case for VH1 gene rearrangements. To examine this, we analysed the sequences of 24 PCR-amplified clonal VH4 gene rearrangements from a series of 15 cases of ALL and nine cases of CLL. Five distinct groups of genes were rearranged, three of which (represented by V2-1, V71-2/V71-4, V4.21) have been described in rearranged form in normal B lymphoid tissues. The most frequently rearranged gene was V4.21 which is strongly associated with autoimmune reactivity. V71-2, V71-4 and V2-1 were more frequently rearranged in CLL than ALL. The remaining two groups (represented by V4.33, V4.35) have not previously been described in rearranged form. One of these, V4.35, was seen only in ALL rearrangements. Both V4.35 and a VH1 gene, 20P3, which is also preferentially rearranged in ALL, are located at the 3' end of the VH locus. The location of these genes suggests that their rearrangement may be developmentally regulated in ALL. The findings in this study confirm restricted repertoires of IgH gene rearrangement in ALL and CLL. Characterization of IgH repertoires provides a means of correlating these transformed B cell populations with normal B cell developmental compartments. Moreover, the distinctive repertoires in ALL and CLL may reflect important differences in the ontogenic timing and microenvironmental milieu of tumourigenesis in these disorders.\n",
      "The leukaemias, which are divided into chronic and acute forms, are malignant diseases of haematopoietic cells in which the proper balance between proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis is no longer operative. Genes, such as those of mixed-lineage leukaemia, AML1 and retinoic acid receptor alpha, have been found to be aberrantly fused to different partners, which often encode transcription factors or other chromatin modifying enzymes, in numerous types of acute lymphoid and myeloid leukaemias. These chimeric fusion oncoproteins, generated by reciprocal chromosomal translocations, are responsible for chromatin alterations on target genes whose expression is critical to stem cell development or lineage specification in haematopoiesis. Alterations in the 'histone code' or in the DNA methylation content occur as consequence of aberrant targeting of the corresponding enzymatic activities. Here, the author will review the most recent progress in the field, focusing on how fusion proteins generated by chromosomal translocation are responsible for chromatin alterations, gene deregulation and haematopoietic differentiation block and their implication for clinical treatment.\n",
      "A clinicopathological study was performed on 115 patients (56 males, 59 females; median age 48 yr) with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) to reveal initial clinical, but particularly histomorphological features of predictive value for survival. All patients had a trephine biopsy of the bone marrow and entered this study without prior selection. Overall survival was 36 +/- 27 months. In addition to multiple interactions between various disease features, multivariate regression analysis showed that of the clinical parameters age, liver size and level of LDH were primarily and most closely associated with prognosis. Of the histomorphological variables, megakaryocytes greater than 60 mm-2 bone marrow area and fibrosis displayed an unfavourable impact on survival on univariate calculation. On multivariate analysis, however, only pseudo-Gaucher cells remained significant, i.e. exerted an independent and favourable influence on prognosis. Histological features of predictive value were reviewed together with the different categories of a histopathological classification proposed for chronic myeloproliferative diseases by Georgii and co-workers.\n",
      "A simple reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (LC) method for the determination of urinary 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (m5dCyd), recently claimed (on the basis of an imuno-technique) to be a potential marker for leukaemia, has been developed. Sample pre-treatment is based on a microcolumn clean-up step with an average recovery of 79% and a RSD of 3%. Detection limit was 0.2 microg/ml which is about tenfold lower than levels previously measured by an ELISA method in urine of healthy individuals. The creatinine (Cre) excretion, necessary for normalising the m5dCyd excretion, was evaluated by ion-pair liquid chromatography which permitted the simultaneous determination of pseudouridine (psi), a modified nucleoside also potentially useful as a marker for leukaemia. The described LC procedures were applied to the analysis of urine samples from healthy individuals and leukaemia patients. While the urinary psi/Cre ratio was found significantly increased for leukaemia patients, the urinary m5dCyd levels in healthy individuals were below the detection limits and did not increase in presence of the malignant disease.\n",
      "Although recurrent malignancy is the most frequent indication for second stem cell transplantation (2nd SCT), there are few reports that include sufficiently large numbers of patients to enable prognostic factor analysis. This retrospective study includes 150 patients who underwent a 2nd SCT for relapsed acute myeloblastic leukaemia (n = 61), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 47) or chronic myeloid leukaemia (n = 42) after a first allogeneic transplant (including 26 T-cell-depleted). The median interval between the first transplant and relapse, and between relapse and second transplant was 17 months and 5 months respectively. After the 2nd SCT, engraftment occurred in 93% of cases, 32% of patients developed acute graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) >/= grade II and 38% chronic GVHD. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival were 32 +/- 8% and 30 +/- 8%, respectively, with a risk of relapse of 44 +/- 12% and a transplant-related mortality of 45 +/- 9%. In a multivariate analysis, five factors were associated with a better outcome after 2nd SCT: age < 16 years at second transplant; relapse occurring more than 12 months after the first transplant; transplantation from a female donor; absence of acute GVHD; and the occurrence of chronic GVHD. The best candidates for a second transplant are likely to be patients with acute leukaemia in remission before transplant, in whom the HLA-identical donor was female and who relapsed more than 1 year after the first transplant.\n",
      "Treatment of malignancy during pregnancy is difficult because of the potential teratogenicity of chemotherapeutic agents. Leucapheresis was employed in the initial management of a pregnant patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia. It was subsequently replaced with oral hydroxyurea during the second trimester. Successful delivery of a live male infant was achieved and the child has normal growth and development to date.\n",
      "Cytogenetic abnormalities found in four cases of T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) are described. An isochromosome 8q was found in three patients and a t(8;8) in one. In the four cases, karyotypes were complex and showed a high degree of instability. In addition, we reviewed 27 published cases of cytogenetically studied T-PLL. On the whole, the most frequently recurring anomalies in T-PLL are 14q lesions with nonrandom breakpoints, inversion (14)(q11q32) or tandem translocations (14;14) (not seen in any of our cases) and trisomy for 8q. mainly due to i(8q), found in more than 40% of patients each. Similar structural anomalies were found almost as frequently among the 23 cytogenetically studied cases of so-called T-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (T-CLL) reported prior to 1989. It is now accepted that the T-cell counterpart of B-CLL either does not exist or is exceedingly rare and thus previously reported cases of T-CLL sharing the chromosomal characteristics of T-PLL may well have been misdiagnosed examples of T-PLL. Isochromosomes 8q are exceptionally found in other types of haematological malignancies. However, i(8q) could not be shown to be the primary lesion in any case in T-PLL and the role of trisomy for 8q, as well of the associated monosomy 8p, is entirely unknown.\n",
      "In this survey for the presence of the feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) in the Singapore domestic cat population, the sera of two different groups of unvaccinated mainly short haired cats which were over 6 months old were sampled. The FeLV enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) diagnostic test kit was used to detect the presence of the FeLV group specific (gs) antigens in the blood of cats. Of the 345 clinically healthy cats surveyed, 34 sera (9.9%) were found to be positive and of the group of 123 cats with clinical signs such as chronic wasting, marked by anaemia, anorexia and lethargy, 33 sera (26.8%) were found to be positive. From the time of diagnosis of a viraemia, 70% of cats will die within 20 months. The results are therefore indicative that annually a small proportion of cats in the local environment will die from a FeLV infection. This survey reflects the natural distribution of an infectious oncovirus in a susceptible host population which is unaffected by any control programme to interfere with the normal sequence of events of host virus interactions.\n",
      "We introduce a procedure for generalized monotonic curve fitting that is based on a Bayesian analysis of the isotonic regression model. Conventional isotonic regression fits monotonically increasing step functions to data. In our approach we treat the number and location of the steps as random. For each step level we adopt the conjugate prior to the sampling distribution of the data as if the curve was unconstrained. We then propose to use Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to draw samples from the unconstrained model space and retain only those samples for which the monotonic constraint holds. The proportion of the samples collected for which the constraint holds can be used to provide a value for the weight of evidence in terms of Bayes factors for monotonicity given the data. Using the samples, probability statements can be made about other quantities of interest such as the number of change points in the data and posterior distributions on the location of the change points can be provided. The method is illustrated throughout by a reanalysis of the leukaemia data studied by Schell and Singh.\n",
      "Methodological considerations in the study of clusters and clustering of childhood cancer are reviewed briefly. A selection of 11 studies of individual clusters of childhood leukaemia which are either particularly notable or recent and have been reported in peer review journals is then considered. Focus is placed on sources of alerts, descriptive studies, field-work studies, conclusions and communication management. Some of these studies are probably essential but they are unlikely to yield firm conclusions; studies of large data sets are recommended. No causal factor has been identified which can explain a single cluster of childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "Previous studies have demonstrated the expression of GATA-1 (a DNA-binding nuclear protein) in erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, early marrow progenitor cells and in mouse and human erythroid leukaemia cell lines. We studied 31 bone marrow specimens from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) for GATA-1 expression by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) analysis. GATA-1 expression was detected in all of the patients with erythroleukaemia, and in one of nine patients with megakaryoblastic leukaemia, but absent from 17 patients with French-American-British (FAB) M1-5 leukaemia. In AML, GATA-1 expression is indicative of differentiation to the erythroid and possibly megakaryocytic lineages, analogous to its expression in normal haemopoiesis.\n",
      "Between 1978 and 1996 more than 7500 lymphoma transplants have been reported to the European Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Lymphoma Registry. This has been examined to establish the incidence of secondary leukaemia and myelodysplasia and to relate this to possible prognostic factors. 131 centres representing 4998 patients responded to a questionnaire. This identified 66 patients with post transplant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The actuarial risk for MDS/AML at 5 years post-transplant (+/-95% CI) was 4.6% (3.1-6.8) for Hodgkin disease and 3.0% (2.0-4. 3) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Multivariate analysis for all patients demonstrated an effect of age at transplant, radiotherapy at conditioning, number of transplants and interval between diagnosis and transplant as risk factors. For patients with NHL, grade of histology was important (low grade > intermediate or high-grade); for Hodgkin disease, female sex was identified as a risk factor. These findings suggest that the incidence of MDS/AML may not be greater following an autograft than after conventional chemotherapy.\n",
      "The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is a membrane receptor that mediates the endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Uptake of LDL has been proposed to contribute to chemotherapy resistance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines in vitro. In the present study, we analysed LDLR expression and survival using bone marrow biopsies from 187 intensively treated patients with AML. Here, increasing LDLR expression was associated with decreasing overall (58·4%, 44·2%, and 24·4%; P = 0·0018), as well as event-free survival (41·7%, 18·1%, and 14·3%; P = 0·0077), and an increasing cumulative incidence of relapse (33·9%, 55·1%, and 71·4%; P = 0·0011). Associations of LDLR expression with survival were confirmed in 557 intensively treated patients from two international validation cohorts. In the analytic and validation cohorts, LDLR expression remained associated with outcome in multivariable regression analyses including the European LeukemiaNet genetic risk classification. Thus, LDLR predicts outcome of patients with AML beyond existing risk factors. Furthermore, we found low expression levels of LDLR in most healthy tissues, suggesting it as a promising target for antibody-based pharmacodelivery approaches in AML.\n",
      "The differential diagnosis of acquired torticollis in infants and children comprises a large variety of disorders, including inflammation, neurologic disease or trauma. CONCLUSION: Spinal cord tumours in patients with ALL are a rarely reported entity and secondary spinal involvement in leukaemia presenting as head tilt is even more uncommon.\n",
      "A previously healthy 11-month-old male patient presented with fever, abdominal pain and irritability. As part of an extensive evaluation for the cause of his fevers, an echocardiogram was performed and showed mildly dilated coronary arteries, leading to a diagnosis of incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD). He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), defervesced and was discharged home. Two weeks later, he presented with anaemia initially attributed to haemolytic anaemia secondary to IVIG and received a red blood cell transfusion. However, his anaemia recurred 2  weeks later with leucocytosis, prompting a bone marrow aspirate 4  weeks after his diagnosis of KD. This demonstrated acute myelogenous leukaemia most consistent with acute megakaryocytic leukaemia. This case highlights the potentially subtle presentation of acute leukaemia and the need to keep an open mind and reconsider the initial diagnosis as new information comes to light in the care of an ill child.\n",
      "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a novel technique for the in vitro amplification of specific short DNA fragments, which permits a selective and up to 10(7) fold enrichment of the target sequence. The method is increasingly being used for the molecular genetic analysis of hereditary, infectious and neoplastic disorders. The use of PCR for the detection of minimal residual disease in particular types of leukaemia or lymphoma, such as chronic myelogenous leukaemia expressing specific BCR/ABL-RNA and follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma with the chromosomal translocation t(14;18) are reviewed. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia clone-specific sequences from rearranged antigen receptor genes may be molecular markers suitable for amplification. Although PCR holds great promise for \"molecular\" staging and follow-up, several technical problems have to be kept in mind, and the clinical relevance of PCR-based evidence of minimal residual disease in haematological malignancies requires further investigation.\n",
      "We develop a new parametric model using the three-parameter Burr XII distribution for the analysis of survival data with long-term survivors, which includes the previous Weibull mixture model as a special case. The new model is applied to the analysis of a set of leukaemia data for which previous attempts in the literature using traditional parametric models were unsatisfactory due to lack of fit. It is shown that the new model improves the fit to the leukaemia data significantly and is thus capable of providing more credible answers to a variety of statistical inference problems that are of interest to medical researchers and practitioners.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Mitoxantrone has been extensively used as a disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis. However, estimates of the associated risk of therapy-related acute leukaemia and cardiomyopathy have been derived from short-term studies. This study aimed to ascertain the long-term risk of therapy-related acute leukaemia or cardiomyopathy after mitoxantrone therapy for multiple sclerosis. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2010, 50 patients were treated with mitoxantrone at a single centre using a standard protocol (12 mg/m(2) body surface area monthly for 6 months as tolerated to a maximum of 72 mg/m(2) body surface area). Follow-up haematologic and echocardiographic data were collected in March 2011. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (30%) were excluded from analysis either because of lack of follow-up data, death due to non-cardiac and non-haematologic causes, or comorbid cardiovascular disease. The remaining 35 patients (70%) were followed for a median of 75 months (range: 9-103). The median cumulative mitoxantrone dose given was 72 mg/m(2) body surface area (range: 24-123). At the end of follow-up, no patients had developed therapy-related acute leukaemia. One patient suffered an asymptomatic drop in left ventricular ejection fraction from 55 to 47%. CONCLUSION: This series of patients followed for up to 8.5 years suggests that the risk of either therapy-related acute leukaemia or cardiomyopathy after mitoxantrone therapy for multiple sclerosis is low when patients are treated within standard protocol.\n",
      "Several case-control studies have evaluated associations between maternal smoking, alcohol consumption and illicit drug use during pregnancy and risk of childhood leukaemia. Few studies have specifically focused on infants (<1 year) with leukaemia, a group that is biologically and clinically distinct from older children. We present data from a Children Oncology Group case-control study of 443 infants diagnosed with acute leukaemia [including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)] between 1996 and 2006 and 324 population controls. Mothers were queried about their cigarette, alcohol and illicit drug use 1 year before and throughout pregnancy. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals [CI] were calculated using adjusted unconditional logistic regression models. Maternal smoking (>1 cigarette/day) and illicit drug use (any amount) before and/or during pregnancy were not significantly associated with infant leukaemia. Alcohol use (>1 drink/week) during pregnancy was inversely associated with infant leukaemia overall [OR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.43, 0.94], AML [OR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.28, 0.87], and leukaemia with mixed lineage leukaemia gene rearrangements ('MLL+') [OR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.36, 0.97]. While our results agree with the fairly consistent evidence that maternal cigarette smoking is not associated with childhood leukaemia, the data regarding alcohol and illicit drug use are not consistent with prior reports and are difficult to interpret. It is possible that unhealthy maternal behaviours during pregnancy, some of which carry potential legal consequences, may not be adequately measured using only self-report. Future case-control studies of childhood leukaemia that pursue these exposures may benefit from incorporation of validated instruments and/or biomarkers when feasible.\n",
      "Background. The phenotypes of patients with the recently discovered, dominant, ETV6-linked leukaemia predisposition and familial thrombocytopenia syndrome are variable, and the exact mechanism of leukaemogenesis remains unclear. Patients and Methods. Here, we present novel clinical and laboratory phenotypes of seven individuals from three families with ETV6 germline mutations and a refined genetic analysis of one child with additional high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (HD-ALL), aiming to elucidate second oncogenic hits. Results. Four individuals from two pedigrees harboured one novel or one previously described variant in the central domain of ETV6 (c.592C>T, p.Gln198* or c.641C>T, p.Pro241Leu, respectively). Neutropenia was an accompanying feature in one of these families that also harboured a variant in RUNX1 (c.1098_1103dup, p.Ile366_Gly367dup), while in the other, an autism-spectrum disorder was observed. In the third family, the index patient suffered from HD-ALL and life-threatening pulmonary mucor mycosis, and had a positive family history of 'immune' thrombocytopenia. Genetic analyses revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in the ETS domain of ETV6 (c.1136T>C, p.Leu379Pro) along with absence of heterozygosity of chromosome (10)(q21.2q21.3), yielding a biallelic leukaemia risk allele in ARID5B (rs7090445-C). The neutrophil function was normal in all individuals tested, and the platelet immune histochemistry of all three pedigrees showed delta-storage-pool defect-like features and cytoskeletal defects. Conclusions. Our clinical observations and results of high-resolution genetic analyses extend the spectrum of possible phenotypes cosegregating with ETV6 germline mutations. Further, we propose ARID5B as potential leukaemogenic cofactor in patients with ETV6-linked leukaemia predisposition and familial thrombocytopenia syndrome.\n",
      "With bone marrow autotransplants, favourable results are reported in subjects with leukaemia in first and second remission but not in those with advanced disease. Whether autotransplants are equivalent or superior to other therapies such as chemotherapy and allogeneic transplants is uncertain, since prospective trials are not reported and data analysis is confounded by selection of subjects and time-censoring. Major problems of autotransplants include difficulty in eradicating leukaemia in the subject, lack of the graft-versus-leukaemia effect associated with allotransplants, and reinfusion of leukaemia cells.\n",
      "Systematic, standardised pretransplant risk assessment is an important tool for predicting patient outcomes following allogeneic haematopoietic SCT (HSCT). To assess the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) risk score capacities for predicting patient outcomes following unmanipulated haploidentical blood and marrow transplantation (HBMT), we analysed 502 leukaemia patients who received transplants at our centre between 2008 and 2010. The cohort OS and leukaemia-free survival (LFS) were 72.1% and 68.1%, whereas the cumulative non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse incidences were 16.5% and 16.1%. According to univariate analysis, the values for OS, LFS and NRM were worse for an EBMT risk score of 6 (40.0, 40.0, 50.0%) than a score of 1 (83.1, 78.3, 8.4%). Hazard ratios steadily increased for each additional score point. Likewise, a higher EBMT risk score was associated with an increased relapse incidence. Importantly, the EBMT risk score prognostic value regarding OS, LFS, NRM and relapse was maintained in the multivariate analysis. Moreover, we also made a haploidentical EBMT (haplo-EBMT) risk score, which used number of HLA disparity instead of donor type, and the haplo-EBMT risk scores can also be used to predict patient outcomes following unmanipulated HBMT.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The interferon lambda 4 gene (IFNL4) regulates immune responses by controlling the production of IFNλ4, a type III interferon. We hypothesised that IFNλ4 could play a role in infection clearance or alloreactivity in patients with acute leukaemia who received a myeloablative 10/10 HLA-matched haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Therefore, we aimed to assess the association between recipient and donor IFNL4 genotype with post-HSCT survival outcomes in patients with acute leukaemia. METHODS: We did a two-stage retrospective cohort study using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) repository and database, in which nearly all patients underwent the procedure in the USA. We included patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or acute lymphocytic leukaemia, who received a HSCT at any age from an unrelated 10/10 HLA-matched donor, with a myeloablative conditioning regimen, between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2008, and had a pre-HSCT recipient or donor blood sample available. The discovery dataset included patients from an existing National Cancer Institute (NCI) cohort of the CIBMTR database, in which donor and recipient IFNL4 polymorphisms (rs368234815, rs12979860, and rs117648444) were genotyped with TaqMan assays. According to their genotype, donors and recipients were categorised into IFNL4-positive, if they had at least one copy of the allele that supports the production of IFNλ4, or IFNL4-null for the analyses. The findings were independently validated with patients from the DISCOVeRY-BMT cohort (validation dataset) with existing Illumina array genotype data. We also did a combined analysis using data from patients included in both the NCI and DISCOVeRY-BMT cohorts. FINDINGS: We assessed 404 patients (who had a HSCT from Jan 9, 2004, to Dec 26, 2008) in the discovery dataset and 1245 patients in the validation dataset (HSCT Jan 7, 2000, to Dec 26, 2008). The combined analysis included 1593 overlapping participants in both cohorts. Donor, but not recipient IFNL4-positive genotype was associated with increased risk of non-relapse mortality (HR 1·60, 95% CI 1·23-2·10; p=0·0005 in the discovery dataset; 1·22, 1·05-1·40; p=0·0072 in the validation dataset; and 1·27, 1·12-1·45; p=0·0001 in the combined dataset). Associations with post-HSCT overall survival were as follows: HR 1·24, 95% CI 1·02-1·51; p=0·034 in the discovery dataset; 1·10, 0·98-1·20; p=0·10 in the validation dataset; and 1·11, 1·02-1·22; p=0·018 in the combined dataset. INTERPRETATION: Prioritising HSCT donors with the IFNL4-null genotype might decrease non-relapse mortality and improve overall survival without substantially limiting the donor pool. If these findings are validated, IFNL4 genotype could be added to the donor selection algorithm. FUNDING: The National Cancer Institute Intramural Research Program.

      "Adoptive immune cell therapy represents one of the most promising fields of investigation in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Preliminary studies indicate that adoptive immune cell therapy can be used to restore the immunocompetence of allo-HSCT recipients towards widespread pathogens in the early post-transplant period. These strategies can be of fundamental importance in patients given a T-cell-depleted allograft, a type of transplant that has been performed increasingly over the last few years. A few seminal studies have recently documented that prevention/treatment of Epstein-Barr-virus-related lymphoproliferative disorders, human cytomegalovirus disease and invasive aspergillosis can be obtained through infusion of pathogen-specific T-cell lines or clones. Several efforts are also being directed towards the identification of strategies capable of selecting and/or strengthening specific graft-vs-leukaemia responses. In this regard, strategies of ex-vivo generation and expansion of clones or cell lines, specifically or preferentially leukaemia reactive, have been developed.\n",
      "A subpopulation of human lymphoid cells called natural killers is able to lyse certain normal and neoplastic targets in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. The molecules which enable them to recognize sensitive cells, or permit tumour cells to escape remain unknown. In the studies described here we have compared some of the plasma membrane characteristics of a NK-sensitive human leukaemia cell line (K562) with those of a partially resistant subclone derived from it (K562-Clone I). Gel electrophoresis of cell-surface proteins radiolabelled by lactoperoxidase-catalysed iodination, periodate-borohydride tritiation, or biosynthetically by incubation with [3H]fucose did not reveal any reproducible differences between the sensitive and resistant lines. However, analysis of glycolipids showed that Clone I incorporated significantly more fucose than did the parental line, and that it synthesized a minor population of complex structures not found in the original K562. A subclone of Clone I (Clone I-Con Ar1), made resistant to the toxic effects of concanavalin A, became sensitive once again to NK, and showed the parental glycolipid profile. These results suggest that the Clone I line, selected for resistance to NK, may have altered one or more of its intermediate oligosaccharides or pathways of fucose incorporation into glycolipid, and points to one process by which a tumor cell might modulate its surface to escape recognition by natural killers.\n",
      "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Mixed-phenotype acute leukaemia (MPAL) is a rare neoplasm with no definite treatment protocols and a distinctly poor outcome. Advancement in polychromatic flow cytometry has made its identification easier. This prospective study was designed to identify cases of MPAL and study their clinical presentation and haematological profile in a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated bone marrow aspirate samples of patients diagnosed as acute leukaemia (AL) on the basis of morphology were utilized for immunophenotyping. A comprehensive panel of fluorochrome-labelled monoclonal antibodies targeting myeloid, B-cell, T-cell and immaturity markers was utilized. The patients diagnosed to have MPAL, on the basis of the World Health Organization 2008 classification, were selected for further analyses. RESULTS: There were 15 (2.99%) patients with MPAL of the total 501 cases of AL. Seven were children, all males and mean age of 5.08±3.88 yr. Eight were adults, male:female=6:2 and mean age of 21.43±5.74 yr. Eight were diagnosed as B/myeloid and seven were T/myeloid. No association was observed between age and immunophenotype of MPAL. On morphology, 11 were diagnosed as AML and four as ALL, and no specific morphology of blasts was predictive of a MPAL. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: MPAL appeared to be a rare neoplasm (2.99% of AL cases). A comprehensive primary panel of monoclonal antibodies should be used to identify this neoplasm known to have a poor outcome.\n",
      "We report two patients with acute leukaemia who received emetogenic cytotoxic drugs and were on therapeutic doses of sodium valproate for epilepsy. Neither patient reported significant nausea nor vomited at any time during the chemotherapy, at times requiring no anti-emetic treatment whatsoever. We suggest that this absence of nausea was due to an anti-emetic effect of sodium valproate.\n",
      "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common paediatric cancer. Despite cure rates approaching 80%, resistance to treatment and disease relapse remain a significant clinical problem. Identification of the genes and biological pathways responsible for chemoresistance is therefore crucial for the design of novel therapeutic approaches aiming to improve patient survival. Mutations in the membrane transporter P-glycoprotein genes, genetic variations in drug-metabolising enzymes and defects in apoptotic pathways are mechanisms of chemoresistance common to a wide spectrum of cancers and also play a role in paediatric ALL. In addition, several recent microarray studies have identified transcriptional profiles specifically associated with chemoresistance and pointed to a number of potentially novel therapeutic targets. These microarray studies have shown that genes discriminating between clinically responsive and resistant leukaemias tend to be involved in cellular processes such as regulation of cell cycle, proliferation, and DNA repair. Here we review the outcomes of these microarray studies and also present our own investigations into apoptotic resistance to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in paediatric ALL. We present stratification of paediatric ALL by the profile of DNA damage response following ionising radiation (IR) in vitro. This approach allows classification of ALL tumours at presentation into IR-apoptotic sensitive and IR-apoptotic resistant. Furthermore, apoptotic resistant leukaemias exhibit abnormal response of NFkB pathway following irradiation and inhibition of this pathway can sensitise leukaemic cells to IR-induced DSBs.\n",
      "The immune system has the ability to control and destroy malignant calls. This has been demonstrated by the graft versus leukaemia effect and the use of donor lymphocyte infusions in peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Dendritic cells are potent antigen presenting cells and become activated after phagocytosing and processing antigen. During this process they up-regulate MHC, co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules and have the ability to stimulate naïve T-cells. Recent evidence has shown that dendritic cells can be loaded with tumour specific antigens and can be used to generate specific anti-tumour T-cell responses. Initial clinical studies using this technology have been promising and suggest that dendritic cells and T-lymphocytes can be utilised in developing therapies which target specific malignant clones.\n",
      "Patients express concerns about the safety of donated blood. Do they have similar concerns about potential 'blood substitutes' and does the way information is presented on these options alter patients' perceptions? A two (informational frame: gain or loss) by four (transfusion type: human donor blood, human haemoglobin, bovine haemoglobin or perfluorocarbon emulsion substitutes) by three (patient group: adult haemophiliac/leukaemia patients, relatives/friends of haemophiliac/leukaemia patients and controls) between-subjects design was used. There were 82 patients, 118 relatives/friends and 263 controls from the UK. Blood substitutes were perceived as being significantly less safe than donor blood. Perceptions of safety were greater when transfusion information (regardless of transfusion type or patient group) was presented as gains rather than losses. Different demographic and psychological factors predicted perceived safety (e.g. sex) and perceived risk (e.g. age and experience).\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) and/or the corresponding molecular rearrangements RUNX1/RUNX1T1 and CBFB/MYH11 [collectively referred to as core binding factor (CBF) AML] predict for a more favourable outcome in patients receiving cytarabine-anthracycline based induction and upon achievement of complete remission, high-dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy. However, 40-45% of these patients eventually relapse and die of their disease. Here, we review emerging molecular and therapeutic results that may be used to guide the clinical management of this subset of patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Integration of cytogenetic results with molecular genetic and epigenetic data refines the diagnosis, classification and risk-stratification of CBF AML. Clinical studies with targeting compounds (e.g. gemtuzumab ozogamicin, dasatinib) added to intensive chemotherapy appear beneficial both in younger and older patients, albeit the latter continue to have a significantly worse outcome than the former. Regularly molecular monitoring of disease during remission may provide a strategy for early therapeutic intervention before overt relapse. SUMMARY: Emerging evidence supports that novel diagnostic, treatment and molecular disease monitoring approaches may improve the prognosis of CBF AML.\n",
      "This cases series describes the profile of adult patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APt) at a referral hospital in Qatar. Of 34 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases diagnosed, 11(32%) were classified as APt. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was common at presentation (91%). Severe thrombocytopenia was seen in 73%, leukocytosis in 55% and severe anaemia in 45%. Only 2 patients were of the classic hypergranular type. In the remaining 9 patients, 3 morphological subtypes were recognized: microgranular variant (6 patients), hyperbasophilic (2 patients) and regular nuclear outline M3r (1 patient). Translocation t(15;17) was detected in 63% of cases. APL constitutes a high proportion of AML cases in Qatar, with considerable morphological heterogeneity and a oredominance of APL variants with unfavourable oresenting features.\n",
      "The overexpression of a cell-surface glycoprotein termed P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is frequently associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) in cell lines in vitro. To evaluate the implications of P-gp expression in clinical drug-resistance, we examined the expression of P-gp in fresh leukaemia cells from chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) patients in blast crisis. By using immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against P-gp, C219, we showed that leukaemia cells from three CML patients in blast crisis were P-gp negative at the stage when these patients were in complete remission, and that the cells showed high levels of P-gp expression at times when the same patients had relapsed and had not responded to chemotherapy. Six out of 11 patients (nine in the refractory state) were P-gp positive and they rarely responded to chemotherapy. These data suggest that the expression of P-gp is closely associated with drug-resistance in CML.\n",
      "Philadelphia chromosome negative and bcr/abl negative chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is an uncommon atypical CML. We describe a patient with this disorder who experienced an acute blastic transformation that resulted in rapid splenic enlargement and subsequent atraumatic splenic rupture. Clinically, spontaneous splenic rupture may be a difficult diagnosis to make and this case highlights the importance of considering atraumatic splenic rupture as a cause for unexplained abdominal pain in a patient with a haematological malignancy.\n",
      "The Technicon H-1 counter represents a refinement of the cytochemistry-based technology of its predecessors, the H6000 and the Hemalog-D. It also has a new channel, the basophil-lobularity channel, which is said to enhance the sensitivity of leukaemic blast detection in comparison with previous instruments. To evaluate this facility, 35 adult patients with acute leukaemia at different phases of their disease were monitored for the presence of circulating leukaemic blasts during a 4-week period. The ability of the H-1 to detect blasts was compared to a careful manual review of a blood and bone marrow smear. Using the latter review as the standard, the sensitivity was 83.8% with a specificity of 78%. Exclusion of patients with severe leucopenia (less than 1.0 x 10(9)/l) increased the specificity to 89%, with little alteration in the sensitivity. We were unable to confirm the high degree of sensitivity claimed in previous reports. The H-1 blast flag, however, would appear useful for screening patients who are off therapy or on maintenance regimens.\n",
      "Acute leukaemias express high levels of MYB which are required for the initiation and maintenance of the disease. Inhibition of MYB expression or activity has been shown to suppress MLL-fusion oncoprotein-induced acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), which are among the most aggressive forms of AML, and indeed MYB transcription has been reported to be regulated by the MLL-AF9 oncoprotein. This highlights the importance of understanding the mechanism of MYB transcriptional regulation in these leukaemias. Here we have demonstrated that the MLL-AF9 fusion protein regulates MYB transcription directly at the promoter region, in part by recruiting the transcriptional regulator kinase CDK9, and CDK9 inhibition effectively suppresses MYB expression as well as cell proliferation. However, MYB regulation by MLL-AF9 does not require H3K79 methylation mediated by the methyltransferase DOT1L, which has also been shown to be a key mediator of MLL-AF9 leukemogenicity. The identification of specific, essential and druggable transcriptional regulators may enable effective targeting of MYB expression, which in turn could potentially lead to new therapeutic approaches for acute myeloid leukaemia with MLL-AF9.\n",
      "Acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) is associated with risk factors that are largely unknown and with a heterogeneous response to treatment. Here, we provide a comprehensive quantitative understanding of AML proteomic heterogeneities and hallmarks by using the AML Proteome Atlas, a proteomics database that we have newly derived from MetaGalaxy analyses, for the proteomic profiling of 205 patients with AML and 111 leukaemia cell lines. The analysis of the dataset revealed 154 functional patterns based on common molecular pathways, 11 constellations of correlated functional patterns and 13 signatures that stratify the outcomes of patients. We find limited overlap between proteomics data and both cytogenetics and genetic mutations. Moreover, leukaemia cell lines show limited proteomic similarities with cells from patients with AML, suggesting that a deeper focus on patient-derived samples is needed to gain disease-relevant insights. The AML Proteome Atlas provides a knowledge base for proteomic patterns in AML, a guide to leukaemia cell line selection, and a broadly applicable computational approach for quantifying the heterogeneities of protein expression and proteomic hallmarks in AML.\n",
      "The treatment of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) in the elderly is a difficult and increasing problem. The elderly are generally less able to tolerate the intensive chemotherapy required to achieve a sustained remission, and there is an increased incidence of resistant disease in this age group. Granulocyte- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors have been demonstrated to shorten the duration of severe neutropenia following chemotherapy for solid tumours and after bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and the effect of these growth factors in the treatment of AML has been investigated in a number of trials using 2 distinct strategies. Growth factors may be administered following chemotherapy in an attempt to accelerate neutrophil recovery, and they may be given before and during chemotherapy with the aim to increase the number of leukaemic blast cells in cell cycle and enhance their responsiveness to chemotherapy. Both of these approaches have proved safe despite initial theoretical concerns regarding the expression of receptors for these growth factors on leukaemic cells. The results of trials using these growth factors in the treatment of AML in the elderly generally show a significant reduction in the duration of neutropenia following induction chemotherapy. However, consistent benefits with respect to morbidity and early mortality together with improvements in long term disease outcome have not been observed. The 'priming' approach using growth factors before and during induction chemotherapy has proved equally disappointing in failing to improve response rates or survival. The routine use of these growth factors in the treatment of AML in the elderly population as a whole would, therefore, not seem to be cost effective.\n",
      "Lymphocytotoxic (LCT) and platelet reactive (PR) antibody (Ab) responses were serially determined in 49 patients with acute leukaemia. LCTAb were found in 20 patients and occurred in 13 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and 7 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Four differing patterns of LCTAb responses could be defined. Thirteen of 22 subjects showed marked reduction or loss of LCTAb. Indirect platelet immunofluorescence, measured by flow cytometry, provided the most convenient means of detecting PRAb which were found in 11 subjects and generally showed moderate or weak reactivity.\n",
      "Three new boron compounds, dihydroxy (oxybiguanido) boron (iii) hydrochloride monohydrate (HB), guanidine biboric acid adduct (GB) and hydroxosalicyl hydroxomato boron (iii) (SHB) were studied to observe their antineoplastic effect, if any. Leukemic cells isolated from acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL) patients and chronic myeloid leukaemia patients (CML) and myeloid leukemia cell lines (HL 60 and U-937) showed cell growth inhibition after treatment with the boron compounds. MTT assay showed that the growth of metabolically active cells was inhibited by treatment with these drugs. The molecular mechanism by which SHB induced apoptosis in immature blast cells was also investigated by ladder formation in gel electrophoresis.\n",
      "AIM: To define the relation between T large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukaemia and pure red cell aplasia in Chinese patients. METHODS: Patients with T-LGL leukaemia were identified from a consecutive series of Chinese patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. The diagnosis of T-LGL leukaemia was based on typical morphological and immunophenotypical features, and confirmed by the detection of clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangement. The clinicopathological features, response to treatment, and long term follow up were also examined. RESULTS: Five patients were identified as having T-LGL leukaemia from a consecutive series of 33 Chinese patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. The median follow up time was 45 months. An obvious lymphocytosis was present in only two cases, although an increase in large granular lymphocytes in the peripheral blood was found in four. In one case, the LGL count was within the normal range. Epstein-Barr virus encoded early nuclear RNA was negative in all the cases. There was no evidence of rheumatoid arthritis, and none of the patients presented with recurrent infections. On follow up, pure red cell aplasia occurred at some stage of the disease in all the patients. This responded to treatment with cyclosporin A in two and with antithymocyte globulin in one. Two patients remained transfusion dependent. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to Western patients, Chinese patients with T-LGL leukaemia do not appear to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and recurrent infections, but pure red cell aplasia is a major cause of morbidity in this ethnic group.\n",
      "Initial interest in autologous blood stem cell transplants (ABSCT) in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was based on the postulate that there might be less malignant contamination than with bone marrow transplants. Although this remains presently uncertain, other advantages of ABSCT, such as a rapid haematopoietic recovery, were immediately recognized. In pilot studies, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were collected after standard induction and consolidation courses of chemotherapy. The actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse rates (RR) at 2-3 years ranged from 28 to 39% and 57 to 60%, respectively. Recently, PBSC collection after high-dose cytarabine, with or without G-CSF, has been associated with DFS ranging from 47 to 57%. Thus, the timing of stem cell collection seems to be crucial in AML and it should be performed following an efficient in vivo purging but before the haematopoietic reserve is exhausted. Clinical results with ABSCT are similar to those seen after autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT), although important issues such as potential contamination of stem cell collections and optimal timing of PBSC harvest remain to be clarified. Prospective randomized studies comparing ABMT and ABSCT are needed for definitive evaluation of the role of the source of stem cells in AML treatment.\n",
      "In a group of 74 adult ALL patients 25 had a transcortin level greater than or equal to 3 SD above the normal mean, 15 expressed an HLA-Cw3 antigen and 11 combined both characteristics. In this subgroup of 11 ALL patients, five had familial leukaemia, i.e. at least one relative with acute leukaemia or lymphoma. On the other hand, only three examples of familial leukaemia were found in a series of 59 ALL patients with one or none of these two characteristics (relative risk: 15.6; P less than 0.001).\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Infant leukaemia is likely initiated in utero. METHODS: We examined whether analgesic use during pregnancy was associated with risk by completing telephone interviews of the mothers of 441 infant leukaemia cases and 323 frequency-matched controls, using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: With the exception of a reduced risk for infant acute myeloid leukaemias with non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) use early in pregnancy (odds ratios=0.60; confidence intervals: 0.37-0.97), no statistically significant associations were observed for aspirin, non-aspirin NSAIDs, or acetaminophen use in early pregnancy or after knowledge of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Overall, analgesic use during pregnancy was not significantly associated with the risk of infant leukaemia.\n",
      "The fluorescence signal intensity of the DHFR gene was analysed in lymphocytes from 15 normal donors, in MTX-resistant HeLa cells (carrying DHFR gene amplification) and in bone marrow blasts from 16 patients with acute leukaemia (AL) by in situ hybridisation. Our aim was to verify if DHFR gene amplification may be responsible for increased enzyme activity in leukemic cells. The results obtained with a fluorescence in situ hybridisation method were quantified using the Scion image software program and compared with cytochemical and cytophotometric data relating to DHFR activity. In AL a heterogeneous hybridisation pattern was generally observed at the single cell level. However, leukemic lymphoblasts showed higher fluorescence signal intensity of the DHFR gene as compared with normal lymphocytes, and leukemic myeloblasts a much higher signal than lymphoblasts. HeLa cells showed the highest fluorescence signal intensity. In all samples enzyme activity behaved in parallel. These results indicate that the increased expression of DHFR in leukemic blasts is due to a gene amplification. The high levels in AML can explain the MTX natural resistance.\n",
      "Deoxyribonucleic acid microarrays allow researchers to measure mRNA levels of thousands of genes in a single experiment and could be useful for diagnostic purposes in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We assessed the feasibility of the AML profiler (Skyline™ Array) in genetic stratification of patients with de novo AML and compared the results with those obtained using the standard cytogenetic and molecular approach. Diagnostic bone marrow from 31 consecutive de novo AML cases was used to test MLL-PTD, FLT3-ITD and TKD, NPM1 and CEBPAdm mutations. Purified RNA was used to assess RUNX1-RUNX1T1, PML-RARα and CBFβ-MYH11 rearrangements. RNA remnants underwent gene expression profiling analysis using the AML profiler, which detects chromosomal aberrations: t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16), mutations (CEBPAdm, ABD-NPM1) and BAALC and EVI1 expression. Thirty cases were successfully analysed with both methods. Five cases had FLT3-ITD. In one case, a t(8;21) was correctly detected by both methods. Four cases had inv(16); in one, the RNA quality was unsatisfactory and it was not hybridized, and in the other three, the AML profiler detected the genetic lesion - this being a rare type I translocation in one case. Two cases with acute promyelocytic leukaemia were diagnosed by both methods. Results for NPM1 mutations were concordant in all but two cases (2/11, non-ABD mutations). Analysis of costs and turnaround times showed that the AML profiler was no more expensive than the conventional molecular approach. These results suggest that the AML profiler could be useful in multicentre trials to rapidly identify patients with AML with a good prognosis. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",
      "Although the majority of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are of advanced age, these patients have not been well represented in past clinical trials. This has resulted in a lack of evidence that has complicated treatment in this patient group. However, data from an increasing number of subgroup analyses of recent trials as well as from trials specifically designed for elderly patients with CLL have provided some insight into the feasibility of the available treatments, thus allowing development of the first evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacotherapeutic management of these patients. Physically fit patients without significant co-morbidity are likely to benefit from the standard treatment of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). However, whether treatment with purine analogues and/or CD20 antibodies is also beneficial in physically unfit patients suffering from additional health problems remains to be determined. Latest data suggest that the alkylating drug chlorambucil rather than fludarabine is a reasonable chemotherapeutic backbone for chemoimmunotherapy in these patients. Trials are now underway to investigate combinations of chlorambucil with rituximab or with novel CD20 antibodies (GA101 [afutuzumab], ofatumumab) in older CLL patients. In parallel, other regimens, including bendamustine or lenalidomide with or without the addition of rituximab, low-dose fludarabine and low-dose FCR, hold promise in elderly patients with previously untreated or relapsed CLL.\n",
      "We have used the MTT colorimetric assay to determine the sensitivity to ethacrynic acid of lymphocytes from normal donors and of peripheral blood cells from leukaemia patients. Whereas normal lymphocytes and cells from acute or chronic myeloid leukaemia showed similar sensitivities (median inhibitory dose, ID50 = 20-22 microM), lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients were much more sensitive (ID50 = 6 microM). This result was found irrespective of the assay duration.\n",
      "A previously untreated 31-yr old female with Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) received busulphan and melphalan at high dosage followed by an autograft of peripheral blood stem cells collected 4 weeks earlier. Though recovering haemopoiesis was at first mainly Ph-positive, Ph-negative haemopoiesis predominated at 12 months and has persisted until the most recent study (24 months post-autograft). Her haemopoietic cells now show no rearrangement of the bcr gene, unlike the cells collected at diagnosis. Autografting carried out soon after diagnosis could be valuable for obtaining cytogenetic remissions in other patients with CML.\n",
      "Three cases of contemporaneous acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and sarcoidosis are described. The possible pathogenic mechanisms concerning their concurrent appearance are discussed: if sarcoidosis impaired T-cell response, it could perhaps predispose the development of AML; alternatively, the development of sarcoidosis during AML may be due to a reaction linked to a diffuse release of tumour antigens with a subsequent formation of a non-caseating granulomata.\n",
      "The normal haematopoietic system harbours telomerase-competent cells with a capacity to upregulate the activity to notable levels in a telomere length-independent manner. Strong telomerase activity is found in progenitor stem cells and activated lymphocytes in vitro as well as in vivo, indicating that cells with high growth requirements can readily upregulate telomerase. Despite detection of telomerase activity, a gradual telomere erosion occurs in stem cells and lymphocytes, with significantly shortened telomeres at higher ages, a phenomenon that might be of importance for developing immunosenescence and exhausted haematopoiesis. In malignant haematopoietic disorders telomerase activity is a general finding with large differences in activity levels. The strongest telomerase expression has been shown in acute leukaemias and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, especially high grade cases. There are indications that the level of activity might parallel tumour progression and be of prognostic relevance, but studies of larger patient materials are needed. An association between the cell cycle and telomerase activity exists, especially for normal haematopoietic cells, and induction of a differentiation programme in immortalised cell lines downregulates telomerase activity. The expression of telomerase activity seems to be regulated at different levels, since for immature bone marrow cells the level of activity seemed to parallel better the phenotype than the proliferation state. The frequent expression of telomerase in leukaemias and lymphomas makes these disorders interesting targets for future anti-telomerase therapy.\n",
      "This overview of the epidemiology of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) summarizes the evolution of classification and coding systems and describes the intersection of pathogenesis and aetiology. The role of the putative precursor to CLL, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), is considered, and ideas for future investigations of the MBL-CLL relationship are outlined. We discuss the epidemiology of CLL, focusing on descriptive patterns and methodological considerations. Postulated risk factors are reviewed including the role of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, occupational and environmental chemical exposures, medical conditions and treatments, and lifestyle and genetic factors. We conclude by raising key questions that need to be addressed to advance our understanding of CLL aetiology. Recommendations for future epidemiological studies are given, including the standardization of reporting of CLL across cancer registries, the clarification of the natural history of MBL, and the circumvention of the methodological shortcomings of prior epidemiological investigations in relation to radiation, chemical exposures and infectious agents.\n",
      "Acquired chromosome aberrations are present in the marrow of most patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) at diagnosis. Cytogenetically, AML is a very heterogeneous disease with over 160 structural chromosome abnormalities observed recurrently to date. Molecular dissection of many reciprocal translocations and inversions has resulted in cloning of the genes involved in leukaemogenesis. Some recurrent aberrations and the resulting gene rearrangements, namely inv(16)/t(16;16) and CBFbeta- MYH11, t(8;21) and CBFA2-CBFA2T1, t(15;17) and PML-RARalpha, and rearrangements of band 11q23 and the MLL gene, are now used to help define distinct disease entities within AML in the new World Health Organization classification of haematological malignancies. Moreover, cytogenetic abnormalities, whether molecularly characterized or not, are among the most important, independent prognostic factors in AML, and are being used in the management of AML patients. This review presents current information on chromosome abnormalities in AML, and on associations between karyotype and clinical characteristics and outcome of AML patients.\n",
      "Primary myelosarcomas are rare manifestations of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) that precede bone marrow involvement. Out of 744 children observed during the AML-Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) studies 87 and 93, 34 children presented with extramedullar myelosarcomas and no blasts (n = 21; 2.8%), or a low blast count (n = 13; 1.7%) in the bone marrow. Owing to the initially mild and variable symptoms, in some children (n = 12) diagnostic procedures were delayed and treatment intensity was reduced. At 0.65 +/- 0.13, the cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly higher than in other AML patients (0.28 +/- 0.02). The 5-year event-free survival was 0.19 +/- 0.08 (compared with 0.48 +/- 0.02 in AML-BFM studies 87/93; P(log rank) < 0.03). Overall, 18 out of 34 patients died from disease (estimated 5 year survival 0.44 +/- 0.09 compared with 0.55 +/- 0.02 in the AML-BFM-studies 87/93; P(log rank) = 0.35, n.s.). An early diagnostic workup is needed in children with unusual skin lesions or tumours, considering myelosarcoma as a primary manifestation of AML. Intensive AML-specific chemotherapy is recommended soon after diagnosis.\n",
      "We performed splenectomy in four patients with severe neutropenia (less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l), recurrent infections, and splenomegaly associated with large granular lymphocyte leukaemia. Prior to splenectomy, elevated levels of neutrophil-reactive IgG were detected in sera of all three patients tested. In all patients, enlargement of the spleen was due to a characteristic lymphoid infiltration of red pulp cords. Splenectomy resulted in an increased neutrophil count greater than 0.5 X 10(9)/l in all patients; this response was sustained in two patients who benefited clinically by a dramatic reduction in frequency of infections. Poor clinical response was associated with elevated levels of antineutrophil antibody post-splenectomy. All four patients had an increase in number of circulating large granular lymphocytes post-splenectomy; one patient who had attained a sustained neutrophil response died of an accelerated lymphoproliferative disorder 19 months post-splenectomy. We conclude that splenectomy may be of value in correcting severe neutropenia and reducing infections in some patients with large granular lymphocyte leukaemia. However, splenectomy appeared to be of no value in treatment of the underlying lymphoproliferative disorder.\n",
      "PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the experiences of parents who care for children diagnosed with leukaemia. This paper is focused solely on reporting the interview findings from participating mothers regarding the challenges of caring for children with leukaemia in the context of the COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study took place in a Jordanian hospital where a descriptive qualitative design approach was applied on one oncology floor and an oncology clinic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with mothers of children aged 1-12 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Inductive thematic analysis approach was undertaken. Written consent was obtained from all participants. RESULTS: Fifteen interviews were conducted with fifteen mothers. Four major themes reflect the different challenges parents and children face during the COVID-19 pandemic: children refusing to wear masks, social isolation, family relationship and financial concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study present important data for health care professionals to help them understand the challenges faced by parents and children with leukaemia, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests activating emotional support teams in hospitals. These teams can actively help mothers express their concerns and worries which might otherwise foster self-blame, guilt and isolation.\n",
      "Using various risk factor scores, we aimed to identify a subset of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) for whom it was possible to assess the prognosis. We also aimed to develop a novel prognostic score system. This single centre study involved 102 patients of ≥60 years of age with non-promyelocytic AML. The adverse cytogenetic risk group appeared as the most significant independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS). Our prognostic scoring system was developed after analysing prognostic risk factors and was applied for patients with favourable and intermediate (I and II) cytogenetic risk groups: age <65 years of age, normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a comorbidity score obtained applying the haematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) < 3 = 0 points, in which age ≥65 years = 1 point and an elevated LDH score and HCT-CI ≥3 = 2 points. According to this prognostic model, patients without adverse cytogenetics were classified into three risk groups: favourable = 0-2 points, intermediate = 3-4 points and poor = > 4 points. The OS between these groups was highly significant (p < 0.001). The prognostic model developed in this study may refine the prognosis procedure of elderly AML patients without an adverse karyotype regarding OS, thereby guiding the treatment approach.\n",
      "BloodSpot is a gene-centric database of mRNA expression of haematopoietic cells. The web-based interface to the database includes three concomitant levels of visualization for a gene query; foremost is the expression across hematopoietic cell types, second is analysis of survival of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia patients based on gene expression, and lastly, the expression visualized in an interactive developmental tree. With the introduction of single cell data we have now also included an unbiased dimensionality reduction method to show gene expression over the continuum of haematopoiesis. The webserver includes a few select analysis functionalities, like Student t-test, identification of correlating genes and lookup of whole genetic signatures, with the aim of making generation and testing of hypotheses quick and intuitive. The visualizations have been updated to accommodate new datatypes and the database has been largely expanded with RNA-sequencing datasets, both purified in bulk and at single cell resolution, increasing the number of single samples more than 10 fold, while keeping simplicity in presentation.

      "A case of acute promyelocytic leukaemia is reported in which Sweet syndrome developed at the time of an improvement in white blood cell count due to transretinoic acid. Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) is a disorder characterized by acute onset of inflammatory skin nodules associated with systemic features which include malaise, fever and neutrophilia. Many triggers and associated disorders have been identified since the syndrome was described, the most important being the association with haematological diseases including leukaemias and other myeloproliferative disorders. We describe a case apparently provoked by drug therapy.\n",
      "Between 1988 and 1995, 341 children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were treated on the Medical Research Council Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Trial (MRC AML10). The 5-year overall survival was 57%, much improved on previous trials. However, there were 47 deaths (13. 8%), 11 of which were associated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The treatment-related mortality was significant at 13.8%, but decreased in the latter half of the trial from 17.8% in 1998-91 to 9. 6% in 1992-95 (P = 0.03%). The main causes of death were infection (65.9%), haemorrhage (19.1%) and cardiac failure (19.1%). Fungal infection was a significant problem, causing 23% of all infective deaths. Haemorrhage occurred early in treatment, in children with initial white cell counts >100 x 109/l (P = 0.001), and was more common in those with M4 and M5 morphology. Cardiac failure only occurred from the third course of chemotherapy onwards, with 78% (7/9) in conjunction with sepsis as a terminal event. Some deaths could be prevented by identifying those most at risk, and with prompt recognition and aggressive management of complications of treatment. Future options include the prophylactic use of antifungal agents, and the use of cardioprotectants or alternatives to conventional anthracyclines to decrease cardiac toxicity.\n",
      "An epidemiological study was undertaken to determine whether the animal carcinogen, epichlorohydrin (ECH), produces cancer in man. A total of 863 workers with probable exposure to ECH at two chemical plants during 1948-65 were followed up for deaths up to 1983. Twenty years or more after first exposure the all cancer SMR was 112.2 (22 deaths) and the SMR for leukaemia was 500.0 (three deaths), which is statistically significant. All cancer, leukaemia, and most other causes of death were related to estimated levels of exposure to ECH, except violence. The most consistent (both plants) relation was between exposure level and heart disease. Overall, the heart disease SMR 20 years or more after first exposure was 39.2 (five deaths) for low exposure and 105.4 (17 deaths) for high exposure. Limited evidence of a cardiovascular disease relation to ECH production in one other epidemiological study is supported by this study. Allyl chloride used in the production of ECH may play a part. The relation of heart disease and exposure does not appear to be an artifact, although the fact that many other causes of death were also related to exposure argues against a causal relation.\n",
      "This study presents the clinical and imaging findings in seven patients with parameningeal leukaemic masses: four adults with granulocytic sarcoma and three children with soft tissue masses from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were helpful in detecting these masses and in showing their extent. Magnetic resonance was particularly valuable in demonstrating abnormal bone marrow in the adult patients with granulocytic sarcoma. Computed tomography was valuable in demonstrating leukaemic relapse in the children when examination of CSF or bone marrow showed no evidence of leukaemia.\n",
      "Monosomy or deletion of chromosome 7 is a frequent finding in both de novo and secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Based on analysis of deletions of chromosome 7 in such patients, it has been suggested that there is a critical region of the chromosome lying within bands q21-q31. We have examined bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 10 patients with MDS, AML and biphenotypic acute leukaemia who had monosomy for or rearrangement of chromosome 7, seeking evidence of non-random allele loss that might suggest the presence of imprinted genes on the chromosome. Bone marrow cells from one patient with the infant monosomy 7 syndrome had loss of maternal alleles as did two patients with biphenotypic leukaemia. Five out of five patients with MDS and both patients with de novo AML had loss of paternal alleles. One of the latter patients had a del(7) (q31q36) rather than monosomy 7. These findings suggest that imprinting of a gene(s) on chromosome 7, within the bands q31-q36, may be of importance in MDS and AML. Despite the reported increased incidence of AML amongst relatives of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) the gene for which lies in chromosome region 7q31, none of the patients nor parents studied here appeared to be carriers of the most common gene mutation seen in patients with CF, the delta F508.\n",
      "Diagnostic features (cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and serum biochemistry) were examined in 51 cases of acute monocytic leukaemia (AMoL). Peroxidase, Sudan black B and alpha naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) cytochemical reactions were unrelated to morphological (FAB groups M5a and M5b) or immunological subtype. ANAE cytochemistry, however, indicated that AMoL cases could be subdivided into those with typical (M-type) reactions and those with insignificant staining or monocytic ANAE isoenzymes (defined by IEF). All cases were phenotypically CD13/CD33 positive and, with one exception, had greater than 30% HLA-DR positive cells. Membrane CD14 expression was insignificant or variable in 33% of M5a cases in contrast to 23/24 M5b cases which showed high proportions of CD14-staining cells with at least two monoclonal antibodies. Serum lysozyme, LDH and beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2m) were increased in 88%, 68% and 81% of cases respectively but, with the exception of statistically higher lysozyme levels in CD14+ cases, were unrelated to the morphological, cytochemical or immunological diagnostic subgroups. Clinical and diagnostic features were also examined as possible prognostic indicators. The morphological, cytochemical and immunological subgroups of AMoL were not found to be of prognostic relevance but age (P = 0.004), renal failure (P = 0.005) and serum beta 2m levels (P = 0.002) were related to patient survival. Moreover, renal failure and serum beta 2m remained significant (P = 0.012 respectively) when age was taken into account and were shown to be independent prognostic variables.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Mobile phone use is now ubiquitous, and scientific reviews have recommended research into its relation to leukaemia risk, but no large studies have been conducted. METHODS: In a case-control study in South East England to investigate the relation of acute and non-lymphocytic leukaemia risk to mobile phone use, 806 cases with leukaemia incident 2003-2009 at ages 18-59 years (50% of those identified as eligible) and 585 non-blood relatives as controls (provided by 392 cases) were interviewed about mobile phone use and other potentially aetiological variables. RESULTS: No association was found between regular mobile phone use and risk of leukaemia (odds ratio (OR)=1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.76, 1.46). Analyses of risk in relation to years since first use, lifetime years of use, cumulative number of calls and cumulative hours of use produced no significantly raised risks, and there was no evidence of any trends. A non-significantly raised risk was found in people who first used a phone 15 or more years ago (OR=1.87, 95% CI=0.96, 3.63). Separate analyses of analogue and digital phone use and leukaemia subtype produced similar results to those overall. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that use of mobile phones does not increase leukaemia risk, although the possibility of an effect after long-term use, while biologically unlikely, remains open.\n",
      "Although p53 is found mutated in almost 50% of all cancers, p53 mutations in leukaemia are relatively rare. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells employ other strategies to inactivate their wild type p53 (WTp53), like the overexpression of the p53 negative regulators Mdm2 and Mdm4. As such, AMLs are excellent candidates for therapeutics involving the reactivation of their WTp53 to restrict and destroy cancer cells, and the Mdm2 antagonist nutlin-3 is one such promising agent. Using AML cell lines with WTp53, we identified stable and high levels of p53 in the OCI/AML-2 cell lines. We demonstrate that this nutlin-3 sensitive cell line overexpressed Mdm4 to sequester, stabilise and inhibit p53 in the cytoplasm. We also show that elevated Mdm4 competed with Mdm2-p53 interaction and therefore extended p53 half-life while preventing p53 transcriptional activity. Our results provide biochemical evidence on the dynamics of the p53-Mdm2-Mdm4 interactions in affecting p53 levels and activity, and unlike previously reported findings derived from genetically manipulated systems, AML cells with naturally high levels of Mdm4 remain sensitive to nutlin treatment. KEY POINTS: Endogenously high levels of Mdm4 inhibit and sequester p53 in AML. High levels of Mdm4 do not block function of Mdm2 inhibitors in AML.\n",
      "E-cadherin (epithelial cadherin) belongs to the calcium-dependent adhesion molecule superfamily and is implicated in the interactions of haematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow stromal cells. Adhesion capacity to bone marrow stroma was impaired for leukaemia cells, suggesting that a breakdown of adhesive mechanisms governed by an adhesion molecule may exist in leukaemic microenvironment. We previously found that E-cadherin was low expressed in primary acute leukaemia cells compared with normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. In this study, we investigate the functional importance of low E-cadherin expression in leukaemia cell behaviours and investigate its effects in the abnormal interaction of leukaemic cells with stromal cells. After expression of E-cadherin was restored by a demethylating agent in leukaemia cells, E-cadherin-specific adhesion was enhanced. Additionally, siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated silencing of E-cadherin in Raji cells resulted in a reduction of cell homophilic adhesion and enhancement of cell proliferation and colony formation. These results suggest that low expression of E-cadherin contributes to the vigorous growth and transforming ability of leukaemic cells.\n",
      "T-cell targeting immunotherapy is now considered as a possible strategy in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Clinical importance of antileukaemic T-cell reactivity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is well established and the early experience from IL-2 therapy suggests that even autologous T-cells can mediate antileukaemic reactivity. The clinical experience also indicates that immunotherapy should begin when the leukaemia cell burden is minimal, and the detection of an operative cellular immune system, even in patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia, further suggests that it is possible to begin T-cell targeting therapy early after chemotherapy while patients are still cytopenic. However, adult patients in particular have a T-cell defect after chemotherapy that may last for several months. For this reason immunotherapy should probably be continued or repeated until a maximal effect is achieved when the patients no longer have a T-cell defect. This treatment approach may also be considered in combination with autologous SCT. T-cell targeting regimens should include, if possible, several therapeutic components. Firstly, native AML blasts can function as accessory cells during T-cell activation and in vivo therapy with T-cell growth factors (e.g., IL-2, IL-15) may then enhance antileukaemic reactivity or non-specific cytotoxicity against the AML cells; and secondly, a further enhancement of AML-specific reactivity may be achieved by vaccination with AML-specific peptides, immunisation with AML-blasts expressing a dendritic cell phenotype, or exposure to normal antigen-presenting cells (APC) pulsed with or expressing AML-specific peptide sequences.\n",
      "Like formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues, archived bone marrow aspirate slides are an abundant and untapped resource of biospecimens that could enable retrospective molecular studies of disease. Historically, RNA obtained from slides is limited in utility because of their low quality and highly fragmented nature. MicroRNAs are small (≈ 22 nt) non-coding RNA that regulate gene expression, and are speculated to preserve well in FFPE tissue. Here we investigate the use of archived bone marrow aspirate slides for miRNA expression analysis in paediatric leukaemia. After determining the optimal method of miRNA extraction, we used TaqMan qRT-PCR to identify reference miRNA for normalisation of other miRNA species. We found hsa-miR-16 and hsa-miR-26b to be the most stably expressed between lymphoblastoid cell lines, primary bone marrow aspirates and archived samples. We found the average fold change in expression of hsa-miR-26b and two miRNA reportedly dysregulated in leukaemia (hsa-miR-128a, hsa-miR-223) was <0.5 between matching archived slide and bone marrow aspirates. Differential expression of hsa-miR-128a and hsa-miR-223 was observed between leukaemic and non-leukaemic bone marrow from archived slides or flash frozen bone marrow. The demonstration that archived bone marrow aspirate slides can be utilized for miRNA expression studies offers tremendous potential for future investigations into the role miRNA play in the development and long term outcome of hematologic, as well as non-hematologic, diseases.\n",
      "We prospectively investigated minimal residual disease (MRD) in 51 children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated according to the Fralle 93 protocol. PCR follow-up was performed in children in morphological and cytogenetic complete remission, provided an immunoglobulin (IgH) gene rearrangement could be detected using FR 3/J(H) amplimers. MRD was studied according to our previously described methodology, with a few modifications including the use of a consensus J(H) probe to control for PCR efficiency variations. Out of the initial 51 patients, 34 were assessable for MRD at the end of induction at the time of analysis. MRD levels were as follows: > 1/10(3) in 26%, 1/10(3) to 1/10(4) in 50% and < 1/10(4) or not detectable in 24%. With a median follow-up of 20 months there were five relapses, all of which occurred in the group of patients with MRD > 1/10(3). To date, none of the patients with MRD < or = 1/10(3) (good molecular responder) has relapsed. Classification according to molecular response at the end of induction did not correlate with the conventional risks groups: there were no statistically significant differences between good and bad molecular responders. Of particular interest is the absence of correlation between WBC at diagnosis and MRD level at the end of induction. We conclude that classification of patients into good and bad molecular responders using PCR seems to be a better prognostic indicator than conventional risk factors in childhood B-lineage ALL. Patients with MRD level > 1/10(3) have a particularly poor outcome and should always be considered for alternative therapeutic strategies in the future, whereas in good molecular responders belonging to poor or intermediate risk categories, treatment de-escalation might be contemplated.\n",
      "Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) usually occurs in its natural species, the domestic cat. FeLV is also important to human individuals as a comparative model, as it may cause a variety of diseases, some malignant and some benign, such as immunosuppression, which bears a resemblance to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in man. FeLV is transmitted among cats by contagion. The main sources of infection are persistently infected carrier cats which continuously excrete virus. Dissemination of FeLV among cats may be prevented by identifying infected carrier cats and removing them from contact with non-infected cats. Removal programmes using indirect immunofluorescence antibody tests were applied successfully in The Netherlands. The proportion of FeLV-positive cats decreased from 9% in 1974 to approximately 3% in 1985 during such a programme. The results of a removal programme carried out in a catbreeders' society were even better: the incidence of cats positive for FeLV decreased from 11% in 1974 to less than 2% within 4 years. None of the cats tested in this society has been found to be positive for FeLV since 1984. Besides removal programmes, other methods of control, such as pre-exposure treatment, were developed to prevent the spread of FeLV. We attempted to protect kittens against oronasal infection with FeLV by treatment with virus-neutralizing (VN) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed against an epitope on the viral glycoprotein gp70. However, no protection was achieved. It is unlikely that the amount of VN antibodies, the mode and route of their application or the infectious dose of FeLV used can account for this failure. Other possible explanations for the lack of protective effect are that (i) the restricted epitope specificity of the MoAb preparation used may have led to selection of neutralization-resistant virus mutants, or (ii) other mechanisms than virus neutralization (complement-mediated lysis, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity), that may be involved in protection, function less efficiently with MoAb. However, in the light of our finding that an early anti-idiotypic response is observed in all cats following administration of the MoAb preparation, the rapid clearance of anti-FeLV MoAb from the circulation is a more likely explanation. Efforts were further made to develop a vaccine for controlling FeLV infection. The immunostimulating complex vaccine (FeLV-ISCOM vaccine), a subunit vaccine in which FeLV gp70 is presented in a particular manner, looks promising. The protective effect of FeLV-ISCOM vaccine was studied by vaccinating six 8-week-old SPF cats with ISCOM, followed by oronasal challenge with FeLV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n",
      "We have determined the feasibility of using the MTT colorimetric assay for measuring the sensitivity of fresh leukaemia cells to cytotoxic agents. A linear relationship was seen between the number of leukaemic cells plated and the resulting absorbance in the MTT assay at day 4. For 2 X 10(5) cells/well from CLL peripheral lymphocytes, the mean absorbance (measured at 540 nm) was 0.41. Similar curves were obtained with the assay carried out between days 3 and 7. ID50 values for CLL lymphocytes exposed to adriamycin (ADM) were in the range of 0.02-0.29 micrograms/ml, a similar range to that given by the DiSC dye exclusion assay. Sensitization of leukaemia cells to ADM by verapamil or cyclosporin A could be demonstrated in some patients but not in others. The lymphocytes from one patient with prolymphocytic leukaemia were abnormally resistant to ionizing radiation. These cells also showed resistance to melphalan and adriamycin but not to vincristine. The MTT assay appears to offer an attractive option for in vitro chemosensitivity testing in leukaemia, determination of cross-resistance profiles and studies of resistance modifiers.\n",
      "Immunotherapy for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and other haematological malignancies may consist of passive antibody, active immunization or adoptive T-cell transfer. This chapter will focus on T-lymphocyte immunotherapy; an approach supported by earlier observations that the beneficial effects of allogeneic stem cell transplantation depend, in part, on the graft-versus-leukaemia effects mediated by these cells. One promising strategy consists of the genetic manipulation of effector T lymphocytes to express tumour-specific T-cell receptors or chimeric antigen receptors directed against surface antigens on the B-CLL cells. This methodology is now being integrated with the concept that tumour recurrence may be due to the persistence of a reservoir of more primitive and chemoresistant tumour cells, dubbed 'cancer stem cells', with self-renewal capacity. Identification and characterization of these cancer stem cells in B-CLL is crucial for the development of new anti-tumour agents, and for the identification of target antigens for cellular immunotherapy. This chapter will describe how immunotherapy may be directed to a more primitive side population of B-CLL cells.\n",
      "Great strides have been made in the chemotherapy of adult acute myeloid leukaemia in the last two decades. This paper describes our experience in the treatment of adult acute myeloid leukaemia from 1980-88. About two thirds of patients achieve remission with a standard chemotherapy protocol. Early disease relapse and measures to prevent it are major problems. The majority of patients with adult myeloid leukaemia, presently, are not cured with chemotherapy alone.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Depletion of guanine and deoxyguanine nucleotides by inhibition of inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH, EC 1.1.1.205) or introduction of 6-thioguanine nucleotide antimetabolites are two principles of retarding cell proliferation by interference with the cellular purine nucleotide pool. IMPDH activity may be a promising pharmacodynamic biomarker during immunosuppressive and anticancer pharmacotherapy. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and 6-thioguanosine (tGuO) on IMPDH basal activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied the IMPDH basal activity (i.e. the enzyme activity following inhibitor exposure, but measured in absence of the inhibitor) in response to increasing concentrations of the IMPDH inhibitor MPA and the antimetabolite tGuO in MOLT-4 human leukaemia cells. In parallel, IMPDH gene expression and cellular purine nucleotide concentrations were examined. RESULTS: A biphasic concentration-dependent influence of MPA on the IMPDH basal activity was observed. At concentrations < or =IC50, MPA increased the IMPDH basal activity. The increase was associated with elevated expression of IMPDH2. Despite increased expression, the basal enzyme activity decreased following exposure to high MPA concentrations. The IMPDH2 expression increased modestly in response to tGuO exposure. However, the IMPDH basal activity decreased when the cells were exposed to a proliferation-blocking tGuO concentration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that IMPDH basal activity is influenced by MPA and tGuO, and suggest that reduced IMPDH basal activity is related to the proliferation-blocking effects of these agents.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Early T-cell precursor (ETP) leukaemias have been recently recognized as a form of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) with a poor prognosis. The purpose of this review is to outline the most recent advances in the biology, genetics and prognostic significance of this aggressive disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Detailed immunophenotypic analyses have defined ETP T-ALLs as a distinct group of T-ALL with a poor prognosis. Transcriptionally, ETP T-ALLs and early immature T-ALLs, a broader group of tumours characterized by very early arrest in T-cell differentiation, are most related to haematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors. Consistently, these leukaemias show lower frequencies of prototypical T-ALL lesions such as CDKN2A/B deletions and activating mutations in NOTCH1 and show a higher prevalence of mutations typically associated with the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs). SUMMARY: ETP and early immature T-ALLs are characterized by a very early differentiation arrest and show unique genetic and transcriptional features that overlap both with T-ALL and with AML. Given the unique biology and poor prognosis associated with the ETP T-ALL group, there is an urgent need of new tailored therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disease.\n",
      "The transduction of Notch signal plays an intricate role in cell differentiation and pathogenesis of haematological malignancies as well as in certain congenital conditions. The functionality of Notch signalling was tested using HES1 gene activation. SEL1 gene product has been postulated to be a negative regulator of Notch signalling. We investigated the relationship between Notch signalling and the expression of SEL1L gene in a number of leukaemia and lymphoma cells in culture. The cell lines could be separated into two groups. Group 1 contained lymphoma cell lines in which Notch signalling was intact; of these 4 cell lines were SEL1L+/HES1- and 3 SEL1L-/HES1-. Notch signalling was not subverted by EBNA2 expression in these lymphoma cells. In Group 2 cell lines Notch signalling was constitutively active but 6 out of 7 cell lines expressed SEL1L at high levels. In summary, a majority of cell lines of both groups express SEL1L and no inverse relationship is evident between SEL1L expression and the status of Notch signalling. The present investigation therefore suggests that SEL1L may not exert a negative regulatory influence on Notch signalling. No genomic alterations affecting SEL1L were detected either in the lymphoma or T-ALL cell lines tested. Taken together the present findings do not support the postulated negative regulatory role for SEL1L in Notch signalling.\n",
      "The major adverse consequences of radiation exposure, including the initiation of leukaemia and other malignancies, are generally attributed to effects in the cell nucleus at the time of irradiation. However, genomic damage as a longer term consequence of radiation exposure has more recently been demonstrated due to untargeted radiation effects including delayed chromosomal instability and bystander effects. These processes, mainly studied in vitro, are characterized by un-irradiated cells demonstrating effects as though they themselves had been irradiated and have been associated with altered oxidative processes. To investigate the potential for these untargeted effects of radiation to produce delayed damaging events in vivo, we studied a well-characterized model of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia in CBA/Ca mice. Haemopoietic tissues of irradiated CBA/Ca mice exhibit enhanced levels of p53 stabilization, increased levels of p21(waf1), and increased amounts of apoptosis, as expected, in the first few hours post-irradiation, but also at much later times: weeks and months after the initial exposure. Because these responses are seen in cells that were not themselves directly irradiated but are the descendants of irradiated cells, the data are consistent with an initial radiation exposure leading to persistently increased levels of ongoing DNA damage, analogous to radiation-induced chromosomal instability. To investigate the potential source of ongoing oxidative processes, we show increased levels of 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker of damaging nitrogen/oxygen species in macrophages. Not all animals show increased oxidative activity or p53 responses as long-term consequences of irradiation, but increased levels of p53, p21, and apoptosis are directly correlated with increased 3-nitrotyrosine in individual mice post-irradiation. The data implicate persistent activation of inflammatory-type responses in irradiated tissues as a contributory bystander mechanism for causing delayed DNA damage.\n",
      "We describe three cases of acute myeloid leukaemia revealed by diabetes insipidus. The patients were 42, 38 and 39 yr old and they had marked hyperleukocytosis, circulating immature granular cells and a normal or elevated platelet count. The leukaemia was type AML-M2 according to the FAB classification. Cytogenetic studies showed inversion of chromosome 3 (q21;q26) in 2 cases and a translocation (3;3)(q21;q29?) in the remaining case, both associated with monosomy 7. All the cerebral CT scans were normal. Complete remission was never achieved, and all three patients survived less than 14 months. Desmopressin therapy was active but treatment could not be reduced. The association of dysmegakaryopoiesis with a chromosome 3 abnormality and diabetes insipidus is probably not fortuitous and could represent a new entity.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the observed excess of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma near the Sellafield nuclear plant is associated with established risk factors or with factors related to the plant. DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTING: West Cumbria health district. SUBJECTS: 52 Cases of leukaemia, 22 of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 23 of Hodgkin disease occurring in people born in the area and diagnosed there in 1950-85 under the age of 25 and 1001 controls matched for sex and date of birth taken from the same birth registers as the cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antenatal abdominal x ray examinations, viral infections, habit factors, proximity to and employment characteristics of parents at Sellafield. RESULTS: Ascertainment of cases through multiple sources was as complete as possible, and the diagnosis was established for nearly all cases from hospital records and by independent pathological review when suitable material (60% (58) of cases) was available. Identification and tracing of the parents of cases and controls enabled questionnaires to be forwarded to 730 (66%), and 467 (64%) of the questionnaires were returned completed. Obstetric records were located for 481 (44%) of the relevant births, more frequently in recent years. Linkage of study subjects to the Sellafield workforce file enabled dates of employment and records on external doses of whole body ionising radiation to be obtained. Concordance of information from duplicate sources (when available) was reasonably high with no indications of bias. CONCLUSION: Overall the collected data were sufficiently reliable for detailed analysis and careful interpretation.\n",
      "Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors have changed the natural history of chronic myeloid leukaemia in such a way that patients with adequate access to these agents, who are properly managed, and who respond well to this treatment can expect a near-normal life expectancy. Achieving this goal requires an adequate understanding of the patient treatment goals, careful monitoring for the achievement of optimal response hallmarks, implementation of proper interventions according to the attainment of such endpoints, adequate recognition and management of adverse events, and acknowledgment of the relevance of comorbidities. Treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, once considered lifelong, has become terminable for at least some patients, and promising new agents are emerging for those whose disease does not respond to any of the multiple therapeutic options currently available. If these advances reach all patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, cure might eventually become a reality in most instances.\n",
      "Donor-derived leukaemia is exceptional after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A woman with chronic myeloid leukaemia received an allogeneic BMT from a human leucocyte antigen-identical brother. The donor, a 50-year-old non-smoker, died of squamous cell bronchogenic carcinoma 1 year later. At 4 years post BMT, the patient became BCR/ABL positive and relapsed with acute myeloid leukaemia, which was shown to be donor-derived cytogenetically and molecularly. Retrospective analysis showed that the donor-leukaemic clone had started to evolve as early as 6 months post BMT. Sequencing of p53 ruled out Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Predisposition to malignancy might be an underlying mechanism of donor-cell leukaemia.\n",
      "We reviewed eight cases that were diagnosed before 1995 with B-prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-PLL) harbouring t(11;14)(q13;q32) and/or cyclin D1 staining. Thirteen B-PLL patients without t(11;14) were selected as controls. Peripheral blood, bone marrow and histological sections were re-examined without cytogenetic information. Final diagnosis was made using morphology, cytogenetics, immunophenotype and immunohistochemistry. Clinical characteristics were similar for both groups except for younger age, male predominance and extranodal involvement in cases with t(11;14). CD5 was more frequently positive in the t(11;14)+ group (80%) than in the t(11;14)- group (31%). Surface membrane immunoglobulin was strongly expressed by all t(11;14)+ cases, but only 45% of t(11;14)- cases. Histopathological and cytological review of cases with t(11;14) showed an infiltrate with a mixture of cells, some resembling prolymphocytes and others with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) morphology. Blood films of cases with t(11;14) showed features suggestive of B-PLL in three, and in others, a mixture of cells resembling MCL and nucleolated ones; none corresponded to the blastoid form of MCL. We suggest that 'B-PLL' with t(11;14) may represent a splenomegalic form of MCL evolving with leukaemia. These cases illustrate the importance of tissue diagnosis with cyclin D1 staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in B-cell leukaemia with prolymphocytic features.\n",
      "P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression, which is associated with the multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype, has been reported to be a useful predictor of treatment outcome in acute leukaemia. We have examined the expression of Pgp on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells in 54 newly diagnosed patients, using a novel streptavidin-biotin complex (ABC) technique. 55% of patients at diagnosis were positive for Pgp with JSB-1, a monoclonal antibody that binds to an internal epitope of Pgp. All patients received intensive induction chemotherapy. Post-remission treatment consisted of further chemotherapy +/- bone marrow transplantation. Complete remission (CR) rates were significantly lower in the Pgp positive group than in the Pgp negative group (60% v 92%; P = 0.02). The overall survival for Pgp-positive patients was significantly shorter (329 v 534d, P = 0.004), disease-free survival was also reduced but the difference was not statistically significant (median 277 v 522d, P = 0.16). In this study CD34 expression was not predictive of response to chemotherapy nor was it associated with Pgp expression. Our results confirm the prognostic value of Pgp expression in AML at diagnosis and we suggest that Pgp could be a useful therapeutic target for reversing multi-drug resistance. Furthermore, our simple and sensitive method of detecting Pgp should enable widespread testing to be performed.\n",
      "Generalizations of the two-mutation carcinogenesis model of Moolgavkar, Venzon and Knudson (MVK) are fitted to England and Wales lymphocytic leukaemia incidence data covering the period 1971-1988. Both acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) can be fitted by a model with two mutations. These two-mutation models are such that the first (but not the second) mutation rate and the susceptible stem cell population vary rapidly with age. CLL is also adequately fitted by a model with three mutations, and the mutation rates and the variation in the stem cell population numbers implied by the three-mutation model are more plausible than those of the two-mutation model. For CLL there are no significant differences between the sexes in either of the optimal models fitted, but this is not the case for ALL. Thus the original MVK model adequately describes population rates of lymphocytic leukaemia in England and Wales.\n",
      "The cytochemical features of blast cells were studied in 45 patients with blastic phase of chronic granulocytic leukaemia. Various degrees of Sudan black B positivity was characteristic of myeloblastic transformation (23 patients), while in the medullary blast cells of nine patients with myelomonocytic transformation the alpha-naphthyl-acetate esterase showed intensive activity. In two cases the demonstrability of beta-thromboglobulin and factor VIII-related antigen in blast cells showing otherwise PAS, acid phosphatase and alpha-naphthyl-acetate esterase activity referred to megakaryocytic transformation. In six patients with lymphoid blast crisis proliferation of the Sudan negative blast cells with different granular PAS, acid phosphatase and/or beta-glucuronidase positivity was demonstrated. In five cases the cytochemical findings of leukaemic cells indicated biphenotypic and mixed transformation, respectively.\n",
      "For several decades, few substantial therapeutic advances have been made for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. However, since 2017 unprecedented growth has been seen in the number of drugs available for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia, with several new drugs receiving regulatory approval. In addition to advancing our therapeutic armamentarium, an increased understanding of the biology and genomic architecture of acute myeloid leukaemia has led to refined risk assessment of this disease, with consensus risk stratification guidelines now incorporating a growing number of recurrent molecular aberrations that aid in the selection of risk-adapted management strategies. Despite this promising recent progress, the outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia remain unsatisfactory, with more than half of patients ultimately dying from their disease. Enrolment of patients into clinical trials that evaluate novel drugs and rational combination therapies is imperative to continuing this progress and further improving the outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "Between May 1988 and March 1995, 359 children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were treated in the MRC AML 10 trial. Three risk groups were identified based on cytogenetics and response to treatment. One hundred and twenty-five children relapsed--103 in the bone marrow only, 12 in the bone marrow combined with other sites, and six had isolated extramedullary relapses (site was not known in four cases). Eighty-seven children received further combination chemotherapy, one all-trans retinoic acid for acute promyelocytic leukaemia, and one a matched unrelated donor allograft in relapse, and 61 achieved a second remission. One patient with no details on reinduction therapy also achieved second remission. Treatment in second remission varied--44 children received a BMT (22 autografts, 12 matched unrelated donor allografts, 10 family donor allografts), and 17 were treated with chemotherapy alone. The overall survival rate for all children (treated and untreated) was 24% at 3 years, with a disease-free survival of 44% for those achieving a second remission. Length of first remission was the most important factor affecting response rates--children with a first remission of less than 1 year fared poorly (second remission rate 36%, 3 year survival 11%), whereas those with longer first remissions had a higher response rate (second remission rate 75%, 3 year survival 49%, P < 0.0001).\n",
      "T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is an aggressive leukaemia accounting for over 30% of all mature T-cell malignancies. We describe the clinical manifestations and histology of cutaneous involvement in a series of 92 patients with T-PLL. Of the 92 patients, 26 (28%) had cutaneous involvement, and in 23 this was present at the time of the diagnosis of the leukaemia. Skin manifestations included a diffuse infiltrated erythema, infiltration localized to the face and ears, nodules and erythroderma. Histology showed a perivascular and periappendageal dermal infiltrate of lymphoid cells with the morphology of prolymphocytes. An early skin biopsy in these patients should help to reveal the underlying diagnosis.\n",
      "High rates of leukaemia in children and young people have been associated with features of community isolation and population growth. Incidence data collected by two specialist registries were used to compare incidence rates at ward level with relevant ward characteristics derived from routine census and Ordnance Survey data for England and Wales. An excess risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was found for wards which are farthest from large urban centres. The excess was greatest for wards of higher socioeconomic status and for children aged 1-7 years (the childhood peak), for which a two-fold excess was seen. These findings in general support the hypothesis that childhood leukaemia has an infectious aetiology.\n",
      "The natural history of chronic myelogenous leukaemia has changed in recent years, partly as a result of earlier diagnosis but mostly as a consequence of the availability of effective therapies that have the potential to eradicate the Philadelphia-positive clone. The prognostic models designed in the pre-interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) era based on clinical characteristics of the disease are still useful in identifying different risk groups after treatment with IFN-alpha, but achieving a cytogenetic response with IFN-alpha is now the most important prognostic factor for survival. The significance of other molecular and biological variables remains to be determined.\n",
      "With 5-year event-free survival of 80% now commonplace for paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and 50% for paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), recent efforts have focused on optimum risk-directed treatment. Because cranial irradiation can cause many acute and late complications (eg, second cancers, neurocognitive deficits, endocrine disorders, and growth impairment), it has been largely replaced by intensive intrathecal treatment and systemic chemotherapy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (12-18 Gy) is given to 2-20% of patients with ALL who have an increased risk of CNS relapse (such as T-cell immunophenotype, overt CNS disease, high-risk cytogenetic features, or poor response to remission induction treatment), and for the estimated 2% of patients with AML who have overt CNS disease at diagnosis. Although this strategy restricts CNS relapse to 3-8% of patients, several challenges remain. Methods need to eliminate relapse without the use of cranial irradiation in very high-risk patients. Effective retrieval treatment is needed for patients with relapsed or refractory CNS leukaemia, and intrathecal treatment with improved efficacy and reduced side-effects remains a long-term objective. Perhaps the most formidable challenge is to treat children with CNS relapse after a short initial remission or cranial irradiation.\n",
      "We have tested folinic acid (FA) for ability to increase peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) after chemotherapeutic aplasia in acute leukaemia. Five adult patients (four AML, one ALL) entered the study, each patient underwent two series of three leukapheresis, the first following induction chemotherapy and the second following the first course of consolidation. The first leukapheresis of each series was done when the white blood cell count reached 10(9)/l with subsequent leukapheresis every other day. Folinic acid (Lederle Laboratories, France) was administered at a dose of 50 mg (i.v.) per day, 15 days from initiation of chemotherapy and continuing through the third leukapheresis of the series (days 25-30). PBSC were collected on a Haemonetics V50 cell separator. In these five cases we observed an increased yield of both colony-forming units, granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) expressed per ml of cytapheresis product: CFU-GM x 18, BFU-E x 3 and if expressed per 10(4)/kg of body weight: CFU-GM x 30, BFU-E x 3 (CFU-GM P less than 0.05, BFU-E less than 0.01). Long-term blood culture (LTSC) from FA stimulated leukapheresis, in an attempt to quantitate the most primitive stem cells, demonstrated that this expansion of the PBSC was sustained in time. We found by means of LTSC that FA did not stimulate CFU-L from patients with AML (two cases tested). Finally two AML patients were grafted with FA-PBSC after Cytotoxan and total body irradiation (TBI). Haematopoietic reconstitution was rapid complete and sustained in time in both patients. This indication for folinic acid should be further studied with or as an alternative to haematopoietic growth factors.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin (DNR), overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and treatment response in acute leukaemia. Twenty-seven patients with acute leukaemia received DNR as part of induction therapy. The plasma and cellular levels of DNR and its metabolite daunorubicinol (DOL) were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences between patients who went into complete remission (12/23) compared with those who did not respond for the following pharmacokinetic parameters: DNR and DOL plasma AUC (area under the curve) and DNR plasma half-life and clearance. There was a significant difference in the cellular DNR and DOL AUC between responders and non-responders (P < 0.02). Seven patients were Pgp positive and 18 Pgp negative. There was no correlation between patient response and the presence of Pgp (P > 0.1), nor was there any correlation between the cellular concentration of DNR or DOL and Pgp (P > 0.3). To our knowledge this is the first report examining the relationship between DNR pharmacokinetics, patient response and Pgp expression. Our data indicated that acute leukaemia patients responding to chemotherapy had higher cellular DNR and DOL than non-responders; also, overexpression of Pgp appeared not to be the sole explanation for the lower cellular DNR levels as expected from in vitro studies.\n",
      "Personality was assessed by means of the Personality Research Form (PRF) in 35 patients with acute leukaemia, Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia, or Severe Aplastic Anemia at hospital admission for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The sample was split into two groups of patients with high or low scores, respectively, in four PRF second order factors and survival curves of these groups were compared by means of Kaplan-Meier Analyses. Longest observation time lasted for more than two years. Patients scoring high in 'Strive for recognition and help' had a higher survival probability after about one year post BMT. It is suggested that compliance behaviour is the pathway mediating between personality and survival probability.\n",
      "White blood cells from a total of 19 patients diagnosed as having acute lymphoblastic (ALL) or acute myeloid (AML) leukaemia were analysed (36 samples) for amplification and expression of the mdr1 and mdr3 genes. Nine of the patients had samples analysed at presentation and at subsequent stages of the disease (24 samples, including 4 at second relapse). Patients received standard MRC UK Trial remission-induction treatment protocols appropriate to disease and age. No amplification of either the mdr1 or mdr3 gene was found in any of the samples, and neither were mdr3 transcripts detected by dot-blot analysis using gene-specific probes. Transcripts of the mdr1 gene were found in only 2 ALL samples (of 10). However, mdr1 transcripts were detected in all AML patients and there was a significant increase in the transcript levels in these patients who went on to first and second relapse, compared with levels measured at presentation (P < 0.001). The results support the hypothesis that P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance may be a significant factor in tumour cell resistance to chemotherapy at relapse following initial induction-remission therapy for acute myeloid leukemia.\n",
      "Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia is an atypical myeloproliferative disorder with a natural history of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia, a complex and poorly understood response by the bone marrow to stress. Cardiac surgery activates many inflammatory cascades and may precipitate a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We present a case of undiagnosed chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia who developed rapidly fatal multi-organ dysfunction following cardiac surgery due to an acute leukaemoid reaction.\n",
      "A 50-year-old woman previously diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia presented with a 3-month history of shortness of breath and a right-sided facial rash. A chest CT revealed an intracardiac mass in the right atrium extending into her superior and inferior vena cava. Surgery was performed to remove the mass and pathology was consistent with myeloid sarcoma. After surgery, adjuvant radiation therapy was directed to the residual disease. The patient eventually relapsed in other sites not including the right atrium and eventually succumbed to her disease.\n",
      "Engraftment was achieved in 43/45 (95%) recipients of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from HLA-compatible unrelated donors (n = 45), compared to all 45 patients in matched controls receiving bone marrow and 14/18 (78%) recipients of CD34-selected PBSC (P < 0.01). The time to reach ANC >0.5 x 10(9)/l was a median of 16 days in the PBSC and CD34 groups, compared to 20 days in the bone marrow controls (P < 0.001 vs PBSC). The time to reach platelets >50 x 10(9)/l was a median of 23 days in the PBSC group and 24 days in the CD34 group, which was significantly faster than 29 days in the bone marrow controls (P < 0.01). Acute GVHD grades II-IV developed in 30% in the PBSC group, 20% in the recipients of bone marrow and 18% in the CD34 group. The corresponding figures for chronic GVHD were 59%, 85% and 0% (P < 0.01) in the three groups, respectively. The probability of non-relapse death was 27% in the recipients of PBSC, 21% in the bone marrow controls and 60% in the CD34 group (NS). The 2-year leukaemia-free survival was 46% in the PBSC group, 41% in the bone marrow group and 25% in the CD34 group (NS).\n",
      "A 19-year-old woman presented to the outpatient department with occasional ocular pain and redness and a perilimbal mass, which she noticed 5 months ago in her left eye. She had no systemic complaints. Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the mass showed a hypoechoic lesion with uniform reflectivity. The patient underwent an excision biopsy and a histopathological analysis revealed features suggestive of a granulocytic sarcoma/myeloid sarcoma. Further haematopathological evaluation confirmed concurrent acute myeloid (myelomonocytic) leukaemia French American British classification M4. There was complete remission of the ocular surface lesion and leukaemia with systemic chemotherapy. At the last follow-up of 18 months post-treatment the patient is free of disease.\n",
      "AIMS: To analyze the immunophenotype of blast cells in patients with acute leukaemia after polycythemia vera, together with the most relevant clinical and haematological disease characteristics. METHODS: The immunophenotype was analysed in nine patients by immunofluorescence flow cytometry using a panel of 15 monoclonal antibodies. The DNA content of blast cells was determined using Vindelov technique. RESULTS: The most relevant clinical and haematological disease characteristics included: the presence of enlarged spleen and liver by 56% and 67%, respectively; a moderate degree of leucocytosis with thrombocytopenia while haemoglobin was normal in 50% of patients. All patients received alkylating agents or hydroxyurea, or both. Interestingly, the chronic phase in patients receiving this latter drug was shorter. All cases showed a myeloid phenotype, four of them reactive only to early myeloid antigens (CD13/33); in the remaining cases the blast cells displayed granulomonocytic (CD14+, CD15+), erythroid (CD71 ), or megakaryocytic (CD61+, CD41+) markers. Coexpression of lymphoid related antigens (CD7, TdT, or CD19) was also detected. The morphological assessment of blast cells agreed with the immunophenotyping in five out of the nine cases. Blast cells from all six patients analysed displayed a diploid DNA content and the proportion of S-phase cells ranged from 0.4% to 4%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a pluripotential stem cell with myeloid commitment as the target cell of acute leukaemia after polycythemia vera.\n",
      "The metabolism of the flavonol quercetin in human leukaemia (HL-60) cells was investigated. The fluorescence that is elicited by quercetin upon binding to a target protein was quickly attenuated in vital cells, while apoptotic cells showed persistent fluorescence. The dynamics of induction and loss of fluorescence in the cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Several potential metabolites of quercetin, apart from isorhamnetin, had weak or no fluorogenic properties with test proteins. HPLC analysis showed that quercetin was metabolised to several substances, among them glycosylated metabolites. The loss of fluorescence in vital cells offers the unique opportunity to directly observe the metabolic conversion of quercetin in human cells.\n",
      "The involvement of the BCRlABL fusion gene in patients with Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is well characterised, but the molecular events underlying the cases of Ph-negative CML and ALL that lack BCR gene involvement and those that cause transformation of Ph-positive CML are unknown. The murine ABL gene can be activated by genetic events that do not involve the BCR gene, including the introduction of two specific point mutations in exons VII and XI respectively, as found in the homologous sequence of the v-abl oncogene. We therefore sought evidence for analogous point mutations in the ABL gene in patients with Ph-negative, BCR-negative CML (n = 25), Ph-negative ALL (n = 18) and in Ph-positive CML in transformation (n = 28). We used restriction fragment length polymorphism and single strand conformational polymorphism techniques to analyse DNA amplified fragments of selected ABL coding regions from leukaemia cells. We identified only normal wild-type DNA sequences. The absence of these transforming point mutations does not exclude the possibility that the ABL gene in such patients could be activated by other means.\n",
      "To improve outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a stratified, randomised study of extended intensified chemotherapy was done. 358 evaluable patients received remission reinforcement therapy (teniposide, cytarabine, high-dose methotrexate) added to a four-drug induction regimen. Those achieving complete remission were randomised on the basis of risk group assignment to conventional continuation treatment or to four pairs of drugs rotated weekly or every 6 weeks. All patients received intrathecal chemotherapy; higher-risk patients also received 1800 cGy cranial irradiation after 1 year of remission. Complete remission was induced in 96% of the patients. At median follow-up of 40 (range 19-73) months, 4-year event-free survival (SE) was 73 (4)% overall, 81 (6)% in the lower-risk group (n = 110), and 69 (5)% in the higher-risk group (n = 248). Outcome within risk groups was not significantly affected by the speed of rotation of drug pairs during continuation treatment. Various high-risk subgroups had apparently improved responses to this treatment. This intensified chemotherapy may cure 69-77% of children with ALL.\n",
      "Transfusions are withheld, whenever possible, from patients with aplastic anaemia who are potential bone marrow transplant recipients because of the increased risk of graft failure associated with transfusions prior to transplantation. Family members are specifically excluded as blood product donors to reduce the likelihood of sensitizing the recipient to antigens shared by the blood and bone marrow donor. This policy of not using family members, particularly the HLA-matched bone marrow donor, to provide blood products prior to transplantation has been extended to leukaemia as well. To evaluate this policy we reviewed the outcome of bone marrow transplantation in 18 patients with leukaemia transfused prior to transplantation with platelets and/or leucocytes from related family members. In 15 cases in which the outcome could be evaluated, engraftment was rapid and graft failure did not occur. Transfusion of blood products from related family members to patients with leukaemia prior to transplantation does not appear, therefore, to increase the risk of graft rejection.\n",
      "Genetic abnormalities in leukaemia range from single gene defects to chromosomal translocations, inversions, losses and gains. While conventional technologies can detect macroscopic abnormalities, finding smaller regions remained a challenge until the recent introduction of high-resolution genomic platforms. Microarrays based on single nucleotide polymorphisms is one such technology. It has made possible genome-wide allelic association studies of predisposition to common clinical problems. This approach is also being used to identify somatic changes in cancer, such as loss, gain and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH), which are below the level of detection by conventional systems. Such arrays have been used to identify key genes involved in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We have used these arrays to identify regions of CN-LOH on a genome-wide scale in a large series of acute myeloid leukaemia samples, which so far has not been possible through any other technology.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an uncommon, rapidly progressive neoplasm in dogs. The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize the clinical presentation, haematologic findings, diagnostic imaging results, treatment and survival time of a contemporary cohort of dogs with AML. Diagnosis was based on >20% blasts in bone marrow or blood identified as myeloid based on morphologic findings, flow cytometric immunophenotyping and cytochemical staining. Medical records of 35 dogs diagnosed with AML from 2007 to 2015 were included. Most dogs presented with inappetence (66%) and lethargy (57%) and physical examination findings of peripheral lymphadenopathy (74%) and tachypnea (62%). Common haematologic findings were quantifiable circulating blasts (85%; median blast count 35 700/μL; range: 300-276 500/μL), anaemia (median haematocrit 34%; range: 11%-52%) and thrombocytopenia (median 57 000/μL; range: 9000-252 000/μL). Bicytopenia and pancytopenia were each found in 44% of dogs. Follow-up information was available for 34 dogs. The overall median survival time from diagnosis was 19 days (range: 1-121 days). Clinical progression in some dogs was not as rapid as previously reported. Haematologic responses to various chemotherapeutics were documented in 3 dogs, with associated survival times of 62, 103 and 121 days. Dogs treated with prednisone or a combination of chemotherapy and prednisone had improved survival compared to dogs that received symptomatic care only (P < .0001). Our results show canine AML has an overlapping clinical presentation with lymphoma. The prognosis for canine AML remains extremely guarded. Further studies are needed to optimize therapeutic regimens for dogs with AML.\n",
      "Bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent in enzootic bovine leukosis a disease occurring worldwide. This virus is normally detected by the agar gel immunodiffusion or ELISA assays which rely on the appearance of antibodies to a major surface protein of the virus, gp51, present in the serum of infected cattle. We have used the polymerase chain reaction, which depends on the amplification of specific DNA sequences as a sensitive assay for the detection of BLV. It was possible to detect proviral DNA in 100 pg of tumour DNA from an infected host using agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. The sensitivity of the assay was increased by two log orders when hybridization analysis, using a BLV proviral DNA probe, was used in combination with amplification of the DNA. Proviral DNA was detected in both lymphocytic and tumour DNA and at all stages of infection in cattle.\n",
      "With rapid advances in sequencing technologies, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), thus revealing enormous genetic and clonal heterogeneity, and paving the way for precision medicine approaches. The successful development of precision medicine for patients with AML has been exemplified by the introduction of targeted FLT3, IDH1/IDH2 and BCL-2 inhibitors. When used as single agents, these inhibitors display moderate antileukaemic activity. However, augmented clinical activity has been demonstrated when they are administered in combination with drugs with broader mechanisms of action targeting epigenetic and/or other oncogenic signalling pathways or with conventional cytotoxic agents. The development of immunotherapies has been hampered by the expression of antigens that are expressed by both leukaemic and non-malignant haematopoietic progenitor cells; nonetheless, a diverse range of immunotherapies are now entering clinical development. This myriad of emerging agents also creates challenges, such as how to safely combine agents with different mechanisms of action, the need to circumvent primary and secondary resistance, and new challenges in future clinical trial design. In this Review, we discuss the current state of precision medicine for AML, including both the potential to improve patient outcomes and the related challenges.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is rare locally. Seven CLL patients which constituted 0.9% of the total 747 cases of leukaemic patients were diagnosed over a 5 year period. They had similar haematological profiles as Western patients though most of them had advanced disease at presentation. Treatment of CLL patients was palliative and should be reserved for symptomatic patients and/or patients with progressive disease.\n",
      "Sezary cell leukaemia (SCL) is a mature T-cell leukaemia with characteristic cerebriform nuclei, whereas Sezary syndrome (SS) involves a mature T-cell lymphoma with a similar nuclear morphology. We have examined these diseases by cytogenetics chromosome painting and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Both diseases had complex cytogenetic abnormalities. All three cases of SCL investigated had inv(14)(q11:q32) and two had iso(8q). No case of SS had these abnormalities but, instead, iso(17q) or 17p+ was present in the three cases of SS investigated and FISH indicated loss of heterozygosity due to deletion of a region at 17p 13 that included the tumour suppressor gene P53, implicating it in this malignancy. One case of SCL had iso(17q). The abnormalities of chromosomes 8 and 14 in SCL are commonly observed in T-prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) and suggest that SCL may be a variant of T-PLL rather than of SS.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Leukaemia is the most prevalent form of cancer-causing death in a large number of populations and needs prompt and effective treatment. Chemotherapeutics can be used to treat leukaemia, but their pronounced killing effects to other living cells is still an issue. Active targeting to certain specific receptors in leukaemic cells is the best way to avoid damage to other living cells. Leukaemic cells can be targeted using novel nanoparticles (NPs) coated with a specific ligand, such as octreotide (OCD), to target somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2), which is expressed in leukaemic cells. METHODS: Amino-PEGylated quantum dots (QDs) were chosen as model NPs. The QDs were first succinylated using succinic anhydride and then coated with OCD. The reactivity and selectivity of the formulated QDs-OCD were studied in cell lines with well-expressed SSTR2, while fluorescence was detected using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry (FACS). Conclusively, QD-OCD targeting to blood cells was studied in vivo in mice and detected using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and CLSM in tissues. RESULTS: Highly stable QDs coated with OCD were prepared. FACS and CLSM showed highly definite interactions with overexpressed SSTR2 in the investigated cell lines. Moreover, the in vivo results revealed a higher concentration of QDs-OCD in blood cells. The fluorescence intensity of the QDs-OCD was highly accumulated in blood cells, while the unmodified QDs did not accumulate significantly in blood cells. CONCLUSION: The formulated novel QDs-OCD can target SSTR2 overexpressed in blood cells with great potential for treating blood cancer.\n",
      "We describe a case of B-prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-PLL) who, following a long-lasting remission with fluradabine, developed a Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) with bone marrow involvement. A 75-yr-old male was found to have a lymphocytosis [white blood cell (WBC) count = 146 x 10(9) L(-1)], small volume axillary lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The majority of circulating lymphocytes had a round nucleus and prominent single nucleolus. The patient did not respond to chlorambucil and then received fludarabine, achieving a good response lasting for 5 yr, when he manifested with B symptoms and pancytopenia. A diagnosis of HL in the bone marrow was made based on histology (Reed-Sternberg cells) and immunohistochemistry (CD30+, CD15+). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) studies were negative. The patient was treated with chemotherapy but died 6 months later from disease progression.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: This article explores how children use fantasy, play, and coping (imaginal coping) in order to handle chronic illness. Imaginal coping, as a theoretical construct, is defined as the use of imagination to deal with the hardships of illness. The overarching aim has been to investigate the various ways in which categories of staff members (doctors, nurses, play therapists, and hospital clowns) and parents support children in their coping. Focus has thus been on collaborative or interactive aspects of playful coping. METHOD: A large proportion of the data collected consists of 93 h of video-recorded interactions between children, parents and staff. The collection of data involved fieldwork carried out with the use of a video ethnographic method, making it possible thereby to analyse and work with data in greater detail. For more than one year, five children with leukaemia were followed as each made their regular visits to a children cancer clinic in a children hospital in Sweden. RESULTS: Collaborative storytelling, humorous treatment practices, playful rituals, as well as role-reversal play, were all types of events involving staff-child collaboration and creative improvisation. CONCLUSIONS: Staff, along with parents, played a significant role in the coping process. In various ways, the staff members helped the parents to respond to their children in ways adaptive for coping. It can be seen that imaginal coping is a highly interactional business. In this study it is shown that parents socialize coping; this is sometimes undertaken explicitly, for example, through coaching (in the form of instructions or suggestions) and teaching. But often it is achieved through modelling or intent participation, with the child observing staff members' treatment practices.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To correlate clinical presentation and therapeutic outcomes in children with a diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia. METHODS: The medical records of 14 children who fulfilled the International Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia Working Group Criteria for a diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) presenting to a single institution were reviewed, and their clinical status at September 2000 was documented. RESULTS: The most common presenting features were hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Fifty per cent of cases presented in the first year of life. Nine of 14 patients initially received chemotherapy otherwise used in the treatment of acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukaemia with no apparent benefit. All six patients who received conditioning therapy with chemotherapy alone, followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT), are in complete remission at a median follow-up duration of 12 months (range 5-91 months). Five of six patients surviving post-allogeneic BMT received marrow from an unrelated donor. Only one of seven patients who did not receive BMT survived long-term. CONCLUSION: Children with a diagnosis of JMML should be treated with allogeneic BMT as soon as a suitable donor is found. The role of anti-leukaemic therapy in this disease, prior to BMT, requires further investigation in the context of a multicentre clinical trial.\n",
      "Blood findings in 61 cases of generalized mastocytosis (GM) were evaluated. The cases were divided into two major variants: Systemic mastocytosis (SM; n = 34) with urticaria pigmentosa-like skin lesions, and malignant mastocytosis (MM; n = 27), without skin involvement. The following results were obtained: (1) Significant differences between MM and SM were found in the main haematological parameters (erythrocyte, platelet and leucocyte counts and haemoglobin level); normal values were found in 16 of the SM cases, but never in MM. (2) The main pathological findings were: in SM, anaemia (9/34) and leucocytosis (5/34); and in MM, leucocytosis (19/27), monocytosis (14/27), eosinophilia (12/27), bicytopenia (12/27, mostly anaemia with thrombocytopenia), basophilia (10/27) and isolated anaemia (7/27). (3) The major finding was a significant difference between MM and SM in the incidence of myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), myelodysplasia and mast cell leukaemia (MCL): these disorders occurred in 23 (92%) MM patients, but only in two (6%) SM patients (P less than 0.001). The four instances of MCL and two of myelodysplasia all occurred with MM. Of the 19 cases of MPD, six (SM, 1; MM, 5) were acute variants (acute myeloid and myelomonocytic leukaemias) and 13 (SM, 1; MM, 12) were chronic variants. No case of malignant lymphoma was noted. (4) The blood picture in 10 of 13 chronic MPD cases represented an atypical chronic myeloid leukaemia for which the preliminary descriptive term 'mastocytosis-associated MPD' is proposed. (5) A survey of 103 published cases (SM, 77; MM, 26) yielded similar findings, including a high incidence of MPD and MCL in MM. These findings add further weight to the argument for recognizing SM and MM as two separate entities.\n",
      "AIMS: To analyse and characterize the ultrastructural morphology of normal tissue mast cells (MC) and neoplastic bone marrow MC. METHODS: We have examined the ultrastructure and cytomorphological features of MC derived from cord blood cells, neoplastic bone marrow MC in patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM, n = 4), myelomastocytic leukaemia (MML, n = 2), mast cell leukaemia (MCL, n = 2) and tryptase-positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 4). RESULTS: Based on their ultrastructure and morphology, four distinct cell types could be delineated: (i) mature well-granulated tissue MC exhibiting a round central nucleus; (ii) atypical MC type I with oval nuclei, hypogranulated cytoplasm, and prominent surface projections; (iii) immature atypical MC with bi- or polylobed nuclei (atypical MC type II = promastocytes); and (iv) metachromatic blasts. Type I atypical MC were detected in a patient with indolent SM, whereas type II MC and metachromatic blasts were primarily found in MML, MCL and tryptase-positive AML. In all samples examined, the identity of MC could be reconfirmed by immunoelectron microscopy, irrespective of the stage of cell maturation or the disease variant, all types of MC contained tryptase in their cytoplasmic granules. CONCLUSION: Immunoelectron microscopy may be a helpful approach in confirming the identity of neoplastic MC in myeloid neoplasms.\n",
      "The role of cytogenetic findings in determining the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has become more valuable by the day. In this study, the results of conventional and molecular cytogenetic analyses and clinical outcomes of 66 AML patients of different subgroups aged between 16 and 82 were evaluated. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 17 (25.7%) patients cytogenetically at the time of diagnosis, whereas molecular cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 21 (31.8%) patients by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Thirty-eight (57.6%) patients had a normal karyotype. In 8 patients, we did not obtain suitable chromosomes for karyotype analysis and in 3 patients conventional cytogenetics were not requested by the physician. During clinical follow-up, 21 patients (31.8%) achieved complete remission (CR), 2 had partial remission (PR) (3.0%) and 4 patients had progressive disease (6.06%). Twenty-eight (42.4%) patients died during treatment and no follow-up data were available in 7 cases. Among patients with chromosome abnormalities detected by either one of the two cytogenetic methods (n=28), 12 had achieved CR, 9 of whom were already categorised in the good prognostic group with t(15;17), inv16 or t(8;21). As for the normal karyotype, each patient displayed a different clinical course, which is probably due to the molecular changes in leukaemia-related genes. Here we report our findings, which correlate with previous reports and conclude that cytogenetics is a crucial marker in leukaemia diagnosis and conventional and molecular cytogenetics should be performed as well as molecular genetic diagnostic methods.\n",
      "Deletions involving chromosome 6q have been reported in a number of human cancers such as ovarian and breast tumours as well as haematopoietic malignancies. It seems that this region might contain tumour-suppressor genes. Putative natural killer cell lymphomas/leukaemias (NKLL) represent a group of recently characterized haematolymphoid malignancies sharing an immunophenotype of CD3/Leu4- CD3epsilon+ CD56+, a genotype of germline T-cell receptor genes, and have a close association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Deletion at 6q21-q25 was demonstrated in three recently reported cases of NKLL. Here we investigated the possible involvement of 6q deletions in the pathogenesis, and especially the tumorigenesis of NKLL. The regions of D6S1574 (6p25), DS276 (6p12), D6S257 (6q11), D6S434 (6q14), D6S287 (6q15), D6S292 (6q21), D6S308 (6q22), D6S264 (6q25), and D6S446 (6q26) were analysed by PCR in 25 cases of NKLL, including seven cases with chronic NK leukaemia, six with acute NK leukaemia and 12 with NK lymphoma. 6q deletions, especially 6q15-25, were frequently detected, but 6p deletions were not detected in any cases. Analysis of 6q21 showed possible deletion in two of seven cases (29%) with chronic NK leukaemia, three of six (50%) with acute leukaemia, and 12 of 12 (100%) with NK lymphoma. The frequency of deletion increased in clinical phases. In three cases with lymphoma, fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed, which confirmed 6q21 deletion in two cases, although 6q telomeric and centromeric regions were preserved. The other case failed to show deletion. Our results suggest that 6q deletion, especially 6q21-25, might be involved in NKLL tumorigenesis, and support the presence of the tumour suppressor genes associated with the development of NKLL.\n",
      "Remission duration data from two observational studies, the German ALL/AUL study on acute lymphoblastic and acute undifferentiated leukaemia and the Kiel Lymphoma Study, are used to demonstrate the adequacy of an interval-censoring approach. The Turnbull estimator is contrasted with the conventionally used Kaplan-Meier estimator. In addition, a parametric model is used for estimation or simulation of the delay times of complete remission diagnosis and relapse diagnosis. Two possible consequences of the conventional approach are discussed: biased estimation (for example, overestimation of remission duration), and underestimation of the true error variance, which may lead to false positive results. On the other hand, the applicability of the interval-censoring approach is doubtful when the censoring mechanism (examination pattern, patient behaviour) is confounded with the endpoints.\n",
      "We studied the chromosomes in the bone marrow of 4 patients who had both diabetes insipidus (DI) and acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. Clinical findings suggested that, in each case, myelodysplastic syndrome had preceded the onset of acute leukaemia. Two other such patients described in the literature had had a banded karyotype study of bone marrow cells. All 6 patients had deletions of chromosome 7. 3 had monosomy 7 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality, 2 had monosomy 7 associated with other clonal abnormalities and 1 had del(7)(q22) in association with other abnormalities. These data suggest that monosomy 7 or perhaps monosomy for 7q22-qter predisposes to DI. The mechanism by which the proposed predisposition is produced remains to be clarified.\n",
      "The occasional finding of cells positive for the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome months or years after bone-marrow transplantation for chronic myeloid leukaemia raises the possibility that the Ph-positive clone may never be eradicated. The polymerase chain reaction with probes able to detect the transcript of the bcr/abl hybrid gene at very low levels was used to study marrow cells from seven patients in continuing haematological and cytogenetic remission 5-7 years after allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation for chronic myeloid leukaemia. No evidence of the leukaemic mRNA was found. Thus, it seems that all leukaemic cells were eradicated in these patients and that they are truly cured.\n",
      "We investigated the role of maternal alcohol and coffee drinking during pregnancy and that of parental smoking in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. A French, population-based, case-control study was conducted, comparing 472 [407 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 62 acute myeloblastic leukaemia] cases of childhood acute leukaemia (AL) and 567 population controls, frequency-matched with cases on age, gender and region of residence. Both case and control mothers filled in a comprehensive self-administered standardised questionnaire, eliciting detailed data on maternal alcohol and coffee consumption during pregnancy and parental smoking before, during and after pregnancy. Maternal alcohol consumption of more than 1 drink per day was related to ALL (OR = 2.8 [95% CI 1.8, 5.9]). While maternal coffee consumption was not significantly related to AL (OR = 1.4 [95% CI 0.9, 2.3]), highest intake of coffee (more than 3 cups per day) during pregnancy was associated with AL in children whose mothers were non-smokers (OR = 1.9 [95% CI 1.0, 3.5]). No association with parental smoking, either maternal or paternal, was observed with AL. The present results suggest a possible role of the highest consumption of alcohol by the mother during pregnancy in the aetiology of childhood AL.\n",
      "5 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) have been treated by BMT from identical twin donors. Syngeneity of the twins was established by conventional methods in the first 2 patients. These included the similarity of phenotype, dermatoglyphics and analysis of red cell isoenzymes and blood groups. 2 of the other patients had received multiple blood transfusions prior to referral for BMT thereby invalidating red cell analysis. However genetic identity was confirmed in these patients by the method of DNA 'finger-printing' which demonstrated identical restriction-fragment length polymorphisms. Conclusive proof of syngeneity in twins prior to BMT is important since it obviates the need for T-cell depletion and/or post-graft immunosuppression to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). All 5 patients were conditioned with high-dose chemoradiotherapy prior to BMT and all patients are alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 12 months. In conclusion, we report a new, reliable method for determining syngeneity of twins which has bearing on the technical approach to BMT.\n",
      "We have analysed survival time and complete remission (CR) rate after induction treatment including cytosine arabinoside and an anthracycline antibiotic in 94 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, comparing the results in four different groups according to the presence or absence of Auer rods and the presence (AN/AA) or absence (NN) of abnormal cytogenetic clones at diagnosis. The finding of Auer rods was a positive prognostic factor with respect to CR rate (p less than 0.02) and survival time (p less than 0.02) irrespective of the cytogenetic pattern. The AN/AA pattern was associated with lower CR rate (p less than 0.05) and 6-months survival (p = 0.05) in the 49 Auer rod-negative patients. In the 45 patients with Auer rods, no significant differences in CR rate or survival were seen between AN/AA and NN patients. We conclude that the negative prognostic impact of chromosome abnormalities in acute myeloid leukaemia might be restricted to Auer rod-negative disease.\n",
      "Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 patients with acute leukaemia were used to establish long-term interleukin-2-dependent cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Cells were grown in RPMI medium containing interleukin-2 (IL-2, 100 U/ml) and 2.5% conditioned medium prepared by activating normal lymphocytes with phytohaemagglutinin. Proliferation of IL-2-dependent CD3-positive lymphocytes was seen in 1 of 2 acute lymphocytic leukaemia cases (ALL), 1 of 4 acute myelogenous leukaemia cases (AML) (M1) and 8 of 8 more differentiated AML. In 2 cases with detectable leukaemic cell markers (1 ALL and 1 AML) passageable cells were developed, that expressed normal T cell phenotypes (namely CD3, CD4 and CD8) at the expense of leukaemic cells. In 1 of 2 cases, long-term IL-2-cultured cells showed specific cytotoxic activity against autologous leukemic cells. The percentage killing against autologous and two allogeneic target cell lines at a 50/1 effector/target (E/T) ratio was 42%, 9% and 19% respectively. Similarly the cytotoxic activity of IL-2 activated from 4 different individuals against conventional tumour targets K562 and Daudi at a ratio of 50/1 was 29%-68% (median = 55%) and 34%-78% (median = 61%) respectively. It was also found that this killing potential of the activated cells was maintained for as long as culture was continued (median 23 days, range 17-75 days). The mechanism(s) of T cell proliferation at the expense of leukaemic blast cells in the case of a minority of leukaemic patients and the possible clinical therapeutic potential of these cells following in vitro IL-2 activation deserve further investigation.\n",
      "The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor (uPAR) focuses uPA proteolytic activity on the cell membrane, promoting localized degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM), and binds vitronectin (VN), mediating cell adhesion to the ECM. uPAR-bound uPA and VN induce proteolysis-independent intracellular signalling, regulating cell adhesion, migration, survival and proliferation. uPAR cross-talks with CXCR4, the receptor for the stroma-derived factor 1 chemokine. CXCR4 is crucial in the trafficking of hematopoietic stem cells from/to the bone marrow, which involves also uPAR. Both uPAR and CXCR4 are expressed in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), with a lower expression in undifferentiated and myeloid subsets, and higher expression in myelomonocytic and promyelocytic subsets. We hypothesized a microRNA (miR)-mediated co-regulation of uPAR and CXCR4 expression, which could allow their cross-talk at the cell surface. We identified three miRs, miR-146a, miR-335 and miR-622, regulating the expression of both uPAR and CXCR4 in AML cell lines. Indeed, these miRs directly target the 3'untranslated region of both uPAR- and CXCR4-mRNAs; accordingly, uPAR/CXCR4 expression is reduced by their overexpression in AML cells and increased by their specific inhibitors. Overexpression of all three miRs impairs migration, invasion and proliferation of myelomonocytic cells. Interestingly, we observed an inverse relationship between uPAR/CXCR4 expression and miR-146a and miR-335 levels in AML blasts, suggesting their possible role in the regulation of uPAR/CXCR4 expression also in vivo.\n",
      "The evolution of leukaemia was studied prospectively in 29 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) followed for 2-6 years by sequential blast counts, cell kinetics derived from quantitative 14C-autoradiography and karyotype analysis. Overt leukaemia developed in seven patients. Two distinct patterns of leukaemic evolution were identified. The first was characterized by a gradual increase in blast cell count and in the frequency of labelled blasts, and a corresponding reduction in myeloid maturation index indicating increased intracompartmental myeloblast divisions and premature myeloid cell death. A second pattern of leukaemic evolution was marked by a sudden rise in the blast cell population in a previously stable MDS. This rise was attributed both to an increased rate of blast proliferation, and the accumulation of non-proliferating blasts. In an additional patient with smouldering ANLL and multiple karyotype abnormalities, transient clinical remission took place following prednisone and oxymetholone therapy, characterized by a sideroblastic morphology, normal karyotype, and persistence of a highly abnormal myeloid maturation index. The sudden emergence of overt leukaemia in previously stable MDS in some of our patients and the temporary reversal of overt leukaemia into sideroblastic anaemia in one case, lend support to the notion of leukaemic evolution by several steps of transformation. On the other hand, the gradual transition of MDS into overt leukaemia in other patients is compatible with a single step leukaemia transformation, although the possibility of clonal disease prior to the development of MDS cannot be excluded with certainty.\n",
      "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) should be classified into subtypes according to the French-American-British (FAB) or, preferably, the newer World Health Organization (WHO) classification schemes. FAB is purely a morphological classification. It does not determine treatment (except M3) or prognosis for the patient which requires cytogenetics. Haematological analyzer had been used for classification of leukaemia in several studies. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity (MPXI) can be performed by Technicon H1 (Bayer) automated cell counter. The aim of this study was the statement of myeloperoxidase index and subgroups of AML. In the study of medical records of 72 patients with AML from 2006-7, we found that MPXI was negative in M4 and M5 while 75% of M3 cases had high MPXI values. MPXI level may help to differentiate subtypes of AML.\n",
      "The clinical course of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) has changed over the last 25 years from one that was fatal for the majority of patients to representing one of the most curable subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia. Besides improved supportive care this has mainly been achieved through the introduction of novel targeted therapies in the form of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide that specifically address the underlying molecular lesion. APL is characterized by chromosomal rearrangements of 17q21 leading to the formation of fusion proteins involving retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA). To date five different fusion partners of RARA have been identified, but the vast majority of cases are characterized by the presence of the t(15;17)(q22;q12-21), which involves the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) gene. The identification of different breakpoint microclusters within RARA intron 2 suggests that sequence-associated or structural factors play a role in the formation of the t(15;17). In addition, the comparison of forward and reverse genomic junctions has revealed microhomologies, deletions and/or duplications of either gene consistent with the hypothesis that the t(15;17) occurs by non-homologous recombination of DNA after processing of the double strand breaks by a dysfunctional DNA damage repair mechanism. The detection of the PML-RARA fusion gene by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is routinely used for diagnosis and monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). In PML-RARA-positive APL about 70% of patients are expected to be cured with a combination of ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. However, relapse remains a major problem. The identification of patients at high risk of relapse and the development of risk-adapted treatment schedules are therefore clearly the most challenging tasks in the treatment of APL. Recent studies have shown that pre-emptive chemotherapy at the time of molecular relapse improves survival compared to treatment at the point of haematological relapse. Quantitative RT-PCR technology is expected to further improve the predictive value of MRD monitoring and therefore to guide therapy in order to reduce the rate of relapses and to increase rates of cure in high-risk patients.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: Only a small number of studies have reported on the association of parental occupational exposure to benzene and risk of childhood and adolescent leukaemias. We examined associations with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in this population-based study in Denmark. METHODS: Benzene was largely banned from Danish workplaces after 1975, thus this case-control study focused on the immediately prior years. Paediatric cancer cases (<age 20) were ascertained from the Danish Cancer Registry among children born 1968-1974, and controls were selected from population records. Paternal occupation within the 3 months preconception and maternal pregnancy occupation were identified from nationwide pension fund records. Blinded, we assigned benzene exposure using a job-exposure matrix that had been developed for the Danish population. Risk for ALL was estimated using conditional logistic regression. In an exploratory analysis, we also examined other cancers with at least five case parents exposed. RESULTS: We identified 217 employed case fathers and 169 employed case mothers, of which 22 (10.1%) and 11 (6.5%), respectively, were exposed to benzene (vs 6.7% and 2.9% of control fathers and mothers). Most exposed parents worked as machine or engine mechanics, or in the shoe industry. Maternal occupational exposure to benzene in pregnancy was related to increased risk of ALL in offspring (adjusted OR=2.28, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.41), while paternal preconceptional benzene exposure was not as strongly associated (adjusted OR=1.40, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.22). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports an increased risk for ALL with parental occupational benzene exposure.\n",
      "Despite the fact that 80% of adult acute myeloid leukaemia patients reach complete morphological remission after induction chemotherapy, many of them relapse. Many studies have shown that detection of minimal residual disease (defined as 'any detectable evidence of persistent leukaemic cells during complete morphological remission') has an added value in prediction of relapse and survival, and is more than just a surrogate marker for already known risk factors in AML. As such, the behaviour of the disease during treatment might become equally or even more important to decide whether or not an upgrade of treatment (such as an allogeneic stem cell transplantation) is necessary to improve outcome. However, there are still many open issues as to what the ideal time point is to measure MRD, which threshold is clinically significant, what sample (peripheral blood or bone marrow) should be used and how we can standardize tests so that results from different labs become comparable. This review gives an overview of currently available evidence regarding technical issues, prognostic impact and MRD-directed treatment in AML.\n",
      "A total of 40 patients presenting with chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic transformation were treated with a non-aggressive chemotherapy regimen consisting of vincristine, cytosine arabinoside and thioguanine. Remissions were achieved by 3/10 (30%) patients displaying lymphoid transformation (remission duration, 2, 3, and 5 months, respectively) and by 5/30 (17%) subjects exhibiting myeloid changes (duration 2+, 4, 4, 5 and 7 months, respectively). Myelosuppression was the major toxicity and non-haematological toxicities were mild and acceptable. The median survival of patients exhibiting lymphoid and myeloid blastic transformation as measured from the time of transformation was 6 and 3 months, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. Three subjects displaying lymphoid transformation and five showing myeloid changes survived for greater than 12 months after the time of transformation.\n",
      "Following the limited success of T-cell depletion in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), recent interest is focused on autologous BMT. The selection of sensitive methods for detecting residual lymphoid malignancy, the choice of very efficient complement-fixing lytic monoclonal antibodies against residual disease, and the \"tailoring\" of these antibodies (or their cocktails) to individual patients lead to a very high remission rate in acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) of bad prognosis and second remission. The future of this extension of chemotherapy toward BMT seems to be promising, but controlled trials are required to show that the purging of bone marrow contributes to this good result. Very efficient antibodies for elimination of B lymphoma cells are also available.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Functional polymorphisms of the ABCG2 gene may contribute to individual variability in drug response and the prognosis of patients. METHODS: In the present study, the genetic polymorphisms and expression of ABCG2 were analysed in blasts cells obtained from 184 Chinese patients with de novo acute leukaemia to investigate their possible association with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A novel synonymous ABCG2-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at exon 16 (13561218 C/T) and five known SNPs at exon 2 (13608835 G/A), exon 5 (13600044 C/A), intron 10 (13576005 C/T), intron 13 (13564503 C/T) and intron 14 (13563578 A/G) were identified with occurrence rates of 1.1%, 64.1%, 30.4%, 21.2%, 39.7% and 28.8%, respectively. We found that patients with the ABCG2 34GG genotype displayed longer disease free survival (DFS) (P<0.001) and overall survival (OS) (P<0.001) than those with the 34GA/AA genotypes. Furthermore, the DFS and OS were significantly diminished in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients with the 34GA/AA genotypes relative to those with the 34GG genotype. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that these highly prevalent ABCG2 34GA/AA genotypes are associated with poor prognosis of Chinese patients with acute leukaemia and BMT patients.\n",
      "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family belongs to type I receptor tyrosine kinases. Overexpression or mutation of EGFR/ErbB1 gene has been detected in a large number of human solid tumours. According to some previous report, this gene is not expressed in hematological malignancies. However, two recent clinical case reports showed that erlotinib caused complete remission of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)-M1 in patients who had both AML-M1 and non-small-cell lung cancer. These results are supported by preclinical studies in which EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have anti-proliferative effects on AML. These findings prompted us to determine whether EGFR is expressed in human AML, through a large-scale screening of both leukaemic cell lines and clinical samples. Our results show that EGFR is expressed by about 33% of human AML (containing M1 to M7 subtypes) and by some human leukaemia cell lines (K562, MEG-01, CEM and SKO-007). Its expression is not limited to certain AML types but has been detected in many leukaemic cells. In addition, EGFR expression was intimately associated with the poor clinical outcomes. Finally, we find that only EGFR-positive leukaemic cells respond to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of cetuximab, the monoclonal antibodies against EGFR.\n",
      "In 1985 Lansdown and Benjamin published a study on the development of the concept of death in healthy children. The study reported here uses the same methodology but reports on the concepts of death of 21 children with leukaemia between 4 and 9 years of age. The leukaemic children conceptual development was not overall significantly different from that of the healthy children although there were some differences in content. Two further areas were studied. The first was children ideas about the causes of illness, in which the widely postulated notion of immanent justice was not found to be common. The second was an analysis of drawings of children families which suggested that sick children perceive themselves to be isolated in hospital.\n",
      "Recent investigations have clarified some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the t(15;17) translocation specific for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Together with providing new insights into the pathogenesis of the disease, the identification of breakpoints within the RAR-alpha and PML loci on chromosomes 17 and 15 has allowed a new relevant diagnostic tool for the recognition of this leukaemic form. We report the molecular characterization of 6 cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) in which a diagnosis of typical M3 by conventional morphocytochemistry (FAB criteria) was not accompanied by cytogenetic evidence of the specific t(15;17) aberration. DNA rearrangements were documented in all cases at the PML and RAR-alpha loci. Moreover, in 4 cases also analysed by Northern blot hybridization, we could detect aberrant RAR-alpha transcripts. These findings highlight the specificity of PML/RAR-alpha rearrangements in APL, whereas the lack of t(15;17) may be attributed to sub-microscopic translocations as well as to the presence of non-neoplastic cells undergoing mitosis in the samples examined for karyotype.\n",
      "Stem cell transplantation (SCT) may be the only curative option for patients with relapsed or refractory leukaemia, that is, high-risk (HR) leukaemia. Several salvage regimens have been used to cytoreduce disease before SCT, but disease progression or treatment toxicity limits numbers of patients receiving SCT. Here, we report our experience with high-dose cytarabine and amsacrine (Ara-amsa) to salvage patients with HR-leukaemia in the context of SCT. A total of 34 patients with HR-leukaemia (20 AML, 12 ALL, two advanced CML) received 3 g/m(2)/day cytarabine for 5 days and amsacrine 200 mg/m(2)/day for 3 days. Disease response was observed in 62% of patients. Toxicity was limited to neutropenic fever, one patient developed cerebellar toxicity and there was one treatment-related death. A total of 17 patients proceeded to SCT (12 allografts and five autografts). Median survival (OS) of all patients was 10.8 months (95% CI 7.8-21). Patients who were consolidated with SCT after salvage therapy had a superior median OS of 29.4 months (95% CI 12.5-upper limit not reached, n=17) than those who did not receive SCT (6.7 months, CI 1.5-8.6, P<0.0001). Median disease-free survival with SCT (23 months) was higher than after treatment with salvage chemotherapy alone (6.7 months, P=0.0002). Thus Ara-amsa can be used effectively to salvage HR-leukaemia, enabling further consolidation with SCT.\n",
      "Cell based therapies for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have made significant progress in the last decade benefiting the prognosis and survival of patients with this aggressive form of leukaemia. Due to advances in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and particularly the advent of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), the scope of transplantation has now extended to those patients previously ineligible due to age and health restrictions and has been associated with a decrease in transplant related mortality. The apparent graft versus leukaemia (GvL) effect observed following HSCT demonstrates the potential of the immune system to target and eradicate AML cells. Building on previously published pre-clinical studies by ourselves and others, we are now initiating a Phase I clinical study in which lentiviral vectors are used to genetically modify AML cells to express B7.1 (CD80) and IL-2. By combining allogeneic HSCT with immunisation, using the autologous AML cells expressing B7.1 and IL-2, we hope to stimulate immune eradication of residual AML cells in poor prognosis patients that have achieved donor chimerism. In this report we describe the background to cell therapy based approaches for AML, and discuss difficulties associated with the deployment of a chronically stimulated, hence exhausted/depleted immune system to eradicate tumour cells that have already escaped immune surveillance.\n",
      "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, DNA damage inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4), has inducible expression in response to various cellular stresses. In multiple malignancies, studies have shown that DDIT4 participates in tumorigenesis and impacts patient survival. We aimed to study the prognostic value of DDIT4 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is currently unclear. Firstly, The Cancer Genome Atlas was screened for AML patients with complete clinical characteristics and DDIT4 expression data. A total of 155 patients were included and stratified according to the treatment modality and the median DDIT4 expression levels. High DDIT4 expressers had shorter overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) than the low expressers among the chemotherapy-only group (all P < .001); EFS and OS were similar in the high and low DDIT4 expressers of the allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) group. Furthermore, in the DDIT4high group, patients treated with allo-HSCT had longer EFS and OS than those who received chemotherapy alone (all P < .01). In the DDIT4low group, OS and EFS were similar in different treatment groups. Secondly, we analysed two other cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) cohorts derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which confirmed that high DDIT4 expression was associated with poorer survival. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the genes related to DDIT4 expression were mainly concentrated in the acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia signalling pathways. Collectively, our study indicates that high DDIT4 expression may serve as a poor prognostic factor for AML, but its prognostic effects could be outweighed by allo-HSCT.\n",
      "Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common subtype of ALL in adults. Conventional chemotherapy-based approaches that are effective in other precursor B cell ALL cases have a poor chances of cure in patients with a Ph+ diagnosis. Therefore, allogeneic stem cell transplantation performed during the first remission is the recommended therapy. Recently, the availability of imatinib mesylate and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors and small molecules that affect the BCR/ABL signalling pathways has introduced a new therapeutic opportunity, and could change the treatment paradigm and prognosis for these patients. In this article, the results from clinical trials using imatinib in relapsed/refractory patients and as front-line therapy are described. In addition, preliminary experiences with novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors in imatinib-resistant Ph+ ALL are discussed.\n",
      "In most centers allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is restricted to patients with HLA-identical siblings as donors. We have transplanted 16 patients with marrow of donors other than HLA-identical siblings. Seven patients were grafted in the years 1978 until 1984. Six died of transplant complications and one of recurrent leukemia. More recently 9 patients were transplanted following an improved immunosuppressive conditioning treatment derived from experimental studies in dogs. Four are alive and in continuous remission between more than 2 months and 2 years. 5 patients died, 3 from fungal infections, one from recurrent leukaemia and one early from endothelial leakage syndrome. Our results indicate that intensified immunosuppressive conditioning may improve the results of marrow transplantation from HLA-haploidentical donors.\n",
      "The influence of IL-3 on the bone marrow cells of 53 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was investigated after 72 h suspension in cultures by analysing the proliferation of blasts and the secretion of cytokines. The titres of IL-1beta IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-3 were measured in the supernatants of these cultures with ELISA tests. Comparing the percentage of cells in S-phases of control cultures and cultures with IL-3, the leukaemias were divided into two growth pattern groups: IL-3-insensitive (n=19) and IL-3-sensitive (n=34) leukaemias. The IL-3-insensitive AML cells show a greater ability for autonomous growth, first by the increase of S-phase in the control culture compared with the S-phase in vivo (P=0.0486) and second, by the higher constitutive secretion (control culture) of IL-1beta P =0.0004), IL-6 ( P =0.0395) and TNF-alpha P=0.0005). The IL-3-induced secondary cytokine secretion is also different in the two growth pattern groups. Whereas in the IL-3-insensitive AML cells a moderate increase of IL-1beta (1.48-fold increase) was present, in the IL-3-sensitive AML cells a 4.72-fold increase of IL-1beta 2.71-fold increase of IL-6 and 11.81-fold increase of the TNF-alpha titre could be detected. Overall, the data show an inverse correlation between the ability of AML cells to respond to IL-3 with increase of an S-phase and the constitutive secretion of IL-1beta, II-6 and TNF-alpha. A further effect of IL-3 is the induction of secondary cytokine secretion in the bone marrow of IL-3-sensitive growing AML cells.\n",
      "A study of absolute basophil counts and plasma levels of highly sulphated glycosaminoglycans in 30 peripheral blood samples from 21 patients with different leukaemias was performed. This revealed significantly raised levels of both plasma highly sulphated glycosaminoglycans and basophils in those patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, as compared to those with other types of leukaemia and 35 normal controls. A strong correlation (r = 0.83) was observed between the levels of highly sulphated glycosaminoglycans and basophil counts in the group as a whole, supporting a direct relationship between the two. The elevated plasma levels of highly sulphated glycosaminoglycans may contribute to the bleeding tendency reported in some patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "We report a case of aplastic anaemia (AA) treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) terminating as acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). Because of severe pneumonia, 250 micrograms of G-CSF was administered for 30 d to promote neutrophil recovery. Following G-CSF therapy, myeoblasts appeared, and the diagnosis of AML was then made. The myeloblasts proliferated in response to G-CSF in vitro and in vivo. In AA, development of AML after treatment with G-CSF is rare. Therefore a careful observation for leukaemic transformation is necessary in long-term administration of G-CSF for AA.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a life-saving but intensive procedure associated with potentially severe adverse late effects. We aimed to determine morbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a sample of survivors aged 8-18 years at least 1 year post HSCT for paediatric acute leukaemia, compared with a non-transplanted group of survivors matched for age, gender, initial disease and time since treatment. METHODS: Families (N = 54; HSCT n= 29) recruited from four UK centres completed measures of child behaviour and school attendance, HRQOL and finances. Mothers completed measures of their own well-being. Clinical outcome data were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: Children in the HSCT group had significantly more late effects and had received more tests for vision, bone, dental and skin health, and thyroid, lung, and gonadal function than the non-transplanted group. HRQOL scores for the HSCT group were significantly lower in all domains compared with the non-transplanted group and population norms, but were not significantly related to clinical indices. Mothers in the HSCT group had significantly poorer mental well-being than population norms. CONCLUSION: Significant morbidity and compromised HRQOL was found in survivors of HSCT. The burden of caring for a child after HSCT has a continuing toll on mothers' well-being.The importance of counselling families about possible long-term consequences is emphasized.\n",
      "Ring finger proteins contain a characteristic ring finger motif and perform a wide range of biological functions in living organisms. These genes are abnormally expressed in many cancers. We found that the expression level of Ring finger protein 220 (RNF220) was negatively correlated with the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. Moreover, the mRNA level of this gene is significantly higher in the bone marrow cells of AML patients than in the mobilized peripheral blood haematopoietic stem cells of healthy donors. The overexpression of RNF220 promotes the proliferation of AML cells and accelerates the transition from G1 phase to S phase. Increased protein levels and decreased ubiquitylation levels of Cyclin D1 were observed in the nuclei of cells overexpressing RNF220 compared to those of control cells. The protein level of USP22 was also increased in cells overexpressing RNF220. RNF220 cannot enhance the stability of the Cyclin D1 protein without increased expression of the USP22 protein. Our study provided proof of principle to show that RNF220 promotes stabilization of the Cyclin D1 protein via USP22.\n",
      "Clinical and biological features were assessed in 114 consecutive previously untreated adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients whose diagnosis was based on FAB criteria and detailed immunophenotyping. All patients received standard intensive chemotherapy. The main purpose of this study was to establish the prognostic value, if any, of terminal transferase (TdT) expression in myeloid leukaemia. TdT positive cells (7-80% of total blast cells) were detected in 40% of the cases. Among clinical characteristics, a low lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (less than 250 I.U.) (P = 0.003), a low initial white blood cell count (less than 10 x 10(9)/l) (P = 0.002), and an absolute neutrophil count (less than 5 x 10(9)/l) (P = 0.02) were associated with TdT-positivity. FAB classification was not predictive of TdT expression, and there was no difference in the distribution of FAB subtypes between the groups. Multivariate analysis combining clinical and laboratory data indicated that a low expression of the monocytic antigen CD14 was predictive of TdT positivity in AML (P = 0.01). Karyotyping showed no difference in the pattern of occurrence of specific abnormalities between the TdT+ and the TdT- group. When clinical and immunophenotype data were included in a prognostic model, the patient age was highly predictive of response (P less than 0.001), and only the CDw65 antigen contributed to the response model (P = 0.07). TdT+ patients with a low expression of CD11b achieved a higher frequency of response at a borderline level of significance (P = 0.06). Frequency of response to chemotherapy, the response duration or overall survival were not influenced by TdT expression.\n",
      "Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that can present in varied ways from incidental finding on haemogram to symptomatic presentation such as splenomegaly. We report an interesting case of a 22-year-old man who presented with loss of vision in right eye for 1 month. There were no pre-existing ocular or systemic diseases. On detailed ocular examination, a diagnosis of right eye rubeosis iridis, hyphaema, cataract and vitreous haemorrhage with left eye suspected leukaemic retinopathy was made. Routine haemogram revealed high leucocytosis. Systemic evaluation with investigations confirmed the diagnosis of CML and the patient was started on appropriate therapy.\n",
      "One hundred and sixty one children who have developed more than one primary neoplasm have been identified. Children with tumours of the central nervous system, retinoblastoma and leukaemia were those most frequently observed to develop a second malignancy whilst osteosarcoma was the most common second tumour. The patterns of second neoplasms appear to be changing and a recent increase in the number of children with leukaemia and lymphoma who develop second primary tumours has been observed. In this series, the two most frequent associations of tumours were retinoblastoma followed by osteosarcoma and the combination of acute leukaemia with a tumour of the central nervous system. Genetic factors which may have contributed to the development of the second primary tumour were identified in 53 patients (33%), 33 of whom had the genetic form of retinoblastoma. In an analysis of the treatment of 151 patients, for whom the interval between the two neoplasms was greater than 12 months, the second malignancy was considered to be 'radiation associated' in 93 (61%). Fifty children (33%) had been treated with either single or multiple agent chemotherapy which included an alkylating agent in 38. Forty five children had received a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and of these, 10 developed leukaemia as their second tumour. Of the 19 secondary leukaemias, 16 have occurred in patients treated since 1970.\n",
      "A 10-year-old boy with leukaemia-associated hypercalcaemia was treated with aminohydroxypropylidene biphosphonate (AHPrBP previously APD) in a total dosage of 60 mg over 5 days, when the condition failed to respond to rehydration and frusemide and no sustained effect was produced by haemodialysis with a calcium (Ca)-free dialysate. Bone films showed no lytic lesions, and AHPrBP, which is a potent inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption was well tolerated and induced a rapid and sustained fall in plasma Ca (from 3.42 to 2.07 mM in 5 days). Plasma magnesium and alkaline phosphatase remained normal. The results could have been affected by other drugs [vincristine, cyclophosphamide, zorubicin (Rubidazone) L-asparaginase and prednisone] which were simultaneously administered. However, the observation that: (1) the response curve of plasma Ca was similar to that reported when AHPrBP was used alone, (2) there was complete inhibition of urinary Ca excretion and (3) hypocalcaemia occurred suggests that AHPrBP was the major cause of the reduction in plasma Ca. AHPrBP should be considered a potential therapy for hypercalcaemia in childhood malignancy.\n",
      "An antigen identified by murine monoclonal antibody YB5.B8 has previously been detected only on acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) cells and tissue mast cells. We now report that the YB5.B8 antigen is present on a minor population (up to 3%) of normal bone marrow mononuclear cells which overlaps the set of progenitor cells capable of forming haemopoietic colonies in vitro. The results indicate that the antigen is a normal haemopoietic progenitor cell marker which is selectively retained on mast cells during maturation, and that leukaemias which express the antigen are not necessarily committed to the mast cell lineage. Furthermore, the antibody was capable of partially inhibiting the formation of haemopoietic colonies in vitro, indicating an important functional role for the antigen. This is consistent with the observation, reported in the accompanying paper, that expression of the YB5.B8 antigen is strongly correlated with poor response to therapy in patients with ANLL.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is required to maintain and to regulate granulocyte and monocyte productions. It is potentially useful for accelerating and enhancing haemopoietic recovery and neutrophil function. RESULTS: In acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) the dependence of blast cells on GM-CSF and its role in the development and maintenance of leukaemia are still poorly defined. In vitro exposure of fresh leukaemic blast cells to a wide range of concentrations of GM-CSF leads to a stimulation of cell proliferation in the majority of cases but does not induce any detectable maturation. CONCLUSIONS: Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor may be used in the management of ANLL and the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with the aim of: (i) accelerating the recovery of normal haemopoiesis; (ii) increasing cell killing by chemotherapy; and (iii) inducing cell maturation. Therefore the application of GM-CSF can potentially improve treatment outcome in ANLL and is worth testing in a clinical setting.\n",
      "Patients with trilineage myelodysplasia (TMDS) in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) at diagnosis and remission were clinically evaluated between 1983 and 1996. AML with TMDS (AML/TMDS) was observed in 20 (12%) of 162 patients with de novo AML at diagnosis. Complete remission (CR) was achieved with combination chemotherapy in 12 (67%) of 18 AML/TMDS cases. This CR rate was relatively worse than the rate of 78% (106/136 cases) of AML without TMDS, but this difference was not significant. Disease-free survival curves also showed no difference between AML/TMDS and AML without TMDS. During remission, eight (67%) of 12 AML/TMDS cases had myelodysplastic remission marrow (AML/MRM). AML/MRM was also seen in seven (7%) of 106 AML cases without TMDS. The actuarial disease-free survival was significantly lower in AML/MRM than in AML without MRM (P = 0.0003). All of the AML/MRM cases exhibited early leukaemic relapse; median remission duration was only 9 months. Clonal changes occurred in two cases of AML/TMDS and five cases of AML/MRM at the time of relapse. These findings suggest that TMDS during remission predicts a poorer prognosis and early leukaemic relapse when compared with the absence of TMDS.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The primary goal in management of chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is to prevent disease progression to accelerated phase (AP) or blast crisis (BC). We have evaluated progression rates in a decentralised healthcare setting and characterised patients progressing to AP/BC on TKI treatment. METHODS: Using data from the Swedish CML register, we identified CP-CML patients diagnosed 2007-2011 who progressed to AP/BC within 2 yrs from diagnosis (n = 18) as well as patients diagnosed in advanced phase during 2007-2012 (n = 36) from a total of 544 newly diagnosed CML cases. We evaluated baseline characteristics, progression rates, outcome and adherence to guidelines for monitoring and treatment. RESULTS: The cumulative progression rate at 2 yrs was 4.3%. All 18 progression cases had been treated with imatinib, and six progressed within 6 months. High-risk EUTOS score was associated to a higher risk of progression. Insufficient cytogenetic and/or molecular monitoring was found in 33%. Median survival after transformation during TKI treatment was 1.4 yrs. In those presenting with BC and AP, median survival was 1.6 yrs and not reached, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this population-based setting, progression rates appear comparable to that reported from clinical trials, with similar dismal patient outcome. Improved adherence to CML guidelines may minimise the risk of disease progression.\n",
      "A 40-year-old nulliparous woman, with a history of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), presented at a gynaecological clinic with an incidental finding of a 5 cm pelvic mass on ultrasound during workup for subfertility. Biopsies confirmed a myeloid sarcoma. The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She recovered well from her surgery, 21 months postsurgery with no evidence of recurrence.\n",
      "For a reliable incidence of a disease, all the cases that occurred in the area during the period of interest should be diagnosed, registered and classified correctly. It is very important to know in comparisons which data sources a particular cancer registry is utilizing and for how long it is waited until a publication of incidence is released. Examples from Finland show that deficits of up to 5-25% are possible in leukaemia and multiple myeloma. The populations to be compared may also have large differences in the age distribution. As the risk of all cancer, also for leukaemia and lymphomas, increases strongly by age, it is crucial that care is taken about the age adjustment before showing the incidence rates for comparisons. The age adjustment can be done using different methods and standards. In practice, the choice of methods for comparative purposes is often not crucial. It is also essential to evaluate the age-specific rates when making comparisons between populations. For cancer prevalence it would be important to know which patients can be considered cured. A population-based cancer registry does not, as a rule, have this information. However, if a cancer registry follows up the patients, survival rates of the patients may, after a number of follow-up years, start to resemble those in a comparable general population group. This is an indication that the living patients are cured and should be deducted from cancer prevalence. Advances would also be needed in statistical methods and improvement in the quality and coverage of cancer registration.\n",
      "Dasatinib (Sprycel®) is an orally administered, small molecule inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases. In the phase 3 DASISION trial, dasatinib 100 mg once daily resulted in deeper and faster cytogenetic and molecular responses than imatinib 400 mg once daily in patients with newly diagnosed, chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), although there was no significant between-group difference in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in the longer term. In the phase 3 CA180-034 trial, a regimen of dasatinib 100 mg once daily provided the most favourable benefit-risk profile in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic-phase CML. In the phase 3 CA180-035 trial, a regimen of dasatinib 140 mg once daily demonstrated efficacy in patients with accelerated- or blast-phase CML or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib had an acceptable tolerability profile. In conclusion, dasatinib is an important option for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML and for imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients with chronic- or advanced-phase CML or Ph+ ALL.\n",
      "Four patients representing a spectrum of haematological malignancies are reported. Two patients had Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative disorders, one had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and one had eosinophilic leukaemia. In each case eosinophilia was present and demonstrated to be part of the malignancy by the association of clonally abnormal metaphases with eosinophil granules. Abnormalities involving the short arm of chromosome 12 (12p13) were a constant feature in all four cases and therefore a nonrandom association between this chromosome region and malignant eosinophil proliferation is proposed.\n",
      "Translocations of the KMT2A (MLL) gene define a biologically distinct and clinically aggressive subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), marked by a characteristic gene expression profile and few cooperating mutations. Although dysregulation of the epigenetic landscape in this leukaemia is particularly interesting given the low mutation frequency, its comprehensive analysis using whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) has not been previously performed. Here we investigated epigenetic dysregulation in nine MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AML samples by comparing them to six normal myeloid controls, using a computational method that encapsulates mean DNA methylation measurements along with analyses of methylation stochasticity. We discovered a dramatically altered epigenetic profile in MLL-r AML, associated with genome-wide hypomethylation and a markedly increased DNA methylation entropy reflecting an increasingly disordered epigenome. Methylation discordance mapped to key genes and regulatory elements that included bivalent promoters and active enhancers. Genes associated with significant changes in methylation stochasticity recapitulated known MLL-r AML expression signatures, suggesting a role for the altered epigenetic landscape in the transcriptional programme initiated by MLL translocations. Accordingly, we established statistically significant associations between discordances in methylation stochasticity and gene expression in MLL-r AML, thus providing a link between the altered epigenetic landscape and the phenotype.\n",
      "Sera and leukaemic cell extracts from patients of acute leukaemia were evaluated for their effect on the repopulating ability of the pluripotent stem cells and erythroid differentiation by an in vivo splenic colony count (CFU-S) technique. Normal donor marrow cells of mice were treated with sera and cell extracts from patients of acute leukaemic and healthy controls and injected in the recipient mice. The CFU-S performed on the seventh day to assess repopulating ability of the stem cell showed consistently lower CFU-S counts in the test groups, with leukaemic sera (P less than 0.01) as well as leukaemic cell-extracts (P less than 0.001). The erythroid differentiation assessed by 59Fe uptake by the spleens also showed significantly reduced counts in the two test groups (P less than 0.01 and less than 0.001 respectively). The results indicate that both leukaemic sera and cell-extracts exert a significant suppressive effect on the repopulating ability of the stem cells and on their erythroid differentiation.\n",
      "Telomeres are the end fragments of chromosomes formed by a number of non-coding double-stranded TTAGGG repeats in vertebrates. During cell division the number of repeats decreases, leading to cell senescence or apoptosis. In immortal cells, including cancer cells, the telomere length is stable and maintained by, among other factors, telomerase. The aim of the study is to compare telomerase activity in normal lymphocytes and in leukaemic cells. Samples of acute leukaemia cells, HL 60 cell line and the lymphocytes of healthy volunteers were examined. Telomerase analysis was performed using TeloTAGGG Telomerase PCR ELISAplus (Roche). The relative telomerase activities (RTA) in leukaemic and normal cells were analysed. A high level of RTA was observed in leukaemic cells.\n",
      "Apoptosis, an active mechanism of cell death, is an important process in many biological systems. Apoptosis is thought to contribute to many disease processes. This notion has raised expectations that therapeutic opportunities will naturally follow once a better understanding of these processes has been achieved. The regulation of apoptosis in normal and malignant haematological diseases represents an important therapeutic approach in the treatment of leukaemia and lymphoma. This review summarises recent developments in the clinical manipulation of apoptosis pathways in haematological therapy.\n",
      "AIMS: To determine cause specific mortality in a cohort of 2266 chemical workers exposed to benzene in various manufacturing processes after 1935. METHODS: The cohort has accumulated over 80 000 person-years of observation; about 70% of the workers were followed for more than 30 years since first exposure. RESULTS: Mortality from non-malignant diseases of the blood was increased (SMR 2.17, 95% CI 0.87 to 4.48), and correlated with duration of benzene exposure, although risk had decreased from the previous investigation of this cohort. The risk for leukaemia was slightly above background (SMR 1.14, obs 12, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.99) but has also decreased since the earlier study of this cohort. SMRs for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL), chronic lymphatic leukaemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were 1.11, 0.42, and 1.06 respectively. There was evidence of a weak trend of increasing SMRs for leukaemia and possibly ANLL with increasing low-level cumulative exposure but not with other measures. CONCLUSION: Leukaemia and ANLL results were consistent with the mildly increased risk estimates from lower exposure subgroups of the Pliofilm cohort.\n",
      "The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors known as p15, p16 and p18 have been suggested as candidates for tumour suppressor genes. We examined these genes for their alterations in 46 myeloid leukaemias and 15 myeloid leukaemia cell lines. p16 mRNA expression was studied in 41 myeloid leukaemias. The p15 and p16 genes were either deleted or mutated in myeloid leukaemia lines at a high frequency [6/15 (40%) for p15; 8/15 (53%) for p16] but alterations in primary myeloid leukaemias are much less frequent [2/46 (4%) for p15; 3/46 (6%) for p16]. Alterations of p18 were not found in any of the samples. 13 primary myeloid leukaemia samples had negligible levels of p16 mRNA. In summary, the deletions of p15 and p16 genes identified in the myeloid leukaemia cell lines probably occurred during their in vitro immortalization. Alterations of the p16 or p15 gene only occurred in primary acute myeloid leukaemia samples that were of mixed myeloid/lymphoid lineage (CD19/CD20-positive acute myeloid leukaemia [AML], CD2/CD19-positive AML, and lymphoid blastic crisis of chronic myeloid leukaemia). Further studies are required to determine if the absence of mRNA expression results from inactivation of the p16 gene.\n",
      "For most chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients the option of a potentially 'curative' allogeneic stem cell transplant is not available because of age or lack of donor. Interferon alpha appears to extend survival when used in the chronic phase of the disease but probably does not produce long-term disease-free survivors. Autografting is being actively explored as a therapeutic option which may improve on the survival data seen with interferon and numerous different autografting methodologies are being investigated. While it seems reasonable to hope that a suitably robust and safe approach to autografting may improve survival it is unlikely with current technology that long-term disease-free survival will be achieved. To date no compelling trial data are available to confirm the efficacy of autografting but large prospective randomized studies are underway to investigate whether autografting can indeed extend survival for CML patients who do not have the option of an allograft.\n",
      "Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell CD34(+)-selected transplantation followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to maximize graft-versus-leukaemia effect while avoiding graft-versus-host disease was investigated in 22 paediatric patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 10) or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 12). Patients were grafted with a median (range) 6 x 10(6) (2-31 x 10(6))/kg CD34(+) cells and 1.1 x 10(4) (0.2-3.9 x 10(4)) CD3(+) cells. Seventy-five DLI were performed with no complications. Median time (range) to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 13 (11-15) and 12 d (8-13) respectively. Probability of relapse and disease-free survival was 23 +/- 9% and 72 +/- 6% respectively (median follow-up of 15 months).\n",
      "The role of beta-catenin in epithelial neoplasms has been widely studied whereas current knowledge regarding beta-catenin gene and protein expression in bone marrow cells derived from normal haematopoiesis and clonal haematological disorders is lacking. beta-Catenin gene expression was quantitatively investigated in bone marrow cells derived from clonal haematological disorders [acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (Ph+ CML], Ph- myeloproliferative disorders, n = 96) compared with non-neoplastic haematopoiesis (n = 33) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cellular localization of beta-catenin protein was detected by immunocytochemistry. beta-Catenin gene expression was significantly increased in AML compared with ALL cases (P < 0.0001), Ph+ CML (P < 0.0001) and non-neoplastic haematopoiesis (P = 0.019). Immunocytochemistry revealed that, in non-neoplastic haematopoiesis, the granulopoietic lineage as well as megakaryocytes showed membranous and cytoplasmic staining to various degrees along with unlabelled nuclei. Besides haematopoiesis, beta-catenin prominently marked bone marrow vascularity and diverse stroma cells. beta-Catenin gene was inversely expressed in AML and ALL with a lack of protein expression in neoplastic cells in ALL. In contrast, the other haematological disorders under study, except for Ph+ CML, did not show significant alterations of overall beta-catenin gene expression compared with normal bone marrow. These data suggest different regulatory mechanisms in the expression and function of beta-catenin in haematopoietic cells.\n",
      "The formation of the unique fusion gene, bcr-abl, and the resultant increase in abl tyrosine kinase activity, is seen as the major driving force in the initiation of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). The deregulation of abl tyrosine kinase activity, brought about by the binding of a portion of the Scr molecule to the SH2 regulatory domain of abl, appears to play a role in promoting resistance to drug-induced apoptosis. Thus the large increase In mature myeloid cells seen in CML could be the direct result of the suppression of apoptosis by the bcr-abl fusion protein. The role and contribution of apoptosis in the progression of CML and the possible role of antisense oligonucleotides to the bcr-abl gene as therapeutic agents is discussed.\n",
      "The treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has seen dramatic advances with the approval of multiple novel agents in recent years. However, unlike solid malignancies, immune checkpoint inhibitors have yet to garner regulatory approval in AML and MDS with recent randomized clinical trials yielding only underwhelming results. Novel targets have been explored in early phase clinical trials with impressive results leading to ongoing subsequent controlled trials. However, major challenges in the field remain such as the validation of predictive genetic, molecular, and immunophenotypic biomarkers, optimization of clinical trial design, and the identification of novel synergistic combination therapies. Herein, we review recent clinical trial data focusing on randomized clinical trials and highlight limitations of the currently available evidence in an effort to suggest options for advancing the field.\n",
      "Gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays represents a major advance in the diagnosis of haematological malignancies; it enables the analysis of RNA expression by clonal populations of leukaemia and lymphoma cells on a genome-wide scale. Currently, flow cytometric analysis of differentiation-linked surface antigens expressed by malignant cells is essential for the accurate diagnosis and optimal therapeutic planning for patients with leukaemias and lymphomas. Given the astonishing pace of research in microarray technology, a key question for the haematopathologist is: will gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays replace immunophenotyping, or will these two technologies evolve together as complementary approaches to improve diagnosis and therapy? In this chapter, we review the technical advantages and pitfalls of each of these two approaches and provide an assessment of their differences and potentially synergistic applications.\n",
      "Umbilical cord blood is a haematopoietic progenitor cell source for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), other haematological malignancies and metabolic diseases who can be cured by allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation, but who do not have a human leucocyte antigen compatible related or unrelated donor. Although the first cord blood transplants were done in children, there are currently more cord blood transplants performed in adults. In this review, we explore the history of umbilical cord blood transplantation, paediatric and adult outcome results, and novel trends to improve engraftment and reduce infection. Umbilical cord blood transplantation cures approximately 30-40% of adults and 60-70% of children with AML. Controversial issues, including the use of double versus single cord blood units for transplantation, optimal cord blood unit selection, infection prophylaxis, conditioning regimens and graft versus host disease prophylaxis, will be reviewed. Finally, comparison to other graft sources, cost, access to care, and the ideal graft source are discussed.\n",
      "Mutations in the nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene have been recently described to occur in about one-third of acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) and represent the most frequent genetic alteration currently known in this subset, specially in those with normal karyotype. This study explored the prevalence and clinical profile of NPM1 mutations in a cohort of 200 Indian adult and children with AML. NPM1 mutations were observed in 19.5% of all population and 34.2% of those with normal karyotype. Adults had a significantly higher incidence of NPM1 mutations than children [38 of 161 (23.6%) vs. 1 of 39 (2.5%), p = 0.002]. NPM1 mutations were significantly associated with normal karyotype (p = 0.001), high WBC count (p = 0.034), AML-M4 subtype (p = 0.039) and a gradient increase of mutation rate with the increase in age groups. Sequence analysis of 39 mutated cases revealed typical mutations (types A, B, D, Nm and H*) as well as two novel variations (types F1 and F2). Majority of the patients had mutation type A (69.2%), followed by B (5.1%), D (15.3%), H* (2.5%) and Nm (2.5%) all involving COOH terminal of the NPM1 protein. In conclusion, this study represents the first report of NPM1 mutation from Indian population and confirms that the incidence of NPM1 mutations varies considerably globally, with slightly lower incidence in Indian population compared to western countries. The current study also served to identify two novel NPM1 mutants that add new insights into the heterogeneity of genomic insertions at exon 12. More ongoing larger studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of AML that arises in this part of the world. Furthermore, we believe that in light of its high prevalence worldwide, inclusion of NPM1 mutation detection assay in diagnostic evaluations of AML may improve the efficacy of routine genetic characterization and allow assignment of patients to better-defined risk categories.\n",
      "Intensive chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for selected elderly patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We recently developed a model to predict survival, thereby providing objective information upon which to select appropriate therapy for such patients. Such models, however, must be validated on a cohort of patients not used during the development of the model. We have tested the model using a series of 61 elderly patients consecutively treated with intensive chemotherapy. Using several statistical techniques, we have shown that the model is of value in predicting prognosis, though two patients did markedly better than the model prediction. This model may be useful for predicting survival in elderly patients with AML and warrants more extensive validation.\n",
      "We compared late side effects and quality of life (QoL) in 430 survivors of childhood acute leukaemia based on whether they had undergone haematopoietic cell transplantation (n=142) or not (n=288). Mean age was 18.2 years and mean follow-up duration was 11.9 years. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare the risk of each type of late effect in the two groups. Based on age, VSP-A or SF36 questionnaires were used to assess QoL. For each QoL dimension, multiple linear regression was done to construct models of association with the treatment group. Transplanted patients experienced more side effects, including height growth failure, gonadal dysfunction, hypothyroidism and cataract. Children and adolescents in the two treatment groups reported similar QoL levels for almost all dimensions except a better perception of school work by young transplanted children and more difficulties in relating to the medical staff for transplanted adolescents. In adults, two differences in physical domain of QoL were detected but the calculated effect sizes were less than 0.2 in each case, suggesting an uncertain clinical significance. In spite of a higher risk of physical adverse events in the transplanted group, very few clinically significant differences in QoL are detectable.\n",
      "In view of the genetic heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), gene expression profiling (GEP) with the possibility of investigating the expression of tens of thousands of genes in parallel represents a promising approach to facilitate and improve the diagnostic process in this complex disorder. In the last decade, following the introduction of this methodology in leukaemia research, various studies have demonstrated that classification of the majority of known genetic subclasses in AML can be performed with high accuracy by GEP. Further, GEP allowed for detecting new biologically and prognostically relevant subclasses within the defined subgroups, mainly in the normal karyotype AML. These new classifiers cross the borders of traditionally defined prognostic parameters, and some of these gene expression signatures were independently validated by different study groups. The development of treatment-specific sensitivity assays being able to predict the individual patient response to targeted therapy is another interesting perspective. With respect to molecular mutations in genes such as FLT3 or NPM1, future studies must outline the definite position of GEP. International multicentre studies such as the MILE study (Microarray Innovations in LEukemia) pave the way to a standardised workflow of GEP in routine diagnostics in AML.\n",
      "Peripheral blood levels of BFU-e, CFU-GM and CFU-mix were studied serially in nine patients with acute leukaemia in remission during the period of recovery that followed induction or consolidation chemotherapy. Following 23 courses of treatment in the nine patients, the values for all three classes of progenitor were found to be higher in ALL than in AML (mean peak CFU-GM levels 5.8 x 10(3)/ml and 0.8 x 10(3)/ml respectively) and the highest levels were observed in patients recovering the most rapidly from bone marrow aplasia. Peak levels of these progenitors correlated best with the rate and extent of platelet recovery and all patients achieving blood levels of greater than 1.0 x 10(3) CFU-GM/ml had recovered greater than 100 x 10(9)/l platelets by 20 d and had peak platelet counts of greater than 400 x 10(9)/l within 40 d following chemotherapy. The peak values for circulating progenitors fell markedly after repeated courses of treatment in three of the five AML patients studied and this is likely to limit useful harvesting of such cells during later consolidation courses in this disease.\n",
      "The descriptive epidemiology of hairy cell leukaemia is reported from a specialized register of haematological malignancies covering approximately one-third of England and Wales. The overall incidence of hairy cell leukaemia at 2.9 per million persons per year is similar to that recorded in America. There is a marked male preponderance (4.0 compared with 1.7 per million per year for females). A case-control study on hairy cell leukaemia was conducted in the Yorkshire and Trent Regional Health Authority areas. 50 cases and 95 controls were identified, and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Previous results on the aetiology of hairy cell leukaemia were not supported by this study, with the exception of an association between hairy cell leukaemia and exposure to organic solvents, petrochemicals and related products.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: We previously reported that children exposed to elevated extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) had a five to six times higher risk of leukaemia, central nervous system (CNS) tumour and malignant lymphoma. Here we extend the study from 1968 to 1986 through 2003. METHODS: We included 3277 children with leukaemia, CNS tumour or malignant lymphoma during 1968-2003 recorded in the Danish Cancer Registry and 9129 controls randomly selected from the Danish childhood population. ELF-MF from 50 to 400 kV facilities were calculated at the residences. RESULTS: For recently diagnosed cases (1987-2003), the relative risk (RR) was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32-2.42), while for the total period (1968-2003) it was 1.63 (95% CI: 0.77-3.46) for leukaemia, CNS tumour and malignant lymphoma combined for exposures ⩾0.4 μT compared with <0.1 μT. These results were based on five cases (recent period) and 11 cases (total period) in the highest exposure group. CONCLUSIONS: We did not confirm the previous finding of a five- to six-fold higher risk for leukaemia, CNS tumour and malignant lymphoma when including data from the more recent time period. For the total time period, the results for childhood leukaemia were in line with large pooled analyses showing RRs between 1.5 and 2.\n",
      "The French National Registry of Childhood Leukaemia and Lymphoma (NRCL) covers the whole French mainland population aged less than 15 years (approximately 11 million children) for all childhood haematopoietic tumours since 1 January 1990, except Hodgkin disease, which has been registered since 1 January 1999. During the period from 1990 to 1999, 5757 cases of leukaemia, lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndrome were registered in the NRCL, with an average of 2.5 sources per case. The age-standardized incidence rates per million per year were 43.1 for leukaemia (34.3 for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 7.1 for acute myeloblastic leukaemia, 0.6 for chronic myeloid leukaemia and 0.5 for chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia), 8.9 for non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 6.7 for Hodgkin disease. Down syndrome was present in 110 cases of acute leukaemia (2.5%) and three cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.3%). The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia showed a typical peak at age 2 years for girls and 3 years for boys. The incidence rates of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma did not show any temporal trends over the 10 year period.\n",
      "A chloroma is described in the left quadrant of the maxilla in a 4-year-old girl. This patient had previously completed a course of chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia, but had been off all drug therapy and in remission for 1 year prior to presentation. Chloroma is a well recognised, if uncommon, mode of presentation of acute myeloblastic leukaemia and a previous case of chloroma occurring in the mandibular gingival tissues has been reported (Reichart et al., 1984). An unusual feature in the present case is the appearance of the chloroma as a form of leukaemic relapse and as a solitary deposit which is itself uncommon in acute myeloblastic leukaemia. It is suggested that this chloroma was a leukaemic deposit which had spread from within the maxillary antrum or the tissues adjacent to the meninges.\n",
      "Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is applied to consolidate first remission in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, outcome after ASCT widely varies among AML patients. We analyzed the prognostic significance of haematological recovery for neutrophils [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1·0 × 10(9) /l] and platelets (platelet count >20·0 × 10(9) /l), stratifying at day 20 after ASCT in 88 consecutive and homogeneously treated AML patients in first remission. We observed that patients with delayed recovery had better overall survival (OS; ANC: P < 0·0001 and platelets: P = 0·0062) and time to progression (TTP; ANC: P = 0·0003 and platelets: P = 0·0125). Delayed recovery was an independent marker for better OS and TTP in a multivariate analysis including age, gender, number of transfused CD34+ cells, cytogenetics, FLT3-internal tandem duplication and NPM1 mutation. Our results suggest that delayed neutrophil and platelet recovery is associated with longer OS and TTP in AML patients consolidated with ASCT in first remission.\n",
      "A case of juvenile chronic myelogenous leukaemia is presented. The clinical and haematological responses to courses of cytosine arabinoside, 6-mercaptopurine and prednisolone are described. Although there was some satisfactory response to the treatment and remission lasting over an unusually long period of time, the patient died of a rapidly progressive hypersplenism with severe sequestration of transfused blood and platelets. The nonaggressive and easily administered regimen of drugs described here is recommended for children with this disease where bone marrow transplant facilities are unavailable.\n",
      "While the understanding of the genomic aberrations that underpin chronic and acute myeloid leukaemia (CML and AML) has allowed the development of therapies for these diseases, limitations remain. These become apparent when looking at the frequency of treatment resistance leading to disease relapse in leukaemia patients. Key questions regarding the fundamental biology of the leukaemic cells, such as their metabolic dependencies, are still unresolved. Even though a majority of leukaemic cells are killed during initial treatment, persistent leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) and therapy-resistant cells are still not eradicated with current treatments, due to various mechanisms that may contribute to therapy resistance, including cellular metabolic adaptations. In fact, recent studies have shown that LSCs and treatment-resistant cells are dependent on mitochondrial metabolism, hence rendering them sensitive to inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). As a result, rewired energy metabolism in leukaemic cells is now considered an attractive therapeutic target and the significance of this process is increasingly being recognised in various haematological malignancies. Therefore, identifying and targeting aberrant metabolism in drug-resistant leukaemic cells is an imperative and a relevant strategy for the development of new therapeutic options in leukaemia. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the most recent studies that present experimental evidence on how leukaemic cells can metabolically rewire, more specifically the importance of OXPHOS in LSCs and treatment-resistant cells, and the current drugs available to target this process. We highlight that uncovering specific energy metabolism dependencies will guide the identification of new and more targeted therapeutic strategies for myeloid leukaemia.\n",
      "The BCR/ABL rearrangement, the molecular hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), is rare in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), being detected in approximately 1% of cases. In the vast majority of CML cases the breakpoint on chromosome 22 falls in the so-called major breakpoint cluster region of the BCR gene. Only a few cases of CML with breakpoint in the minor or in the micro bcr region have so far been reported. The micro breakpoint position has been associated mainly with a mild form of CML, defined as Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (Ph-positive CNL). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we report a patient with an acute myeloid leukaemia phenotype at diagnosis who showed a BCR/ABL rearrangement with a breakpoint located in the micro bcr region (e19a2 junction). Cytogenetic analysis showed a progression of the malignant clone, finally leading to cells with two Ph chromosomes, trisomy 8, isochromosome 17q and deletion of the long arms of chromosome 7. The findings of chromosomal changes point to a possibility of blast crisis of CML with a clinically silent chronic phase. Immunoprecipitation and auto-phosphorylation assay revealed the expression, by the patient blast cells, of an abnormal P230 BCR/ABL protein, which showed for the first time that this protein was constitutively activated in primary cells from patients. This finding may contribute to the understanding of the role of the BCR/ABL rearrangements in determining different leukaemia phenotypes ranging from acute lymphoid and myeloid leukaemias to mild chronic neutrophilic leukaemias.\n",
      "Loss of the Y chromosome with a resulting 45, X0 karyotype is observed in normal bone marrow cells of elderly males but also in haematological malignancies. Whether Y loss in neoplastic cells is related to the process seen in normal ageing or is part of the carcinogenic process is unknown. The present study concerns the cytogenetic data from 1907 consecutive leukaemic or preleukaemic male patients with special regard to the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. Sixty-five patients (3.4%) had a 45, X-Y clone in their bone marrow (BM) cells. Loss of Y was rare below the age of 50 but increased in older patients, reaching 25% of the men over 80. Sixteen patients (0.08%) had more than 90% X0 cells in their BM. A correlation between Y loss and leukaemia could be established in seven cases, three of which were acute myeloid leukaemia M2 subtype where -Y is known to be a secondary event. In three other cases, -Y was part of a complex karyotype. Only one patient exhibited a 45, X0 karyotype, with no other rearrangement, that could be positively correlated with the neoplastic process.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Therapy related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) is a distinct clinical entity recognized by the World Health Organization classification occurring after chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment administered for a previous disease. T-AML is characterised by pancytopenia, three-lineage myelodysplasia, high frequency of unfavourable cytogenetics and short survival. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse clinical, cytogenetic, and cytological characteristics of t-AML and their impact on survival. METHODS: Seventeen patients with t-AML (8 male and 9 female; median age 59 years) were identified among 730 consecutive patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. The degree of three-lineage dysplasia as well as haematological, cytological and cytogenetic analyses, were assessed by standard methods. RESULTS: The patients survived a median of 62.5 days with the 10% probability of survival during two years. Prognostically favourable factors were a higher percentage of dysplastic granulocytic cells, age less than 60 years, and presence of prognostically favourable karyotype inv(16), t(15;17), t(8;21). CONCLUSION: The stated prognostic factors that include age, cytogenetics findings and granulocytic dysplasia analysis could contribute to adequate risk stratification of t-AML, though fuller results would require additional analyses.\n",
      "A patient whose leukaemic cells carried the rare t(7;11)(p15;p15) was diagnosed as having acute myelomonocytic leukaemia (AML-M4), and supports the association of this specific translocation with forms of acute myeloid leukaemia showing differentiation. Blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia was excluded by lack of involvement of the ABL and BCR genes. Chromosome in situ hybridization studies showed that both the HRAS1 and INS genes were present on the terminal part of chromosome 11p which was translocated to chromosome 7p. Neither HRAS1 nor INS were structurally rearranged. Field inversion gel electrophoresis showed that a 400 kb fragment encompassing HRAS1 was structurally entire in leukaemic DNA. Because the INS gene, which was also translocated, is probably located proximal to HRAS1 on chromosome 11p, it is unlikely that HRAS1 was near the chromosome 11 breakpoint or involved in this leukaemia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression levels of GPX1, SOCS5 and IL7 and their clinical significance in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China, from January 2013 to November 2020. METHODOLOGY: Based on the bioinformatics analysis, the expression levels of GPX1, SOCS5 and IL7 in the bone marrow of 64 AML patients (non-M3) and 32 healthy individuals were evaluated by real-time PCR. Correlation between GPX1 expression and the clinical characteristics, response to induced chemotherapy, and survival time of AML patients were analysed as the outcome measure. RESULTS: GPX1 was significantly downregulated in AML patients, which helped in distinguishing AML patients from normal controls. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) was 0.741 (p <0.001). Additionally, GPX1 expression was correlated with gender (r = -0.250, p = 0.045), FAB classification (r = -0.332,  p = 0.004), and chemotherapy response (r = 0.366, p = 0.003). AML patients with high GPX1 expression levels had a lower rate of remission (p = 0.021) and poor long-term survival (p = 0.036) than those with low GPX1 expression levels. CONCLUSION: Low GPX1 expression in AML patients may be closely associated with the pathogenesis and chemoresistance of AML. Key Words: Acute myeloid leukaemia, Clinical outcome, Gene expression, GPX1.\n",
      "Multidrug resistance represents an important mechanism by which leukaemic and solid tumour cells escape cell death after exposure to anthracyclines and other natural products. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) associated with the inversion chromosome 16: inv(16)(p13q22) has a favourable prognosis and is known to be chemosensitive. The inversion chromosome is seen in a number of FAB subclasses but is most commonly associated with acute myelomonocytic leukaemia with abnormal eosinophils, M4Eo. It results in the creation of a fusion between the myosin heavy chain gene (MYH11) on the short arm and the gene for a transcription factor, core binding factor beta (CBFB) on the long arm. In a subset of these inv(16) AML patients, inversion also results in loss of the gene for the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) at the short arm breakpoint. This gene maps to 16p13.13, centromeric to the primary short arm breakpoint, separated from MYH11 by a distance of approximately 150kb. Deletion of the MRP gene has been demonstrated by in situ hybridisation, gene dosage studies and by loss of heterozygosity of a flanking microsatellite marker (D16S405). Twenty two patients with inv(16) leukaemia were analysed for deletion of the MRP gene. Deletion of the gene was detected in seven patients, fourteen patients showed retention of the gene and in one case the findings were indeterminate. Clinical data from 13 of these patients were analysed revealing deletion of the MRP gene to be significantly associated with longer time from diagnosis until failure (death or relapse from complete remission) in these patients (p = 0.007). From this work and the growing literature concerning MRP, it appears likely that the deletion of an MRP allele, may favourably affect the biology of inv(16) AML and may have important prognostic implications.\n",
      "In ninety-three cases of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) we investigated the importance to short- and long term clinical outcome of the in vitro short term leukaemia cell survival as measured by a 4-day MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide)-assay. In 67 patients treated by intravenous remission induction therapy we found that patients who after the first induction cycle or after induction therapy overall achieved a complete remission (CR) had leukaemia cells with significantly lower in vitro cell survival ability than cells of non-responders (p = 0.02 and 0.06, respectively). These relations remained statistically significant in subsequent multivariate analyses. Likewise, a favourable effect of low in vitro leukaemia cell survival on overall survival of the patients was detected in the (largest) subgroup of adult patients treated uniformly by the same remission induction regimen as well as in all patients. However, in the 44 patients, who achieved CR, the in vitro leukaemia cell survival did not show significance to remission duration or time to first relapse. Furthermore, the leukaemia cell survival (MTT-assay) did not to correlate with the Bcl-2 expression level (quantitative flow cytometry) of the leukaemia cells (r = 0.18, n = 34, p = 0.32). In addition, in a cell line model employing the growth factor dependent MO7 human AML cell line, growth factor withdrawal was associated with rapid onset of cellular apoptosis as evaluated by morphology, occurrence of a subG1 peak in DNA histograms, and loss of cellular activity in the MTT-assay. In contrast, a more moderate decline in Bcl-2 expression and gradual loss of ability to exclude the trypan blue dye was seen in the leukaemia cells in response to growth factor withdrawal. We conclude, that the MTT-assay provides a simple and sensitive method for measuring in vitro cell survival. The differences in leukaemia cell survival seen in AML may well be clinically relevant and may help to provide a better understanding of clinical drug resistance.\n",
      "Immunocytochemistry was used to assess bcl-2 expression in blasts obtained from the bone marrow of 28 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (16 children and six adults at presentation and three children and three adults on relapse) and 20 with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (19 adults and one child, 13 with de novo AML, 11 at presentation and two on relapse, and seven secondary to myelodysplasia or chronic myeloid leukaemia). Slides were examined both for the percentage of positive cells and for the intensity of staining using a five-point scale. There was a statistically significant increase in both the percentage of positive cells seen (P < 0.002) and the intensity of staining (P < 0.01) between samples obtained at relapse and those at presentation in ALL. There was a significantly greater intensity of staining in cells from patients with ALL (P < 0.05) and AML (P < 0.05) who failed to achieve remission after chemotherapy than in those who responded. The intensity of staining in cases of secondary AML was lower than that in de novo disease (P < 0.01). These results suggest that expression of bcl-2 may be an important prognostic feature in both de novo AML and in ALL, but not in secondary AML.\n",
      "Intensive multi-agent chemotherapy regimens and the introduction of risk-stratified therapy have substantially improved cure rates for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Current risk allocation schemas are imperfect, as some children are classified as lower-risk and treated with less intensive therapy relapse, while others deemed higher-risk are probably over-treated. Most cooperative groups previously used morphological clearance of blasts in blood and marrow during the initial phases of chemotherapy as a primary factor for risk group allocation; however, this has largely been replaced by the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). Other than age and white blood cell count (WBC) at presentation, many clinical variables previously used for risk group allocation are no longer prognostic, as MRD and the presence of sentinel genetic lesions are more reliable at predicting outcome. Currently, a number of sentinel genetic lesions are used by most cooperative groups for risk stratification; however, in the near future patients will probably be risk-stratified using genomic signatures and clustering algorithms, rather than individual genetic alterations. This review will describe the clinical, biological, and response-based features known to predict relapse risk in childhood ALL, including those currently used and those likely to be used in the near future to risk-stratify therapy.\n",
      "A seven-year-old crossbred male dog with a suspected leukaemic condition was referred for investigation and treatment. A bone marrow aspirate revealed an acute myeloid leukaemia. Combination chemotherapy was administered and the dog initially improved, but 18 days after the initiation of therapy its body condition deteriorated and the animal developed acute respiratory distress. On postmortem examination, extensive leukaemic pulmonary infiltrates were evident.\n",
      "The frequency of occurrence of malignant neoplasms in the cases of pyoderma gangrenosum is not exactly determined, but it can be assessed to be at 7%. The aim of the study was to report a 26-year-old male patient with pyoderma gangrenosum coexisting with acute myelogenous leukaemia. The first skin lesions on both tibia occurred in June 2001. Prior to the proper diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum, the patient was treated surgically. Because of the dramatic dermatological and general condition in November 2001, the patient was admitted to the Dermatological Department of the Silesian Medical Academy in Katowice where the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum was established. On the clinical and biochemical picture, the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum within acute myelogenous leukaemia was made. Initially, cyclosporin A 200 mg orally per day in the therapy of pyoderma gangrenosum was administered to achieve a slight clinical improvement. Although chemotherapy leukaemia was performed, the patient died after 4 months of the confirmation of the acute myelogenous leukaemia diagnosis.\n",
      "In the group of high risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), very early and early relapses have a very poor prognosis with conventional chemotherapy alone. Remission induction in these patients is often hindered by drug resistance. Thus, intensifying chemotherapy strategies are required. Application of hyperthermia enhances efficacy of certain anti-neoplastic drugs such as ifosfamide. In this study, effects and molecular mechanisms of ifosfamide - and hyperthermia-induced apoptosis are investigated in a B cell precursor leukaemia cell line (REH) and in primary patient-derived B cell progenitor leukaemic blasts. Both 4OOH-IFA and hyperthermia are able to induce cell death in leukaemic cells, mainly by induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. However, completely different kinetics of caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation are found for both stimuli. In addition, activation of caspase-1 is only observed following stimulation with hyperthermia. Combined application of ifosfamide and hyperthermia reveals increased cytotoxicity in both the leukaemia cell line and in 5/8 of the patient-derived leukaemic blast samples. In conclusion, hyperthermia and ifosfamide mediate cytotoxicity in B precursor leukaemic blasts by different kinetics of caspase activation. This might explain the additive effects of 4OOH-IFA and heat on leukaemic cell death. Therefore, whole body thermochemotherapy could be considered as a treatment option in relapsed leukaemic patients.\n",
      "Internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene is a gain-of-function mutation common in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). It is associated with inferior prognosis and response to chemotherapy. Single base mutations at the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) also leads to a gain of function, although its prognostic significance is less well defined because of its rarity. The clinical benefits of FLT3 inhibition are generally limited to AML with FLT3-ITD. However, responses are transient and leukaemia progression invariably occurs. There is compelling evidence that leukaemia clones carrying both ITD and TKD mutations appear when resistance to FLT3 inhibitors occurs. Interestingly, the emergence of double ITD and TKD mutants can be recapitulated in vitro when FLT3-ITD+ leukaemia cell lines are treated with mutagens and FLT3 inhibitors. Furthermore, murine xenotransplantation models also suggest that, in some cases, the FTL3-ITD and TKD double mutants actually exist in minute amounts before treatment with FLT3 inhibitors, expand under the selection pressure of FLT3 inhibition and become the predominant resistant clone(s) during the drug-refractory phase. On the basis of this model of clonal evolution, a multipronged strategy using more potent FLT3 inhibitors, and a combinatorial approach targeting both FLT3-dependent and FLT3-independent pathways, will be needed to improve outcome.\n",
      "Histopathological findings in the liver in a series of autopsies on 110 patients suffering from leukaemia or lymphoma were reviewed. No treatment had been given to 23 patients, 50 had received chemotherapy alone, 23 chemo- and radiotherapy and 14 underwent bone marrow transplantation. The 23 untreated patients showed neoplastic infiltration in 10 (44%) and fibrosis in 16 cases (70%). The 14 bone marrow recipients showed mainly acute necrosis, zonal in six (43%) and focal in one (7%), and cholestasis in five (36%), together with marked siderosis in 11 (79%). Patients receiving chemotherapy or chemo-/radiotherapy showed similar changes consisting of neoplastic infiltration in 14 (28%) and in five (22%) cases respectively, and fibrosis in 31 (62%) and 17 (74%) cases respectively. Steatosis was seen in 70% of cases in the chemo-/radiotherapy group and in 50% of cases in the other groups. Infections were seen in all groups, particularly in the chemotherapy group (four fungal and two bacterial including one tuberculosis) and in the chemo-/radiotherapy group (one fungal and one bacterial). Cytomegalovirus infection was seen only in the bone marrow transplant group.\n",
      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Relapse of haematological neoplasms after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains one of the leading causes of death. Treatment of relapse post-HSCT is frequently ineffective and outcomes are poor, necessitating preventive strategies that are reviewed below. RECENT FINDINGS: Current strategies to prevent relapse after HSCT are geared towards four general principles: improving the antitumour effects of conditioning regimens prior to HSCT, improving graft selection and engineering to augment the graft-versus-leukaemia effect, post-HSCT chemotherapeutic interventions to impair growth of residual clonal cells and post-HSCT immune-mediated interventions to enhance the graft-versus-leukaemia effect. Strategies based on cell manipulation, namely natural killer (NK) cell enrichment and adoptive T cell transfer, are emerging. Targeted therapies including vaccinations, FLT3 inhibitors, mAbs and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy represent a new avenue of treating acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Studies are underway to incorporate all of these strategies in the clinical setting to determine their impact on relapse and survival after HSCT. SUMMARY: The most recent evidence suggests that strategies using NK cell therapy and targeted immune therapies after HSCT may change the current landscape of HSCT for AML and MDS.\n",
      "Gilteritinib (Xospata®), a next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is approved in several countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adults with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations. In this patient population, oral gilteritinib significantly improved overall survival (OS) and the response rate for complete remission with full or partial haematological recovery compared with salvage chemotherapy in the phase III ADMIRAL trial. In an integrated safety analysis of patients with relapsed or refractory AML, the most commonly reported grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) in gilteritinib recipients included anaemia, febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Clinically relevant AEs of special interest (AESIs) with gilteritinib therapy included differentiation syndrome, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, QT interval prolongation and pancreatitis. AEs, including AESIs, were generally manageable with dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation. All patients of reproductive potential should use contraception during gilteritinib treatment due to the risk of embryo-foetal toxicity. Given its convenient oral regimen, along with the poor prognosis and paucity of treatment options for adults with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML, gilteritinib represents a valuable first-line targeted monotherapy in these patients.\n",
      "A 78-year-old woman with acute myelogenic leukaemia (AML M5 (FAB)) was treated with standard induction chemotherapy followed by recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) (250 micrograms/m2/day) in an effort to accelerate neutrophil recovery. After 10 days of rhGM-CSF therapy, increasing numbers of promonocytes and monocytes were detected in the peripheral blood, with a maximum total white blood count of 14,900/microliters of which 39% were promonocytes, 39% monocytes, and only 3% neutrophils. The bone marrow during GM-CSF therapy was hypercellular and contained 95% monocytic forms. After discontinuation of rhGM-CSF, this monocyte lineage stimulation was completely reversible. Without further chemotherapy the patient entered a complete remission after 9 months and is now relapse free after 24 months. Since the stimulation was restricted to the previously leukaemic lineage of this patient, the profound monocytosis observed in this case suggests the possibility that GM-CSF may exert reversible effects on the proliferation of clonogenic cells in acute monocytic leukaemia.\n",
      "Activation of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway has been linked with resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, and its downregulation, by means of PI3K inhibitors, lowers resistance to various types of therapy in tumour cell lines. Recently, it has been reported that deguelin, a naturally occurring rotenoid, is a powerful inhibitor of PI3K. We investigated whether or not deguelin could enhance the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs of human U937 leukaemia cells and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts with an activated PI3K/Akt network. Deguelin (10 nmol/l) induced S phase arrest with interference of progression to G2/M, and at 100 nmol/l significantly increased apoptotic cell death of U937. At 10-100 nmol/l concentrations, deguelin downregulated Akt phosphorylation of leukaemia cells and markedly increased sensitivity of U937 cells to etoposide or cytarabine. A 10 nmol/l concentration of deguelin did not negatively affect the survival rate of human cord blood CD34+ cells, whereas it increased sensitivity of AML blasts to cytarabine. Deguelin was less toxic than wortmannin on erythropoietin- and stem cell factor-induced erythropoiesis from CD34+ progenitor cells. Overall, our results indicate that deguelin might be used in the future for increasing sensitivity to therapeutic treatments of leukaemia cells with an active PI3K/Akt signalling network.\n",
      "Now that a substantial group of cancer patients has such a favourable prognosis, it has become increasingly important to evaluate the long-term complications of treatment. Of all late effects of treatment, secondary leukaemia is one of the most serious. Increased risk of AML has been observed both after RT and after CT; however, several types of CT have much stronger leukaemogenic properties than RT. Limited field radiation in the therapeutic dose range is associated with very little or no increased risk of leukaemia, which has been attributed to cell killing at the higher radiation doses. With respect to CT, two different syndromes of treatment-related AML have been recognized. Risk of alkylating agent-related AML is highest in the 5-10 year follow-up period and seems to decrease afterwards. This type of leukaemia is often preceded by MDS, and is characterized by deletions of chromosomes 5 and 7. Leukaemias related to treatment with the topoisomerase II inhibitors are characterized by a short induction period, presentation as myelomonocytic or monocytic leukaemia (rather than MDS) and balanced chromosomal translocations involving bands 11q23 and 21q22. This review addresses the risk of secondary AML and MDS following treatment of HD, NHL, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and paediatric malignancies. In patients with HD, the risk of AML is higher with an increasing number of mechlorethamine-procarbazine-containing cycles, a greater number of CT episodes, and after splenectomy. The majority of data shows that RT does not add to the leukaemia risk from CT, but this issue is still surrounded by some controversy. ABV(D)-treated patients have a very low risk of AML. Generally, patients with NHL, testicular cancer and breast cancer experience much lower risk of AML than patients with HD. NHL and breast cancer treatment regimens with cumulative cyclophosphamide doses of 20 g or less do not confer an appreciable increase of AML. Recently, strongly increased AML risk has been observed following autologous bone marrow transplantation and other dose intensification strategies. Risk factors for this excess remain to be defined. PVB treatment for testicular cancer is not followed by increased leukaemia risk, but modern etoposide-containing regimens do confer excess risk, of which the magnitude at conventional drug doses is not yet well known. High risk of leukaemia has been reported in children treated with epipodophyllotoxins. The leukaemogenic hazards of cancer treatment should be weighed against their therapeutic benefits.\n",
      "The graft-versus-leukaemia effect is one of the most important biological effects to influence outcome in patients with acute leukaemia. The recognition of this modality over the past three decades has led to far-reaching changes in the concept and conduct of allogeneic transplantation in acute myeloid leukaemia, and in the infusion of donor lymphocytes as a therapeutic modality. Despite these conceptual advances, there is a considerable need for more structured prospective studies to optimally define the role of reduced-intensity transplantation in both acute myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n",
      "We developed a real-time RT-PCR assay for the quantification of topoisomerase II (topo II) mRNA level. It was applied on peripheral leukaemic cells from 23 patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and 23 with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). RNA template dilutions from 0.25 to 25ng per reaction were used as standard curves for topo IIalpha, beta and the internal control 18S rRNA. About 57% (26/46) and 26% (12/46) of the specimens had detectable topo IIbeta and alpha mRNA, respectively. The correlation between these two factors was rho=0.7 and P=0.0001. No relationship between topo IIalpha or beta mRNA level and response to chemotherapy was found in AML patients (n=19 assessable for response). Our method is rapid and convenient for quantification of topo IIalpha and beta mRNA levels, and could be suitable for investigation in a larger population.\n",
      "We have analysed the frequency of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) in cohorts of patients from Turkey with acute lymphocyte leukaemia (n = 52), acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 54) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) (n = 52) and compared the results with 154 controls. We also examined the frequencies of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-C groups, -Bw4, -Bw6 and where appropriate the combination of the KIR gene and its ligand. We found several statistically significant results between the patients and the controls. We proposed a model in CML of protection via KIR2DL2 and/or KIR2DS2 with the presence of the ligand HLA-C1 group and susceptibility via HLA-Bw4 homozygosity (i.e. absence of HLA-Bw6).\n",
      "A 34-year-old woman, in remission from acute myeloid leukaemia, had a positive postnatal Kleihauer result. Following our standard local protocol for positive Kleihauer tests in Rh-D negative patients, the specimen was referred for confirmatory testing, which proved the result to be false positive. Hereditary persistence of foetal haemoglobin was excluded as a Kleihauer test performed in a pregnancy prior to the development of leukaemia was negative. Further testing confirmed mild elevation of foetal haemoglobin (HbF) and increased F-cells. Elevated-HbF levels have been widely reported in patients with haematological malignancy. In this case, the patient was confirmed to be in a true molecular remission from leukaemia and yet appeared to have a residual clonal population of HbF erythrocytes; the significance of this finding remains unclear. This case also highlights the importance of confirmatory testing of suspected foeto-maternal haemorrhage, as not all positive Kleihauer tests are true positives.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in cancer treatments is widespread with substantial number of patients deserting conventional cancer therapies in favour of unproven methods. The present study aimed at discovering the prevalence of use of CAM cancer therapies in leukaemia patients visiting haematology clinic of a north Indian tertiary care hospital. METHODS: 533 consecutive leukaemia patients were interviewed. Information was gathered about patients' demographics, types of CAM taken, sequence of seeking CAM and conventional medicine, sources of recommendation, reasons of opting for CAM, and areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction associated with the use of CAM. Patients were also asked if they had informed their doctor about CAM use. RESULTS: Prevalence of CAM use in leukaemia patients was found to be 56.6%. Ayurveda was the most commonly used CAM (33%). Most of the patients sought conventional medicine first, followed by CAM therapies. Fifty-two percent of the patients opted for CAM hoping for a miracle cure and 51% were dissatisfied with these therapies. Family members and neighbours constituted major source of recommendation of CAM therapy. Only 3.8% of the patients had informed their doctors about CAM use. CONCLUSION: A sizeable percentage of patients receiving conventional treatment for leukaemia also use CAM therapies. Clinicians should not underestimate the value of hopeful attitude in their management of leukaemia patients and ought to be conversant with popular forms of CAM cancer therapies.\n"

      "We report three pregnancies with successful outcomes in two women following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for acute leukaemia using high dose melphalan alone as conditioning therapy. The increasing application and success of BMT together with the instigation of conditioning regimens that do not include total body irradiation should increase such cases. These and previous cases document that a normal outcome of pregnancy is likely in these patients.\n",
      "We studied the kinetics of EBV-transformed B-cell lines from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) using RT-PCR for BCR-ABL transcripts and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, obtained from four patients with CML in chronic phase and from one in accelerated phase, were incubated with supernatant from the B95-8 EBV producing cell line. In 11/25 (44%) B-cell cultures established we demonstrated the presence of BCR-ABL transcripts at intervals ranging from 32 to 125 d post EBV transformation. In all but two cases, evidence of BCR-ABL transcripts disappeared with time. Cultures were initially polyclonal with respect to IgH rearrangements but became progressively oligoclonal, suggesting the longer-term survival of fewer clones, all of which were BCR-ABL negative. We conclude that BCR-ABL-positive lymphoid cultures can be established in the short term from the majority of patients with CML but they have limited capacity to survive in the longer term. Therefore, in lymphoid cells the presence of the BCR-ABL chimaeric gene appears to confer no survival advantage.\n",
      "The majority of radiation-induced murine myeloid leukaemias are characterized by deletion and/or translocation of an interstitial region of chromosome 2, and there is evidence that such events may occur very early in myeloid leukaemogenesis. Analyses presented and discussed here on the structure and function of two possibly relevant chromosome 2 encoded genes (c-abl and beta 2M) lead to the preliminary conclusion that neither are directly involved nor activationally changed by the characteristic chromosome 2 rearrangements.\n",
      "Classical serological methods and Southern blot hybridization for the diagnosis of bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) infection have been compared during the first nine months of life of offspring from BLV serum-negative and serum-positive dams belonging to a Friesian dairy herd in Italy. At birth, 9/13 calves analysed showed serum positivity for anti-gp60 BLV antibodies by agar immunodiffusion and/or by ELISA. However, only two calves were positive for BLV integrated proviruses in their lymphocyte DNA. At six months of age, anti-gp60 BLV antibodies and proviral DNA positivities were simultaneously shown only by the two cattle identified as DNA-positive at birth. This pattern remained constant up to nine months of age. Furthermore, analysis of the molecular characteristics of BLV integrated proviruses, carried out by using, as probes, the almost complete proviral genome (Belgian isolate) or a subclone of the env gene radioactively labelled or chemically modified, revealed that the calves under study were infected by a different isolate (Japanese isolate) and that, in one of the cattle, the majority of integrated proviruses was characterized by deletions probably located in the 5' half of the proviral genome.\n",
      "Hairy-cell leukaemia (HCL) is an uncommon B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorder that accounts for about 2% of all leukaemias. Although the disease is generally indolent in its natural course, the majority of patients require treatment for life-threatening infections due to pancytopenia or symptomatic splenomegaly. During the past 20 years, remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of HCL. Since the introduction of interferon-alpha, splenectomy, which was formerly the standard therapy, has been rarely used. With the purine analogues cladribine and pentostatin, response rates are even better than with interferon-alpha and long-lasting remissions can be achieved in most patients. Therefore, these agents are now considered the treatment of choice. Recently, immunotherapeutic approaches which use monoclonal antibodies have increased the number of therapeutic options for HCL and offer promising salvage strategies for patients who relapse or who are refractory to treatment with purine analogues. In this review the different treatment options available are discussed and recommendations for the clinical management of the HCL are summarised.\n",
      "All types of leukaemia can disseminate to the skin, producing cutaneous deposits known as leukaemia cutis (LC). We undertook a retrospective study to review the clinical presentations, treatment and outcome of eight patients with LC managed in our department over a period of 12 years. The clinical phenotype varied, with erythematous papules and nodules occurring with greatest frequency. Infiltrated haemorrhagic plaques and perifollicular acneiform papules were also seen. Although patients were treated aggressively for their underlying leukaemia, and received therapy directed towards LC, they tended to be refractory to treatment and the diagnosis was generally associated with a poor prognosis. The exception was a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, who survived 3 years after developing LC.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: We previously reported evidence of a dose-response relationship between ionising-radiation exposure from paediatric computed tomography (CT) scans and the risk of leukaemia and brain tumours in a large UK cohort. Underlying unreported conditions could have introduced bias into these findings. METHODS: We collected and reviewed additional clinical information from radiology information systems (RIS) databases, underlying cause of death and pathology reports. We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding participants with cancer-predisposing conditions or previous unreported cancers and compared the dose-response analyses with our original results. RESULTS: We obtained information from the RIS and death certificates for about 40% of the cohort (n∼180 000) and found cancer-predisposing conditions in 4 out of 74 leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases and 13 out of 135 brain tumour cases. As these conditions were unrelated to CT exposure, exclusion of these participants did not alter the dose-response relationships. We found evidence of previous unreported cancers in 2 leukaemia/MDS cases, 7 brain tumour cases and 232 in non-cases. These previous cancers were related to increased number of CTs. Exclusion of these cancers reduced the excess relative risk per mGy by 15% from 0.036 to 0.033 for leukaemia/MDS (P-trend=0.02) and by 30% from 0.023 to 0.016 (P-trend<0.0001) for brain tumours. When we included pathology reports we had additional clinical information for 90% of the cases. Additional exclusions from these reports further reduced the risk estimates, but this sensitivity analysis may have underestimated risks as reports were only available for cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was evidence of some bias in our original risk estimates, re-analysis of the cohort with additional clinical data still showed an increased cancer risk after low-dose radiation exposure from CT scans in young patients.\n",
      "Despite the lack of long-term survival data, the impressive results obtained with fludarabine- and rituximab-based therapies have altered the philosophy of the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Therapy with chemoimmunotherapy appears to give higher responses with more patients achieving complete remission and some molecular remission. This may potentially translate into improved disease-free survival, and potentially a 'cure'. Treatment options for patients who develop resistance to fludarabine continue to be limited. This review summarises current chemo-, immuno-, and chemoimmunotherapeutic regimens that are being currently evaluated in patients with CLL.\n",
      "Twenty-four patients with primary resistant acute leukaemia received bone marrow transplants (BMTs) from matched sibling, syngeneic, matched unrelated, or mismatched family donors as treatment for induction failure. Three (12.5%) patients are alive and well 2-10 years after transplantation. Four (16.7%) patients died of transplant-related complications early post-transplant and remission status could not be determined. Two patients did not achieve complete remission (CR) and died of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis 3 months post-transplant. One patient died of graft failure. CR was obtained in 17 of 20 (85%) evaluable patients after BMT. Ten of 17 (58.8%) patients achieving CR died of transplant-related complications 1-10 months post-transplant. Four of 17 (23.5%) patients who had achieved CR relapsed after transplant. We conclude that a high proportion of patients failing to achieve remission with aggressive conventional chemotherapy achieve CR with BMT and a small proportion become long-term survivors.\n",
      "In the last two decades, important advances have been made in the biology, natural history, and prognosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In addition, treatment possibilities for patients with CLL have changed as a result of the identification of prognostic factors for survival and the availability of new drugs and treatment strategies. Patients in the early clinical stages (Binet A, Rai 0) with stable disease have a probability of long survival and should not be treated unless the disease progresses. In contrast, most patients with poor prognostic features, such as an advanced clinical stage (Binet B, C; Rai III, IV), diffuse bone-marrow infiltration or rapidly increasing blood lymphocyte levels, have a median survival probability of < 5 years and require therapy. Purine analogues are highly effective. Among these, fludarabine has become the treatment of choice for patients failing standard therapies. The role of purine analogues either alone or in combination with other drugs as front-line therapy is being investigated. Certain situations (e.g. autoimmune cytopenias, hypersplenism) require special treatment approaches (e.g. corticosteroids, splenectomy). Transplants of progenitor haematopoietic cells are also increasingly performed and deserve further investigation in younger patients with poor prognostic features. As a result of these advances, symptoms palliation is no longer the only possible goal in CLL therapy; sustained remissions and even cures are likely to be obtained in the near future.\n",
      "Transient leukaemia (TL) in neonates with Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by the transient appearance of blast cells in the peripheral blood that resolves spontaneously. Some TL patients die at an early age due to organ failure. Seventy DS patients with TL were studied retrospectively to identify clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with early death (<6 months of age). Sixteen of 70 patients (22.9%) died early. The main causes of death were organ failure, particularly hepatic and cardiopulmonary failure. On univariate analysis, early gestational age (EGA), high white blood cell (WBC) count (> or =100 x 10(9)/l), percentage of peripheral blasts, elevated aspartate transaminase (AST), elevated direct bilirubin (DB), and low Apgar score were significantly associated with poor survival. On multivariate analysis, EGA, WBC count, and DB were independent predictors of poor outcome. A simple risk stratification system combining EGA and WBC count was devised to predict poor outcome. Term infants (EGA > or = 37 weeks) whose WBC count was lower than 100 x 10(9)/l had the best outcome [7.7% (3/39) died early], while preterm infants (EGA < 37 weeks) whose WBC count was higher than 100 x 10(9)/l had the worst outcome [54.5% (6/11) died early]. This stratification system may be useful for identifying high-risk patients who need early therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "The frequencies of HLA-DP alleles in 50 acute lymphocytic, 43 acute non-lymphocytic, 50 chronic myelogenous and 51 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients were compared with 254 controls using primed lymphocyte typing. In CLL and ANLL there were significantly decreased frequencies of DPw1. Decreased DPw1 and DPw3 was observed in ALL, but after correction for the number of comparisons made this was no longer significant. However, in ALL, even after correction, there were significantly increased frequencies of DPw2 and DPw5, whereas in ANLL and CLL the only significant increases were of DP-blank, and in CML there were no positive or negative associations at all. These results suggest an influence of DP alleles in disease susceptibility and resistance in three of the four major types of leukaemia.\n",
      "Therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia has grown in complexity, first with the advent of the prototype ABL kinase inhibitor, imatinib, and subsequently with the availability of alternate (currently second-line) inhibitors. Imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib each have specific considerations regarding safety and toxicity, in addition to a limited number common to the class of ABL kinase inhibitors. Optimal management of patients on therapy requires intimate knowledge not only of response criteria and of timing but also of potential toxicities and their basis, best approaches to avoid them, strategies to manage them when identified and how they may affect response to therapy and patient outcome. With the availability of several approved kinase inhibitors and the ongoing development of additional therapies for Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) leukaemias, there is increasing incorporation of toxicity considerations into decision making between agents. This article reviews the toxicities related to the currently available ABL inhibitors - their basis, relevance and management.\n",
      "The acute myeloid leukaemia 1 (AML1) protein belongs to the Runx family of transcription factors and is crucial for haematopoietic development. The genes encoding Runx1 and its associated factor CBF beta are the most frequent targets for chromosomal rearrangements in acute human leukaemias. In addition, point mutations of Runx1 in acute leukaemias and in the familial platelet disorder FPD/AML cluster within the evolutionary conserved runt domain that binds both DNA and CBF beta. Here, the crystallization of the Runx1 runt domain is reported. Crystals belong to space groups C2 and R32 and diffract to 1.7 and 2.0 A resolution, respectively.\n",
      "Multidrug resistance (MDR) to anti-cancer agents is frequently associated with overexpression of the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in cancer cells, ensuing drug expulsion and maintenance of tolerable intracellular levels of certain cytotoxic drugs. Pgp may also be present in normal tissue, providing protection against toxic substances, but the physiological role of Pgp is not fully understood. Recently, it was shown that Pgp also takes part in the transport of certain growth-regulating cytokines (Drach et al, 1996; Raghu et al, 1996). Therefore, we studied the effect of the highly potent Pgp inhibitor PSC 833 on proliferation of three pairs of MDR and parental human cell lines (HB8065 hepatoma cells, KG1a and K562 leukaemia cells). The MDR phenotypes were characterized by Pgp overexpression, which was demonstrated by flow cytometry using the anti-Pgp antibody MRK16. Electronic cell counting of 72-96 h cultures revealed a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect of PSC 833 in the resistant KG1a/200 and K562/150 cells. The half-maximal growth inhibitory concentrations (GI50) were 0.2 microM and 0.7 microM respectively. Exposure to PSC 833 induced cell death by apoptosis in both cell types, as revealed by flow cytometry and detection of 3'-hydroxy ends of DNA (the result of DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis), by terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labelling (TUNEL). Similar effects were not found in the hepatoma cell lines or the parental leukaemia lines. These results demonstrated a discriminating cytotoxicity of PSC 833 in two human leukaemia MDR variants, representing a possible therapeutic indication which warrants consideration during the ongoing clinical evaluation of this drug.\n",
      "Although the p21X protein of human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is generally thought to be expressed from a doubly spliced mRNA transcript (tax/rex mRNA) that encodes the p40tax, p27rex and p21X proteins, we have shown previously that a novel, alternatively spliced mRNA transcript (p21X mRNA) is responsible for p21X production in HTLV-1-infected cell lines. In the present study, we analysed expression of p21X mRNA and tax/rex mRNA in uncultured and cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from eight patients with adult T cell leukaemia by using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction coupled to reverse transcription. The results demonstrated that the expression of p21X mRNA occurs constitutively in all uncultured and cultured PBMCs, whereas the expression of tax/rex mRNA is inducible in the cultured PBMCs, as described previously. In uncultured and cultured PBMCs from the one specimen in which p21X mRNA was highly expressed, the p21X protein was detectable by Western blotting. On the other hand, p27rex protein was detectable only after cultivation. These findings indicate that p21X mRNA is constitutively expressed in vivo and is responsible for production of p21X protein.\n",
      "Glucocorticoids have been used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) for many years, initially as the only agent and then as part of multiagent chemotherapy. In ALL 20% of patients are resistant to glucocorticoids at presentation but this rises to greater than 70% on relapse. It has recently been reported that the glucocorticoid receptor inhibits activity of the AP-1 transcription factor by the ligand-dependant binding of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to the fos and jun components of AP-1. Since AP-1 is necessary for cell proliferation, the upregulation or over-expression of AP-1 may be a mechanism of resistance to glucocorticoids. The aim of the study was to investigate whether AP-1 levels correlate with in vitro glucocorticoid resistance. In vitro sensitivity to glucocorticoids was measured using the MTT assay. AP-1 levels were quantified using gel shift analysis: a consensus sequence for the AP-1 binding site was synthesised, labelled with 32P and incubated with nuclear extracts of leukaemic blasts from 14 ALL and 26 CLL patients. Leukaemic blasts were treated with prednisolone or with vehicle alone before preparation of nuclear extracts. The gels were dried and bands quantified using a phosphorimager, using an appropriate internal standard and correcting for protein loading and cytoplasmic contamination of nuclear extracts. The patient samples fell into two distinct groups with respect to their sensitivity to glucocorticoids: AP-1 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.02) in sensitive blasts than resistant ones. There was no significant change in AP-1 levels after treating blasts for 4 hours with 0.2 mM prednisolone. No change was seen in CLL samples. These data show that glucocorticoid resistance is not associated with increased AP-1. Conversely, glucocorticoid resistance in these samples was apparently associated with decreased AP-1 levels in ALL samples. Whether this has any causal relationship to glucocorticoid resistance is unknown. Clearly, further studies on the role of AP-1 and related transcription factors is essential for understanding the control of proliferation and apoptosis in ALL.\n",
      "We report a case of a patient aged about 53 years, who initially presented with hematological disorders (WBC: 44000/mm3, Hb: 11g/dl, Pit: 127000/mm3) without tumoral syndrome. The Wright-Giemsa stained bone marrow and peripheral blood smears showed a population of blast cells characterized by cells with high N/C and strongly basophilic cytoplasm without granules. The nuclei were predominantly round. Nuclear chromatin was fine and contained small nucleoli. Cytochemisty was positive for peroxidase activity. Immunophenotyping showed myeloid typical markers of granulocytic lineage (MP0+, CD13+, CD33+, CD117+, CD34-). The karyotype revealed the expression of t(15;17) chromosomal translocation. The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was then evoked initially. The cytological features corresponded closely to the M1 subtype as defined in the FAB classification. The patient was treated with induction therapy according to the 7/3 protocol. One month later, he was discharged from hospital on hematological and cytogenetic remission. He died at home because of a heart attack. From the biological findings the patient was retrospectively diagnosed as having promyelocytic leukemia (hyperbasophilic form).\n",
      "In order to investigate for an association between population mixing and the occurrence of leukaemia in young people (less than 25 years), a geographical study was conducted, for the years 1979 to 1998, in Nord Cotentin (France). This area experienced between the years 1978 and 1992 a major influx of workers for the construction of a nuclear power station and a new nuclear waste reprocessing unit. A population mixing index was defined on the basis of the number of workers born outside the French department of 'La Manche' and living in each 'commune', the basic geographical unit under study. The analyses were done with indirect standardisation and Poisson regression model allowing or not for extra-Poisson variation. Urban 'communes' were considered as the reference population. The Incidence Rate Ratio was 2.7 in rural 'communes' belonging to the highest tertile of population mixing (95% Bayesian credible interval, 95%BCI=1.2-5.9). A positive trend was observed among rural strata with increasing population mixing index (IRR for trend=1.4, 95%BCI=1.1-1.8). The risk became stronger for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in children 1-6 years old in the highest tertile of population mixing (IRR=5.5, 95%BCI=1.4-23.3). These findings provide further support for a possible infective basis of childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "Workers employed in the nuclear energy industry and members of the general public living near nuclear facilities are exposed to low levels of ionising radiation as a result of the routine operation of these facilities. For the purposes of radiological protection, it is assumed that low doses of radiation confer a small increased risk of cancer upon the exposed individual and this is a major consideration in setting dose limits for workers and the general public. Quantitative estimates of radiation risk have been derived from epidemiological studies of groups exposed, on average, to high or moderate doses of radiation (such as the Japanese atomic bomb survivors), and appropriate assumptions are made for the application of such estimates to low dose conditions. There have been claims that the risks of cancer in nuclear industry workers, in their children, and in populations living around nuclear facilities have been grossly underestimated. Substantial evidence is now available from the epidemiological study of these groups. Studies of nuclear industry workforces demonstrate that currently accepted risk estimates are at about the right level, although a positive trend of leukaemia mortality with radiation dose, of a magnitude which is compatible with predictions, can be detected in the most statistically powerful workforce studies. The hypothesis that irradiation of fathers before the conception of their children materially increases the risk of childhood leukaemia has been largely discounted since it is biologically implausible and has found no support in studies using data independent of the study which generated the hypothesis. Increased levels of childhood leukaemia have occurred near certain nuclear facilities in the United Kingdom, but it is most unlikely that these are related to exposure to ionising radiation. Recent evidence suggests that these excesses are caused by a rare response to an infectious agent, which is enhanced under the unusual conditions of population mixing found in these communities. Similar excesses of childhood leukaemia have been found in other communities which have experienced unusual population mixing, but are not near nuclear facilities.\n",
      "Most children with leukaemia are anaemic at diagnosis and at various times during treatment. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) was estimated in 27 children with acute leukaemia (n = 26) or lymphoma (n = 1) at diagnosis (n = 16), in relation to treatment with high-dose methotrexate (MTX, n = 11) or cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C, n = 8), and during oral maintenance therapy (n = 10). At diagnosis, in children with anaemia serum EPO was increased, and was inversely related to haemoglobin (Hb). After treatment with high-dose MTX, in some children serum EPO increased where Hb was unchanged or increased. After treatment with high-dose Ara-C, Hb declined, and serum EPO increased markedly in everyone. During oral maintenance therapy without significant anaemia, serum EPO was slightly increased in some children. In conclusion, children with leukaemia respond to anaemia with increased serum EPO concentration, but in relation to treatment with high-dose MTX and Ara-C, additional mechanisms may influence the EPO concentration.\n",
      "The molecular effects of etoposide in haemopoietic cells suggest that mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) abnormalities can be biomarkers of patient susceptibility to the genotoxic effects of topoisomerase 2 (topo 2) inhibitors. We have prospectively studied treatment-related MLL cleavage and rearrangement in serial samples from 71 children receiving chemotherapy, using Southern blot analysis and panhandle PCR. The results were related to patient demographics, treatment details and outcome. MLL cleavage was identified in six bone marrow samples from five patients 2-10 months after the start of therapy. There was no obvious relationship between the degree of MLL cleavage and cumulative dose or schedule of topo 2 inhibitors. Three children with low percentage (23-30%) cleavage remained well and two were still receiving treatment at study completion. One child with two consecutively positive samples and higher level of MLL cleavage (45-48%) died from treatment-related toxicities and relapsed leukaemia. A patient with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis developed the highest level of MLL cleavage (50%) at 3 months and a treatment-related leukaemia with MLL rearrangement 6 months after the start of treatment. It would appear that some patients are inherently more susceptible to the genotoxic effect of topo 2 inhibitors. The degree and persistence of MLL cleavage may identify patients at risk.\n",
      "Sixty-one leukaemia patients treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a genomic human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B and -DRbeta1 matched unrelated donor (MUD) were compared with 121 patients with an HLA-identical sibling donor. All patients received conventional conditioning. We selected all patients with unrelated donors who received optimal antithymocyte globuline (ATG) dose, 6 mg/kg. One hundred and seven patients received stem cells from peripheral blood and 75 patients received bone marrow (BM) cells. The incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV were 33.4% and 34.7% in the MUD and sibling group, respectively. After year 2001, the incidence of chronic GVHD was similar in the two groups (27.8% vs. 25.8%). There was no difference in overall survival (60% vs. 60%), transplant-related mortality (18.6% vs. 16.6%) and relapse (23% vs. 26.4%) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with unrelated donors results in similar GVHD, relapse and survival as compared to using sibling donors. Reasons for this may be improved tissue-typing techniques and supportive care and optimisation of the ATG dose.\n",
      "Flow cytometry is the most accessible method for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection due to its availability in most haematological centres. Using a precise combination of different antibodies, immunophenotypic detection of MRD in acute leukaemia can be performed by identifying abnormal combinations or expressions of antigens on malignant cells at diagnosis, during and post treatment. These abnormal phenotypes, referred to as leukaemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) are either absent or expressed at low frequency in normal bone marrow (BM) cells and are used to monitor the behaviour and quantitate the amount of residual disease following treatment. In paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the level of MRD by multiparametric flow cytometry (MPFC) during therapy is recognised as an important predictor of outcome. Although less extensively studied, adult ALL and adult and paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have also demonstrated similar findings. The challenge now is incorporating this information for risk-stratification so that therapy can be tailored individually and ultimately improve outcome while also limiting treatment-related toxicity. In this review we will elaborate on the current and future role of MPFC in MRD in acute leukaemia while also addressing its limitations.\n",
      "A 19-month-old Chinese girl presented with pathological fracture of her right distal tibia. Peripheral blood revealed no abnormal cells, electrolytes were normal and bone biopsy at the fracture site only showed small aggregates of unremarkable lymphocytes. A bone marrow study could not provide a definitive diagnosis of acute leukaemia on morphology and immunohistochemistry. A diagnosis of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was unequivocally confirmed by a cytogenetic study which showed a hyperdiploid clone with gain of chromosome 4 among other trisomies.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: This nested case-control study was based on data in a cohort study of more than 18,000 petroleum distribution workers exposed to gasoline, which contains about 2%-3% benzene. Risks of leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and kidney cancer were examined relative to exposure to gasoline. METHODS: For each case, up to five individually matched controls were selected. Analyses based on the Mantel-Haenszel procedure as well as univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression were performed for each disease category. Jobs with similar exposures were grouped into homogeneous categories for analysis. Several quantitative indices of exposure to gasoline were used in the analyses: duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, frequency of peak exposure, and time of first exposure. RESULTS: No increased risks for the four cancers were found for any job category. Analyses with logistic regression models based on duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, and frequency of peak exposure did not show any increased risk or exposure-effect relation. Time of first exposure to gasoline was also found to be unrelated to the four diseases under investigation. CONCLUSION: Exposure to gasoline or benzene at the concentrations experienced by this cohort of distribution workers is not a risk factor for leukaemia (all cell types), acute myeloid leukaemia, multiple myeloma, or kidney cancer.\n",
      "Semipurified saline extracts of seeds from Crotolaria juncea, Cassia marginata, Ficus racemosa, Cicer arietinum (L-532), Gossipium indicum (G-27), Melia composita, Acacia lenticularis, Meletia ovalifolia, Acacia catechu and Peltophorum ferrenginium were tested for leukoagglutinating activity against whole leukocytes and mononuclear cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (34), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (5), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (7), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (3), various lymphoproliferative/haematologic disorders (54), and normal healthy subjects (50). In addition, bone marrow cells from three patients undergoing diagnostic bone marrow aspiration and activated lymphocytes from mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) were also tested. All the seed extracts agglutinated white blood cells from patients with different types of leukaemia. But none of them reacted with peripheral blood cells of normal individuals, patients with various lymphoproliferative/haematologic disorders or cells from MLC. Leukoagglutination of leukaemic cells with each of the seed extracts was inhibited by simple sugars. Only in one instance, cells from bone marrow of an individual who had undergone diagnostic bone marrow aspiration for a non-malignant condition were agglutinated. It is felt that purification of these seed extracts may yield leukaemia-specific lectins.\n",
      "We report a rare presentation of acute bilateral peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) in a patient with a new diagnosis of untreated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PUK associated with untreated AML and we stress the importance of a rapid and thorough testing to exclude other diagnoses. The patient lost his vision within 10 days to counting fingers. Rapid diagnosis allowed a good visual recovery following prompt treatment with oral steroids and systemic chemotherapy treatment for the AML.\n",
      "The frequency of CTL precursors (CTLp) directed towards recipient-derived pre-transplant leukaemic blasts (LB) was measured in the peripheral blood of nine children with acute leukaemia and given BMT from either an HLA-identical sibling or a matched unrelated donor (MUD). Patients were evaluated at various time points between 1 month and more than 2 years after transplantation. A high frequency of donor-derived LB-reactive CTLp was detectable 2-6 months after BMT in all children and persisted for at least up to 18 months in the eight patients in haematological remission, while it rapidly declined in the only patient who relapsed. Generation of LB-reactive T cell clones obtained from some of these patients demonstrates that various T lymphocyte subsets, either HLA class I-restricted/TCR-dependent or HLA-unrestricted, contribute to this phenomenon. The in vitro GVL effect here described seems to be at least partially separated from GVHR, since no correlation was observed between the emergence of LB-reactive CTLp and the development and/or severity of GVHD. Development of LB-reactive CTL in the patients was independent of the frequency of these cells in the donor. These data suggest that donor-derived CTL activity specifically directed towards leukaemic blasts may develop in patients given allogeneic BMT and contribute to the maintenance of a state of haematological remission.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell death induced by mammea A/BA and A/BB (3 : 1) on K562 cells. METHODS: These compounds were isolated from Calophyllum brasiliense and its cytotoxicity was tested using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell death was evaluated by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunocytofluorescence of active caspase-3. Genotoxicity was tested using comet assay. Lastly, a chemoinformatic analysis was performed with Osiris-Molinspiration software. KEY FINDINGS: The mixture of mammea A/BA and A/BB (3 : 1) showed cytotoxic activity against K562 cells (IC50 = 43.5 μm). TUNEL positive cells and active caspase-3 were detected after treatment. Genotoxicity of mammea A/BA and A/BB on K562 was detected since first hour of treatment. Additionally, mammea A/BA and A/BB were found to be in compliance with Lipinski 'rule of 5' suggesting that they possess strong potential of druglikeness. CONCLUSIONS: The overall results confirm and extend the knowledge about coumarins as an important resource of antitumor drugs, and indicate that these compounds could be used in further preclinical studies against leukaemia.\n",
      "Our aim was to review current information on body composition and bone mass after cessation of therapy for childhood cancer and to present preliminary data on body composition and bone mass in a group of Danish survivors of childhood leukaemia or lymphoma. Elevated body-mass index (weight/height2; BMI) is frequent after treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. BMI increases during therapy or within the first year after therapy and remains abnormal thereafter. Treatment with corticosteroids, abnormal growth-hormone secretion after treatment with cranial irradiation (CI) or corticosteroids, younger age at diagnosis, or female gender were risk factors for elevated BMI in earlier studies. We evaluated 185 survivors of childhood leukaemia or lymphoma by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning. We found elevated whole-body relative fat mass, which was associated with CI. Other studies found reduced bone mass in the radius, the lumbar spine and the whole body after treatment for childhood cancer. Growth-hormone deficiency that is not adequately corrected, CI, reduced height or reduced weight were risk factors for reduced bone mass. In our 185 participants, the whole-body bone mass was also reduced significantly compared with reference values. CI and older age at follow-up were risk factors for reduced bone mass. We conclude that the elevated relative fat mass and reduced bone mass seen after treatment for childhood leukaemia or lymphoma is associated mainly with CI.\n",
      "Our previous study of childhood leukaemia and distance to high-voltage overhead power lines in the UK has been included in an international pooled analysis. That pooled analysis used different distance categories to those we did, which has focussed attention on the effect of that choice. We re-analyse our previous subjects, using finer distance categories. In the 1960s and 1970s, when we principally found an elevated risk, the risk did not fall monotonically with distance from the power line but had a maximum at 100-200 m. This weakens the evidence that any elevated risks are related to magnetic fields, and slightly strengthens the evidence for a possible effect involving residential mobility or other socioeconomic factors.\n",
      "The interaction of a protease with two fluorescent inhibitors has been studied using intact fixed leukaemia cells as the source of the membrane bound enzyme. Fresh rat leukaemia cells were disrupted and the cytosol collected; this extract was known to contain a protein inhibitor of guanidinobenzoatase (GB) associated with leukaemia cells. All the cytosolic proteins were derivatised with Texas red acid chloride. Leukaemia cells with latent GB failed to bind the Texas red inhibitor protein but did so after activation of GB. Competition experiments with 9-amino acridine (a fluorescent marker for the active site of GB) demonstrated that the Texas red-inhibitor protein could only bind to intact leukaemia cells when the active centre of GB was not already occupied by 9-amino acridine. This competition between these two fluorescent inhibitors demonstrated their specificity for GB. The use of intact leukaemia cells and the high molecular weight of the inhibitor protein precludes the possibility of any interaction between GB and inhibitor within the cells. It is concluded that GB and the GB-inhibitor complex of latent GB are located on the external surface of intact leukaemia cells.\n",
      "Granzyme M (GrM) is a novel cytotoxic protein normally exclusively expressed by natural killer (NK)-cells and cytotoxic T-cells with innate immune function. As most T-cell granular lymphocytic leukaemias (T-LGL) are thought to be derived from the adaptive immune system it was predicted that T-LGL would be GrM negative. Contrary to this hypothesis, bone marrow biopsy immunohistochemistry revealed that GrM was frequently expressed in both T-LGL (16 / 18) and NK-LGL (6 / 9). These unexpected results suggest commonality between T- and NK-LGL, providing further support to the notion that T-LGL is a disorder of dysregulated, chronically stimulated, adaptive cytotoxic T-cells.\n",
      "This analysis, of 2483 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) aged 60+ years entered into two UK trials, was performed to determine the baseline parameters related to survival and to develop a risk index. The Medical Research Council (MRC) AML11 trial (n = 1071) was used to develop the index; this was validated using data from the Leukaemia Research fund (LRF) AML14 trial on 1137 intensively (AML14I) and 275 non-intensively (AML14NI) treated patients. In AML11, cytogenetic group, age, white blood count, performance status and type of AML (de novo, secondary) were all highly significantly related to prognosis in multivariate analysis. The regression coefficients were used to define good, standard and poor risk groups, with 1-year survival of 53%, 43% and 16% respectively (P < 0.0001). The risk index showed very good discrimination in both AML14I and AML14NI (both P < 0.0001), thereby providing validation, although survival in all groups was very poor in AML14NI. The risk factors for survival in older AML patients were similar to those in younger ones and discrimination of patient groups with relatively good to very poor prognosis was possible. These risk groups apply to both intensively and non-intensively treated patients. Randomized trials of intensive versus non-intensive therapy are needed to determine which types of patient should be given which type of treatment.\n",
      "Despite the development of highly effective treatment strategies for acute promyelocytic leukaemia around 10% of patients die in the presentation period as a consequence of the associated bleeding diathesis. The cause of the coagulopathy is complex resulting from a combination of tissue factor (TF) and cancer procoagulant (CP) induced disseminated intravascular coagulation, exaggerated fibrinolysis due predominantly to enhanced expression of annexin II on APL blast cell membranes and blast cell production of cytokines. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has revolutionised the treatment of APL. When combined with chemotherapy long term survival rates of up to 80% can be achieved. Commencement of ATRA induces APL blast cell differentiation and is associated with a rapid resolution of the bleeding tendency through a combination of effects which include up regulation of thrombomodulin and down regulation of TF and CP production and cell surface expression of annexin II.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: Leukaemia is the most common cancer in children, but its aetiology is still poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that traffic-related air pollution is associated with paediatric leukaemia because of chronic exposure to several potential carcinogens. METHODS: The Italian SETIL study (Study on the aetiology of lymphohematopoietic malignancies in children) was conducted in 14 Italian regions. All incident cases of leukaemia in children aged ≤10 years from these regions (period 1998-2001) were eligible for enrolment. Two controls per case, matched on birth date, gender and region of residence were randomly selected from the local population registries. Exposure assessment at birth residence included traffic indicators (distance to main roads and length of main roads within 100 m) and estimates of pollutants concentrations (particulate matter -PM2.5 and PM10- and gases -NO2 and O3-) from national dispersion model and land use regression models. The association between the exposure variables and leukaemia was assessed by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Participation rates were 91.4% among cases and 69.2% in controls; 620 cases (544 acute lymphocytic and 76 acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia) and 957 controls were included. Overall, when considering the residence at birth, 35.6% of cases and 42.4% of controls lived along busy roads, and the mean annual PM10 levels were 33.3 (SD=6.3) and 33.4 µg/m(3) (SD=6.5), respectively. No association was found, and all ORs, independent of the method of assessment and the exposure windows, were close to the null value. CONCLUSIONS: Using various exposure assessment strategies, air pollution appears not to affect the incidence of childhood leukaemia.\n",
      "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have captured the attention of researchers today due to their multipotent differentiation capacity. Also, they have been successfully applied clinically, in the treatment of various diseases of the heart and musculoskeletal systems, with encouraging results. Their supportive role in haematopoiesis and their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties have enhanced their contribution towards the improvement of engraftment and the treatment of graft-versus-host disease in patients receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, there is a growing body of research that supports the involvement of MSCs in leukaemogenesis with several genetic and functional abnormalities having been detected in the MSCs of leukaemia patients. MSCs also exert leukaemia-enhancing effects and induce chemotherapy resistance in leukaemia cells. This paper addresses the key issues in the therapeutic value as well as the harmful effects of the MSCs in leukaemia with a sharp focus on the recent updates in the published literature.\n",
      "Acquired ring chromosomes have been found in most types of human neoplasia, with a frequency approaching 10% in malignant mesenchymal tumours. In this study, the composition and dynamics of ring chromosomes were analysed in eight cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia, 17 solid tumours, and five cases with constitutional rings. Chromosomal banding and fluorescence in situ hybridisation were performed to determine the content and the structural heterogeneity of the rings. Telomeric repeats were detected using peptide nucleic acid probes or primed in situ labelling, whereas centromeric activity was evaluated by detection of kinetochore proteins. Mitotic instability was assessed by the frequency of anaphase bridges. The results suggest that human ring chromosomes can be structurally and functionally divided into two categories. In the first of these, size variation is minimal and rearrangement at cell division is uncommon. The majority of such rings contain subtelomeric sequences. Constitutional ring chromosomes and most rings in leukaemias belong to this group, whereas only a few mesenchymal tumours exhibit rings of this type. The second category consists of rings with amplified sequences, primarily from chromosome 12, characteristically occurring in atypical lipomatous tumours and other subtypes of low or borderline malignant mesenchymal neoplasms. Variation in size and number is extensive, and breakage-fusion-bridge events occur at a high frequency. Abnormalities in pericentromeric sequences are common and, in some cases, kinetochores assemble in the absence of alphoid DNA. We conclude that it is not only the ring structure per se or the neoplastic nature of the host cell that determines ring instability, but probably also the functional role of the genes carried in the ring.\n",
      "Unexplained clusters of childhood leukaemia have generated concern that they may be causally related to environmental exposure to ionising radiation. The workshop provides in-depth examination of the aetiology of childhood leukaemia, patterns of clustering exhibited by cases and the influence of exposure to ionising radiation. Special attention has been focussed on the EUROCLUS study of clustering of childhood leukaemia and monitoring of populations exposed to contamination following the Chernobyl accident. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that environmental ionising radiation exposure is a causative agent for small clusters such as that reported in the vicinity of the Krümmel nuclear facility\n",
      "BACKGROUND: For most conditions amenable to bone-marrow transplantation, grafts from HLA-matched but unrelated donors have yielded poorer results than those obtained from matched-sibling donors. We assessed this pattern in the light of improvements in donor selection and post-transplant supportive care. METHODS: We reviewed transplant outcome in 103 consecutive patients with childhood leukaemia who underwent allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation with HLA-matched sibling marrow (n = 52) or matched unrelated donor marrow (n = 51) between May, 1990, and March, 1996, at St Jude Children Research Hospital. FINDINGS: Analysis of engraftment, frequency of procedure-related complications, and disease-free survival revealed no advantage from use of matched-sibling marrow. The 2-year disease-free survival estimate for standard-risk recipients of matched-sibling marrow was 81 [8.1]% compared with 73 [12.1]% in the unrelated donor marrow group (p = 0.77). In the high-risk category, patients with a matched-sibling donor had a 2-year disease-free survival of 31 [11.6]%, compared with 32 [15.1]% among recipients of matched unrelated donor marrow (p = 0.87). INTERPRETATION: We believe this improved result with unrelated donor marrow is a consequence of recent innovations in histocompatibility matching, prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and antiviral prophylaxis. We suggest that such grafts can now be used in patients at both standard and high risk without compromising treatment outcome.\n",
      "We investigate the personalisation and prediction accuracy of mathematical models for white blood cell (WBC) count dynamics during consolidation treatment using intermediate or high-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Ara-C is the clinically most relevant cytotoxic agent for AML treatment. We extend a mathematical model of myelosuppression and a pharmacokinetic model of Ara-C with different hypotheses of Ara-C pharmacodynamic effects. We cross-validate the 12 model variations using dense WBC count measurements from 23 AML patients. Surprisingly, the prediction accuracy remains satisfactory in each of the models despite different modelling hypotheses. Therefore, we compare average clinical and calculated WBC recovery times for different Ara-C schedules as a successful methodology for model discrimination. As a result, a new hypothesis of a secondary pharmacodynamic effect on the proliferation rate seems plausible. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of treatment timing on subsequent nadir values based on personalised predictions as a possibility for influencing/controlling myelosuppression.\n",
      "AIM: To examine the effects of echinomycin, a compound that inhibits DNA-binding activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1), on leukaemia cell growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three acute myeloid leukaemia cell lines and three T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines were cultured with echinomycin. Cell growth, mRNA and protein expression levels were examined by WST-1 assay, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. RESULTS: HIF1α protein was expressed in all cell lines under normoxia. Treatment with echinomycin suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis in association with decreased mRNA expression of HIF1 targets, glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and B-cell CLL/lymphoma-2 (BCL2). Echinomycin also suppressed the protein expression of NOTCH1, cleaved NOTCH1, v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog-1 (AKT), phosphorylated AKT, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and phosphorylated mTOR and increased that of cleaved caspase-3 in some cell lines. CONCLUSION: Echinomycin suppresses leukaemia cell growth in association with reduced NOTCH1 expression. This is the first report to show that HIF inhibitor treatment suppresses NOTCH1 signalling. HIF inhibitors could be novel candidates for a molecular-targeted therapy against leukaemia.\n",
      "Various clinical and laboratory observations suggest that the leukaemia cells in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) are potentially immunogenic. Whilst the ability of the leukaemia cells to elicit an anti-leukaemic immune response in the allogeneic setting is established, it remains unclear why such anti-leukaemic response does not occur in vivo in the autologous setting. We previously demonstrated the presence of leukaemia-reactive T cells in a patient with CML. However, we found that the T cells were normally anergic unless pre-incubated in vitro in high-dose recombinant interleukin-2. We speculated that the T cell anergy was the result of a lack of the appropriate immune costimulatory molecules on the leukaemia cell surface. In this study, we confirm the absence of immune costimulatory molecules, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), on leukaemia cells and demonstrated that these costimulatory molecules on the leukaemia cells can be upregulated by a combination of GM-CSF and IL-4. There was an associated restoration of leukaemia cell immunogenicity to autologous T cells in mixed lymphocyte leukaemia reactions, suggesting a possible enhancement of anti-leukaemic reaction. More importantly, T cells primed with 'activated' leukaemia cells were able to recognise fresh cytokine-naive leukaemia cells. Furthermore, leukaemia cells expressing the dendritic cell marker, CD1a, were also generated. Our findings therefore suggest the opportunity in future to use these combination cytokines in vivo or these leukaemia cells which have been activated in vitro for leukaemia immunotherapy.\n",
      "Some members of a series of 12-alkyloxy benzo[c]phenanthridines are potent inhibitors of the growth of P388 tumour cells in vitro, with a strong dependence on the nature of the 12-substituent. Analogues with a quaternary nitrogen in the side chain bind strongly to DNA but are less active against the tumour cells. The multi-drug-resistant cell line Pr8/22 shows less sensitivity to the new compounds. K562 Human leukaemia cells undergo differentiation in the presence of the benzo[c]phenanthridine derivatives with a structure-activity relationship which does not correlate well with potency against the P388 cell line.\n",
      "Genetic mutations in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are assumed to occur in a sequential order; however, the predominant hierarchical roles of specific mutated genes have not been fully described. In this study, we aimed to determine the clonal involvement of the most frequent AML-associated mutations. Using a targeted sequencing panel for 18 genes, we traced changes and relative clonal contribution of mutations in 52 patients. We analysed 35 pairs of diagnosis and relapse samples, 27 pairs of primary samples and corresponding patient-derived xenografts, and 34 pairs of total leukocytes and corresponding isolated primitive cells or blast populations. In both relapse and xenografts, we observed conservation of main leukaemic clones and variability was limited to subclones with late-acquired mutations. AML evolution thus mainly involved modification of subclones while the clonal background remained unchanged. NPM1 mutations were identified as the most probable leukaemia-transformation lesion, remaining conserved in contrast to high variation of accompanying subclonal FLT3 and NRAS mutations. DNMT3A mutations represented the most stable mutations forming a preleukaemic background in most samples. Mutations in genes IDH1/2, TET2, RUNX1, ASXL1 and U2AF1 were detected both as preleukaemic and as subclonal lesions, suggesting a non-specific order of acquisition.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Is it possible to eliminate metastasised chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells from ovarian cortex fragments by inhibition of Aurora B/C kinases (AURKB/C) without compromising ovarian tissue or follicles? METHODS: Human ovarian cortex tissue with experimentally induced tumour foci of CML, AML and primary cells of AML patients were exposed to a 24h treatment with 1 μM GSK1070916, an AURKB/C inhibitor, to eliminate malignant cells by invoking mitotic catastrophe. After treatment, the inhibitor was removed, followed by an additional culture period of 6 days to allow any remaining tumour cells to form new foci. Ovarian tissue integrity after treatment was analysed by four different assays. Appropriate controls were included in all experiments. RESULTS: Foci of metastasised CML and AML cells in ovarian cortex tissue were severely affected by a 24h ex vivo treatment with an AURKB/C inhibitor, leading to the formation of multi-nuclear syncytia and large-scale apoptosis. Ovarian tissue morphology and viability was not compromised by the treatment, as no significant difference was observed regarding the percentage of morphologically normal follicles, follicular viability, glucose uptake or in vitro growth of small follicles between ovarian cortex treated with 1 μM GSK1070916 and the control. CONCLUSION: Purging of CML/AML metastases in ovarian cortex is possible by targeting the Mitotic Catastrophe Signalling Pathway using GSK1070916 without affecting the ovarian tissue. This provides a therapeutic strategy to prevent reintroduction of leukaemia and enhances safety of autotransplantation in leukaemia patients currently considered at high risk for ovarian involvement.\n",
      "The MLL gene, located at 11q23, is frequently rearranged in acute leukaemia as either chimaeric fusion genes or partial tandem duplications. We report a series of 12 acute leukaemia cases with apparent amplification of the MLL gene ascertained using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Seven cases showed intrachromosomal amplification of MLL, four cases showed extrachromosomal amplification as double minute chromosomes (dmin) and one case had separate subclones with dmin and homogenously staining region (hsr). Southern blot analysis of the MLL gene showed MLL gene rearrangement in three of the 10 successful cases. These cases do not naturally fall into either of the two recognised categories of MLL rearrangement and may represent a third variety of MLL gene abnormalities.\n",
      "Development of resistance to 1-beta-arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC) is a major obstacle in the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Deficiency of functional deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) plays an important role in AraC resistance in vitro. We screened 5378 bp sequences of the dCK gene, including all exons and the 5' flanking region, and identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regulatory region (rSNPs) with high allele frequencies. These two rSNPs (-201C>T and -360C>G) formed two major haplotypes. Genotyping with sequencing and MassARRAY system among 122 AML patients showed that those with -360CG/-201CT and -360GG/-201TT compound genotypes (n = 41) displayed a favourable response to chemotherapy whereas those with -360CC/-201CC (n = 81) tended to have a poor response (P = 0.025). Moreover, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that patients with -360CG/-201CT and -360GG/-201TT genotypes expressed higher level of dCK mRNA compared to those with the -360CC/-201CC genotype (P = 0.0034). Luciferase-reporter assay showed that dCK 5' regulatory region bearing -360G/-201T genotype alone had an eight-fold greater transcriptional activation activity compared to that with -360C/-201C genotype, whereas co-transfection of both -360G/-201T and -360C/-201C constructs mimicked the heterozygous genotype, which exhibited a four-fold greater activity compared to that with -360C/-201C. These results indicate that rSNP haplotypes of dCK gene may serve as a genetic marker for predicting drug responsiveness, which will be beneficial in establishing more effective AML chemotherapeutic regimens.\n",
      "Persistent aplasia is a rare complication with poor prognosis after intensive chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. A 59-year-old man with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), was treated after 186 d of chemotherapy-induced persistent aplasia with an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) after dose-reduced conditioning. The patient remains in complete haematological remission more than 8.5 months after haematological recovery. We believe that this is the first reported case of treatment for chemotherapy-induced persistent aplasia with MUD-PBSCT after dose-reduced conditioning, a procedure that can be successfully performed even in elderly patients.\n",
      "We report the first case of ischaemic optic neuropathy (ION) linked to chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) and its associated vasculitis. We discuss the link between CMML and vasculitis and the evidence suggesting it can cause anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy through a vasculitic process. We highlight the difficulty and delay in diagnosis as the use of steroids masked an underlying systemic process. Recurrent ION and raised inflammatory markers should raise suspicion of vasculitis. Together with an elevated monocyte but low platelet count, CMML should be considered.\n",
      "Thirteen 5,11-dimethyl-6H-pyrido[3,2-b]carbazoles, structurally related to the antitumour drug ellipticine, were tested for their cytotoxicity against the L1210 murine leukaemia cell line and their antitumour activity against both leukaemias and solid tumours. Most of them showed an interesting antitumour activity against L1210 leukaemia, 4-hydroxy-9-chloro-2,3, 5,11-tetramethyl-6H-pyrido[3,2-b]carbazole displaying a high antitumour activity against L1210 and P388 leukaemias, B16 melanoma and M5076 sarcoma. Despite promising cytotoxic activity, 4-ethoxy-5,11-dimethyl-6H-pyrido-[3,2-b]carbazole had no antitumour activity. The ability of four drugs to induce strand breaks in DNA was studied using the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay). Most of the molecules induced DNA breaks that were totally or partially repaired after 1 h. The effects of these compounds on the L1210 cell cycle were tested as well as their abilities to induce apoptosis in these cells. Three of them induced a G2/M blockade, without any obvious evidence of apoptosis. The other compound, 4-ethoxy-5,11-dimethyl-6H-pyrido[3,2b]carbazole, did not lead to phase-specific blockade, but was a strong inductor of apoptosis in L1210 cells.\n",
      "The recovery of circulating haemopoietic progenitor cells was evaluated serially in seven patients for 3-4 weeks after bone marrow transplantation (two autologous and five allogeneic) as treatment for leukaemia. Eight normal healthy volunteers were used as controls. CFU-G (colony forming unit-granulocyte) was found to be the earliest progenitor cell to recover at a mean interval of 16 +/- 1 (SE) days post-transplantation. A lag of 7 days was found before circulating CFU-GM (colony forming unit-granulocyte, monocyte) reappeared, while BFU-E (burst forming unit-erythroid) were detectable in only two patients in the first 4 weeks. The peak level of circulating progenitors was very low, 28 +/- 8/ml, compared with a mean level of 619 +/- 235/ml in eight normal individuals. This pattern of circulating progenitor cell recovery post-transplantation was consistently seen in all patients. CFU-G reappeared significantly earlier than CFU-GM suggesting that early granulocytic recovery after bone marrow transplantation is mediated by proliferation of mature progenitors committed to the granulocytic lineage, whereas later reconstitution is accompanied by the emergence of CFU-GM.\n",
      "Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cell lines resistant to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have been previously derived from the NB4 cell line, and characterized as having lost the expression of the intact pml/RAR alpha fusion protein. To confirm the association between ATRA-resistance and alteration in the fusion protein at the clonal level, 16 clones were generated from ATRA-resistant APL cell lines. All clones show immunological (HLA class I and II, CD11b and c, CD13 and 33), molecular and growth features similar to the parental cell lines. To investigate whether the irradiation protocol used to generate the previously reported retinoic acid-resistant NB4.306 cell line induced additional alterations that could render these cells able to escape the anti-proliferative effect of retinoic acid (ATRA), an additional ATRA-resistant APL cell line, [NB4.007/6], was generated, under the selective pressure of ATRA, from the NB4 cell line without previous radiation. This cell line shows resistance to the anti-proliferative and differentiating action of ATRA. The NB4.007/6 cell line contains the t(15;17) chromosome translocation, shows the usual pml/RAR alpha hybrid DNA but expresses no detectable amount of the usual pml/RAR alpha protein in Western blot analysis, similarly to the NB4.306 cell line. Finally, the relative resistance to ATRA of NB4.306 and NB4.007/6 was evaluated by comparing the phenotypic (CD11b) changes induced by ATRA in these two lines with those induced in the parental, ATRA-sensitive, NB4 cell line. It is estimated that NB4.306 and NB4.007/6 are about 300 and 70 times less sensitive to ATRA than the original NB4 cell line.\n",
      "Most acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) patients suffer from disordered haemostasis. APL can be treated successfully in most instances by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy, which induces endpoint maturation of the leukaemic promyelocytes with the characteristic t(15;17). Annexin II (AnII), a profibrinolytic protein, has been implicated in the bleeding manifestation seen in APL. Our group has shown previously that high levels of AnII are expressed on other acute myeloid leukaemia subtypes that are sometimes associated with disordered haemostasis, albeit less frequently than APL. This study examined the effects of ATRA on AnII expression and cell differentiation, on myeloid leukaemia cell lines to determine whether a regulatory influence on AnII may contribute to the return of haemostatic stability in APL following treatment. The results confirmed that AnII expression in the APL cell line (NB4) was significantly downregulated in response to ATRA (P < 0.01), with associated morphological and immunophenotypical evidence of myeloid differentiation. ATRA also downregulated AnII expression on other myeloid cell lines, albeit to a lesser extent than observed on NB4 cells. The results provide evidence that ATRA may resolve the hyperfibrinolysis in APL by downregulation of AnII expression.\n",
      "Minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML-MO) is a poorly differentiated type of acute myeloid leukaemia. Its myeloid differentiation can only be demonstrated by the immunohistochemical or ultrastructural finding of cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase in bone marrow blasts and/or by the immunohistochemical expression of at least one lineage-specific myeloid antigen, with no reactivity for lymphoid antigens. We describe a man with a cutaneous nodular eruption that represented the first clinical manifestation of AML-MO. Histological examination showed extensive proliferation of blasts with scant basophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, these expressed neither myeloid nor lymphoid-specific antigens, whereas they were focally positive for CD45. The diagnosis of AML-MO was confirmed by immunophenotypic analysis of a bone marrow smear. A complete remission was achieved following parenteral steroid therapy. The disease relapsed some months later, and the patient died within a few weeks.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To collate evidence of changes in body composition following treatment of leukaemia in children, teenagers and young adults (CTYA, 0-24 years) with allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant and total body irradiation (HSCT+TBI). METHODS: Papers were identified by searching Medline and Google Scholar, reference lists/citations and contacting key authors, with no date or language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were as follows: leukaemia, HSCT+TBI, aged ≤ 24 years at HSCT and changes in body composition (total fat, central adiposity, adipose tissue function, muscle mass, muscle function). Quality was assessed using a brief Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: Of 900 papers, 20 were included: seven controlled, five uncontrolled studies and eight case reports. Study quality appeared good. There was little evidence of differences in total fat/weight for HSCT + TBI groups (compared to healthy controls/population norms/short stature controls). There was some evidence of significantly higher central adiposity and differences in adipose tissue function (compared to leukaemic/non-leukaemic controls). Muscle mass was significantly lower (compared to healthy/obese controls). Muscle function results were inconclusive but suggested impairment. Case reports confirmed a lipodystrophic phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Early remodelling of adipose tissue and loss of skeletal muscle are evident following HSCT + TBI for CTYA leukaemia, with extreme phenotype of overt lipodystrophy. There is some evidence for reduced muscle effectiveness. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Body composition changes in patients after HSCT + TBI are apparent by early adult life and link with the risk of excess cardiometabolic morbidity seen in adult survivors. Interventions to improve muscle and/or adipose function, perhaps utilizing nutritional manipulation and/or targeted activity, should be investigated.\n",
      "Plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) was investigated in five patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) before and after administration of the differentiating agent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). The purpose of this study was to see how the proteolytic state associated with APL affects VWF structure and function and whether ATRA reverses any abnormality. At the onset of APL, multimeric analysis of plasma VWF revealed a lack of the largest multimers. After ATRA, there was a progressive correction of the multimeric pattern in all cases, with transient appearance of ultralarge multimers in two cases. Proteolysis was investigated with immunopurified and reduced VWF from each patient plasma. This was electrophoresed and probed with two monoclonal antibodies that identify the 225 kD native subunit and the three native fragments of 189, 176 and 140 kD and differentiate novel proteolytic fragments produced by different proteinases. At the onset of APL, the 225 kD native subunit was relatively decreased, with the appearance of an array of novel VWF proteolytic fragments, ranging in size from <140 to <225 kD. These novel fragments observed in patients were similar to those produced in vitro by digestion of purified VWF with plasmin or elastase. After ATRA therapy, proteolysis diminished progressively in parallel with the improvement of other haemostatic measurements, but persisted to some extent. We conclude that VWF proteolysis in APL is produced by plasmin and elastase. Changes of VWF structure and function might adversely affect haemostasis in APL. Therefore, improvement of VWF after ATRA administration might explain in part the effectiveness of this drug in reducing haemorrhagic complications.\n",
      "AIMS: The purpose of this report is to describe a new instrument designed for the injection of therapeutic agents directly into the bone marrow cavity as well as to aspirate bone marrow specimens for the diagnostic purposes. METHODS: The instrument consists of three parts: the needle, stilette and an adjustable guard. The overall length of the needle is 76 mm and has uniform external diameter except for the distal penetrating segment, which is sharp but short and safe to use on the sternum. The proximal end of the needle is fitted with a plastic T-bar handle, which is ergonomically designed for firm grip and easy manoeuvrability. RESULTS: The instrument has been designed to obtain bone marrow aspirate specimens as well as to inject therapeutic agents into the posterior ilium. CONCLUSIONS: The rationale for the intramedullary injection of therapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with leukaemia, lymphoma and other haematological and non-haematological malignant disorders is described. In an emergency when intravenous therapy becomes difficult due to collapsed veins, this instrument may be used for direct intramarrow infusion of blood and blood products.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of rearrangement of the myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia gene in acute leukaemia in Hong Kong Chinese children. DESIGN: Immunophenotyping, cytogenetic, and molecular analysis. SETTING: Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples were taken from 27 children aged 16 years or younger with acute leukaemia, from September 1995 through February 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gene rearrangement was analysed by Southern blotting of HindIII digestion products of mononuclear cell DNA, followed by hybridisation with the myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia P/S4 probe. Nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to detect and characterise duplication of the myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia gene. RESULTS: Only one (4%) of 23 children whose marrow or peripheral blood samples contained adequate material for genetic study showed rearrangement in the myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia gene. No children were positive for partial tandem duplication of the myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia gene. CONCLUSION: Myeloid-lymphoid leukaemia gene rearrangement is rare in Hong Kong Chinese children with acute leukaemia.\n",
      "Traditional approaches to haematological diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) include microscopic examination of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells studied in Romanowsky-stained, dry film smears. The routine evaluation of BM aspirates, however, may be disappointing in accurately assessing marrow activity because of the sampling error inherent in the BM aspiration technique, and occasionally may fail to provide a precise diagnosis because BM aspirates cannot be obtained due to packed or fibrotic marrows. Because of the advantages it offers over the conventional method of diagnosis, we have studied Romanowsky-stained, thin sections of plastic-embedded BM biopsies from 87 newly diagnosed AML patients. Based on our study, the patients were broadly grouped into four categories: (1) those with hypocellular marrow (haemopoietic cellularity less than 50%), hypoplastic AML; (2) those with some degree of marrow fibrosis, AML with marrow fibrosis; (3) those with homogeneous infiltration of marrow with blast cells; and (4) those with inhomogenous infiltration of marrow with blast cells. Our results show that the proposed classification of AML based on the evaluation of plastic-embedded BM biopsy sections may offer benefits over those afforded by conventional morphologic smear techniques. This may provide significant prognostic information and may have a major impact on patient management. It may also provide a meaningful stratification of the patient population when comparing treatment protocols for newly diagnosed AML patients.\n",
      "The blast cell population of 60 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) were analyzed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to determine the cell surface antigen phenotypes. In addition, cytochemical stains periodic acid Schiff (PAS), myeloperoxidase (MP), Sudan black B (SBB) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) were also utilized for subtyping. Nineteen cases (31.6%) expressed lymphoid phenotypes characteristic of common ALL cells and one case with extramedullary lymph node crisis expressed T-cell surface phenotypes. Thirty cases (50%) expressed solely myelomonocytic surface antigens with significant TdT activity in three. Cytochemical stains contributed to recognize only 57% of these myeloid blasts. Seven cases (11.7%) were with a mixture of heterogenous group of cells expressing phenotypic characteristics for various haemopoietic cells of different lineage--five of them from the cells of non-lymphoid series (myelomono-erythromegakaryocytic series) and the other two with cells from both lymphoid and myeloid series. Additionally, in two cases (3.3%), the precursor cells reacted only with the erythroid monoclonals. Finally, in one case, the blast cells remained unclassified due to nonreactivity with any of the monoclonals used but expressed significant TdT positivity. The response to uniform vincristine and prednisolone (V + P) therapy has shown that lymphoid blast crisis cases were highly responsive in contrast to the cases with non-lymphoid blast crisis (complete remission rate 86 vs 21.4%). The results confirm the evidence of multilineage blast crisis involving either single or mixed haemopoietic differentiation pathway and the utility of having phenotypic characterisation for designing protocols for chemotherapy in the CML patients at the time of blast crisis.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Residual disease (RD) detected using multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) is an independent predictive variable of relapse in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, RD thresholds and optimal assessment time points remain to be validated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated the significance of RD after induction therapy in paediatric AML with normal karyotype between June 2008 and June 2018. Bone marrow samples from 73 patients were collected at the end of the first (BMA-1) and second (BMA-2) induction courses to monitor RD using MFC. RESULTS: Presence of RD after BMA-1 and/or BMA-2 correlated with poor relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival at 0.1% RD cutoff level. Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that RD cutoff levels of 1.3% and 0.5% after BMA-1 and BMA-2, respectively, predicted events with the highest sensitivity and specificity. In multivariable analysis, RD after BMA-2 was the strongest independent risk predictor for poor RFS (hazard ratio 2.934; 95% confidence interval: 1.106-7.782; P = .031). CONCLUSIONS: Our study therefore suggests that an RD level ≥0.5% after BMA-2 has a significant predictive impact on the prognosis of AML patients having normal karyotype and thus guide the stratification of treatment strategies.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Aberrant activation of Wnt signalling through hypermethylation of Wnt inhibitor genes is involved in several human malignancies, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). It remains unclear whether hypermethylation of Wnt inhibitors is associated with molecular gene mutations in the development of AML. METHODS: We investigated the association of the promoter hypermethylation of six Wnt inhibitors (Wif-1, SFRP1, SFRR2, SFRP4, SFRP5, and DKK1) with gene aberrations in the leukaemogenesis of 269 AML patients. RESULTS: In total, 166 patients (61.7%) had hypermethylation of at least one Wnt inhibitor. The majority (68.5%) of patients with Wnt inhibitor hypermethylation had concurrent Class II gene mutations that affect transcription factors or cofactors. There was a close association of Wif-1 hypermethylation with t(15;17) (P=0.0005) and CEBPA mutation (P<0.0001), DKK1 hypermethylation with t(8;21) (P<0.0001) and ASXL1 mutation (P=0.0078), SFRP-1 hypermethylation with t(8;21) (P<0.0001), SFRP-2 hypermethylation with AML1/RUNX1 mutation (P=0.0012), and SFRP-5 hypermethylation with MLL/PTD (P=0.0505). On the other side, hypermethylation of Wnt inhibitors was always negatively associated with NPM1 mutation and FLT3/ITD. CONCLUSION: There was distinct association between hypermethylation of individual Wnt inhibitors and specific gene aberrations, especially Class II mutations. The Wnt inhibitor hypermethylation might interact with genetic alterations in the leukaemogenesis.\n",
      "Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMGL) is an uncommon disease with poor prognosis. Histopathologically, AMGL cases show variable degree of fibrosis and the presence of uniform blasts or mature dysplastic megakaryocytes. Here we examined 18 cases of AMGL, including idiopathic (n = 9) and secondary (n = 9) cases. Fourteen cases were males and four were females, ranging in age from 14 to 87 years (median, 58). All cases had anaemia, but leukocyte and platelet counts varied. Blast cells were detected in the peripheral blood of 14 cases. Fourteen of 16 cases showed chromosomal abnormalities. The median survival was 6 months (range, 1-48 months). Survival rates did not correlate with the severity of fibrosis, proportion of blast cells and cause of AMGL. Nine of the 11 cases examined immunohistochemically were positive for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)(-BB), especially megakaryoblasts and a few fibroblasts. The PDGF-positive cases showed various degrees of fibrosis, while the negative cases showed no evidence of fibrosis. Our results confirmed the poor prognosis of patients with AMGL, irrespective of the degrees of fibrosis, and demonstrated that PDGF could play an important role in the pathogenesis of marrow fibrosis.\n",
      "Using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we identified a patient with typical clinical features of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase who showed no amplification of the CML-type BCR/ABL transcript. RT-PCR with primers detecting the acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL)-type transcript disclosed a novel fragment co-amplified with an ALL-type fragment. Sequencing revealed the novel transcript to be a chimaeric mRNA produced by fusion of a segment of BCR exon 2 (e2) to ABL exon 2 (a2), with a 21 base-pair insertion of ABL intron 1b sequence between them. This transcript has not been reported previously.\n",
      "A computer-based file of all Veterans Administration (VA) hospitalisation records for the period 1969-1985 was used to identify and follow for cancer development a cohort of 5,161 white males with pernicious anaemia. A total of 34,915 person-years were accrued, with an average length of follow-up of 6.8 years. A total of 481 cancers were diagnosed, slightly higher than the number expected (SIR = 1.2). Significant excesses were observed for cancers of the buccal cavity and pharynx (1.8) and stomach (3.2), and for melanoma (2.1), multiple myeloma (2.1), myeloid leukaemia (3.7) and other and unspecified leukaemia (4.0). Although the excess for stomach cancer was highest in the first year after diagnosis in a VA hospital, risks of 2-fold or greater persisted throughout the study period. The majority of leukaemias occurred in the first year of follow-up, but some excess risk continued beyond this time. The elevated risk of buccal and pharyngeal cancers may relate to heavy alcohol intake among this population, although risks remained high even when the cohort was restricted to patients without an admission for alcoholism. Although an elevated risk of stomach cancer among pernicious anaemia patients is consistent with most previous surveys, the low absolute risk suggests that the cost-effectiveness of intensive screening should be reassessed.\n",
      "Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is a rare localized, extramedullary tumor composed of immature cells of granulocyte series. It is capable of marked local tissue destruction. This condition can be a precursor of acute myeloid leukaemia by months or years making its diagnosis critical. Its occurrence has been described in multiple sites including skin, lymph nodes, bone, and visceral organs. It is extremely rare in the oral cavity and only 30 cases have been reported in the literature to date and often as a lump in the gingiva, palate, and extraction sockets. We describe the first reported case of GS presenting as a solitary lump in the lip and review the pertinent literature.\n",
      "We report a patient in the accelerated phase of Philadelphia-chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia who developed fibrosis in lungs, spleen and bone marrow. In the lungs, fibrosis was demonstrated in the alveolar septa which had been infiltrated by giant, bizarre-shaped cells resembling the megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. The relationship between the fibrosis and megakaryocytoid cell infiltration in the lungs is discussed.\n",
      "It is hypothesised that an effective graft-vs.-leukaemia reaction contributes substantially to the therapeutic effect of reduced intensity conditioning stem cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukaemia. However, kinetic data on eradication of leukaemia cells and stem cell engraftement which could support this assumption are lacking. Thus, we investigated bcr/abl fusion transcripts and haematopoietic chimerism in 14 patients undergoing such a transplantation protocol. Ten of them obtained a complete molecular remission, and two patients achieved haematologic remissions but remained bcr/abl positive. Weekly determinations of bcr/abl transcript numbers by qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and donor chimerism revealed that 10 responders cleared bcr/abl positive cells from the peripheral blood within a median of 9 wk (range 3-22 wk). The close relation (P = 0.0075) between the first occurrence of graft-vs.-host disease and the complete clearance of bcr/abl positive blood cells argues in favour of an effective graft-vs.-leukaemia reaction.\n",
      "Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder associated with pancytopenia, splenomegaly and the presence of typical hairy B lymphocytes in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood. The most significant complication relates to opportunistic infections that arise as a consequence of neutropenia and monocytopenia. HCL is occasionally associated with systemic autoimmune disorders including polyarteritis nodosa and rheumatoid disease. Secondary autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) appears to be rare. We report on two cases of HCL complicated by fatal cold anti-i AIHA. Fulminant haemolysis causing death is rare in cold AIHA and only a few individual cases have been reported, none having anti-i specificity.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Platelet transfusion plays a critical role in the supportive treatment of acute leukaemia patients who receive chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). There are few studies assessing appropriateness of platelet transfusion in this population. An audit was conducted to determine how appropriately platelets are transfused in acute leukaemia patients at a tertiary care health institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A six-year retrospective audit was conducted in acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients in an Academic Centre. Episodes were assessed as either appropriate or inappropriate based on guidelines from the British Society for Haematology (BSH). Pre-transfusion platelet count, transfusion indication, World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding score, and antibiotic use were all documented. RESULTS: Overall, 745 platelet transfusion episodes in 154 patients were audited. The proportion of episodes appropriately indicated according to BSH guidelines was 75.3%. Paediatrics and Internal Medicine had the lowest and highest proportion of appropriateness by department at 63.9% and 86.8%, respectively. The best alignment to guidelines was found on the wards (82.3%). Inpatient cases were significantly better indicated (p=0.002), whereas therapeutic and HSCT-related transfusions were not. The majority of inappropriate transfusions had a pre-transfusion count >20×109/L without a valid justification (45.1%), whereas appropriate episodes were mainly accounted for by a pre-transfusion count <10×109/L (69%). DISCUSSION: The 25% rate of inappropriate platelet transfusion in acute leukaemia patients underscores the learning needs of physicians, particularly those in training, regarding adequate use of platelets in haematologic malignancies to optimise its utilisation and patient outcome.\n",
      "A retrospective analysis was performed on 235 elderly acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) patients aged 60 years or more, consecutively admitted to a single haematological department during a 10-year period from 1980 to 1989. 46% of patients received only conventional induction chemotherapy. The rate of inclusion in EORTC cooperative clinical trials was significantly lower than for younger patients despite specific protocols proposed for the elderly since 1983, thus confirming the important selection bias of most published series on elderly AML patients. Compared with treatment results in patients < 60 years, complete remission (CR) rate was lower (33.3% v 65.4%, P < 0.0001), with a marked drop in patients older than 70, and induction death rate was higher (21.3% v 12.5%, P = 0.04). Intrinsic characteristics of leukaemic cells, especially expression of the MDR1 gene, in vitro growth of the leukaemic clonogenic cells and sensitivity to daunorubicin-(+)cytosine arabinoside, did not differ according to age, except that there was a higher incidence of previous myelodysplastic syndromes and a lower incidence of good prognostic cytogenetics in the elderly patients. Thus, treatment failure in elderly AML patients appears to be mainly due to host-related factors (especially performance status and age < or > or = 70 years), and to inadequate treatments. Some elderly patients may have been undertreated because of the planned anthracycline dose reduction, resulting in a higher rate of 'resistant' AML, i.e. patients surviving the induction period without entering into CR, than in younger patients (45.4% v 22.1%, P < 0.0001). 11 patients (4.7%) with untreated or 'resistant' AML survived more than 1 year, while receiving only supportive care. These slowly progressive AML patients were characterized by a good performance status, and lower circulating blast cells and bone marrow blast counts.\n",
      "Chloramphenicol has been associated with the development of aplastic anaemia. As it is still widely used in Egypt, we studied its effect on 100 Egyptian toads (Bufo regularis) given a dose of chloramphenicol of 5 mg/40 g body weight for 12 weeks. We found it induced numerous, severe ultrastructural changes in almost all types of leukocytes. These changes were similar to those induced by the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene in 100 toads used as the carcinogen control group, and similar to those in leukocytes reported in humans with leukaemia. We recommend regulations be applied on the use of this antibiotic in countries where it is still widely used.\n",
      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a common, often incurable low-grade-B lymphoproliferative disorder. For many years, chlorambucil alone or with steroids has been the drug of choice in treatment-naive patients. Purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs) and, more recently, monoclonal antibodies (i.e. rituximab, alemtuzumab), have increased the potential for obtaining complete or even molecular remissions. Despite these advances, recurrent and/or relapsing disease remains a major concern. In this respect, new clinical and biological agents have recently been identified, which may allow a better selection for high-risk patients, who could be offered more aggressive therapies including haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although autologous transplant does not appear to provide additional benefit in advanced refractory disease, allogeneic transplant may offer a chance for cure. Non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant probably has curative potential with a better toxicity profile, and it is actively being investigated. We will review the role of the current therapeutic approach to CLL, focusing on the most recent advances in chemoimmunotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n",
      "This study revisited the Dohner prognostic hierarchy in a cohort of 1585 well-documented patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The duration of both time to first treatment (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) were significantly longer than observed previously, and this is at least partly due to improved therapeutic options. Deletion 13q remains the most favourable prognostic group with median TTFT and OS from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing of 72 months and >12 years, respectively. Deletion 11q had the poorest median TTFT (22 months) and 17p deletion the poorest median OS (5 years). The percentages of abnormal nuclei were significantly associated with differential TTFT for the trisomy 12, 13q and 17p deletion cohorts but not for the 11q deletion cohort. From the date of the first FISH study, patients with >85% 13q deletion nuclei had a notably shorter TTFT (24 months). Patients with ≤20% 17p deletion nuclei had longer median TTFT and OS from the date of the first FISH study (44 months and 11 years), and were more likely to be IGHV mutated.\n",
      "Autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation may carry an increased risk of secondary myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which are already recognized as complications of conventional treatment for lymphoid malignancies. In order to ascertain whether it is possible to detect the evolution of such a clone at an early stage in its development we have studied X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIPs) in three informative females who developed abnormal myelopoiesis after high-dose chemotherapy and ABMT. In one patient transplanted for relapsed Hodgkin disease a leukaemic clone comprising approximately 50% of the patient myeloid cells was detectable by comparison of peripheral blood granulocyte and T-cell XCIPs when the full blood count and morphology were normal. She presented with AML 7 months later. In two patients transplanted for AML, XCIP analysis was complicated by constitutively skewed Lyonization patterns, nevertheless a progressive alteration could be demonstrated by serial analyses. In one patient a difference was detectable 28 months before presentation with MDS. In the other patient, despite evident mild pancytopenia and alterations in her XCIPs over the past 4 years, she has developed no definitive myelodysplastic features and oligoclonality due to stem cell failure cannot be excluded. These studies show that XCIPs can be used to predict development of MDS/AML in some patients, but the technique is limited by technical variability and frequent constitutional skewing in the haemopoietic system.\n",
      "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) has become a well-established treatment option for many patients suffering from malignant and non-malignant diseases. In the past decade, high-resolution HLA-typing, remission surveillance, pre-emptive immune intervention, and standardisation in supportive care measures have substantially improved transplant outcomes. This retrospective study evaluated transplant procedures in 162 paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 124) or acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 38) who received their first alloHSCT in our institution over an 11-year period. We observed a significant reduction in risk of non-relapse mortality (NRM) over time (HR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.98; P = 0.05), the 4-year NRM estimate decreased from 20% in 2005-2008 to 7% in 2012-2016 (P = 0.02) and an increase in survival after relapse. There was no significant difference in patients who received a graft from a sibling, haplo, or an unrelated donor with regard to their overall survival (P = 0.45), event-free survival (P = 0.61), and non-relapse mortality (P = 0.19). Our data suggest that a specific transplant infrastructure with a highly experienced team in an accredited transplant centre likely contributes to better transplant outcomes for acute leukaemia patients in complete remission regardless of donor type.\n",
      "Bee venom is a very complex mixture produced and secreted by the honeybee (Apis mellifera). Melittin is a major component of bee venom that accounts for about 52% of its dry mass. A vast number of studies have been dedicated to the effects of melittin regulation of apoptosis and to the factors that induce apoptosis in various types of cancer such as breast, ovarian, prostate, lung. The latest evidence indicates its potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of leukaemia. The aim of our present study is to evaluate melittin ability to induce apoptosis in leukaemia cell lines of different origin acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (CCRF-CEM) and chronic myelogenous leukaemia (K-562). We demonstrated that melittin strongly reduced cell viability in both leukaemia cell lines but not in physiological peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs). Subsequent estimated parameters (mitochondrial membrane potential, Annexin V binding and Caspases 3/7 activity) clearly demonstrated that melittin induced apoptosis in leukaemia cells. This is a very important step for research into the development of new potential anti-leukaemia as well as anticancer therapies. Further analyses on the molecular level have been also planned (analysis of proapoptotic genes expression and DNA damages) for our next research project, which will also focus on melittin.\n",
      "Human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) and bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) infect T- and B-lymphocytes, respectively, provoking a polyclonal expansion that will evolve into an aggressive monoclonal leukaemia in ∼5% of individuals following a protracted latency period. It is generally assumed that early oncogenic changes are largely dependent on virus-encoded products, especially TAX and HBZ, while progression to acute leukaemia/lymphoma involves somatic mutations, yet that both are independent of proviral integration site that has been found to be very variable between tumours. Here, we show that HTLV-1/BLV proviruses are integrated near cancer drivers which they affect either by provirus-dependent transcription termination or as a result of viral antisense RNA-dependent cis-perturbation. The same pattern is observed at polyclonal non-malignant stages, indicating that provirus-dependent host gene perturbation contributes to the initial selection of the multiple clones characterizing the asymptomatic stage, requiring additional alterations in the clone that will evolve into full-blown leukaemia/lymphoma.\n",
      "Reliable epidemiological information on chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs), notably Philadelphia (Ph)/BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), is rare. Incidence rates vary from 0.6 to 2.0 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, increase with age and are higher in men than in women. Geographic and/or ethnic variations might contribute to the variability of incidences among registries. Prevalence rate has increased by use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In daily clinical practice, some CML management areas are not in line with the current recommendations. Problematic areas are sub-optimal timing of treatment decisions under monitoring, and unawareness of new molecular monitoring techniques and of beneficial new tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Median age differs between cancer registries and clinical trials by 10-20 years. Reports of clinical studies underestimate the true age of the CML population. Elderly CML patients are underrepresented in clinical studies and thus have a reduced access to investigational therapies.\n",
      "Patients with primary acute myeloid leukaemia were treated with induction therapy consisting of daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 (days 1 and 2) and continuous cytosine arabinoside 400 mg/m2 (days 1-5) with a 7-10-day gap between courses. Consolidation therapy consisted of one further similar course and a final course of cytosine 1 g/m2 infusion (days 1-5). Patients were randomised to receive no further treatment or monthly maintenance therapy consisting of thioguanine 100 mg/m2 twice daily and etoposide 100 mg/m2 twice daily (days 1-5) alternating with CCNU 50 mg/m2 once to a total of 6 courses. 64 patients entered the study; median age was 54 years (range 18-74 years) and 51 patients entered complete remission (79.7%). Thirty-two patients completed consolidation and were randomised between maintenance therapy (n = 16) and no treatment (n = 16). 21 patients have relapsed with neither remission duration nor relapse rate being affected by maintenance therapy.\n",
      "There is evidence to suggest a close relationship between the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. Using RT-PCR, we evaluated the coexpression of erythroid and megakaryocytic genes in blasts from 25 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases (FAB M1-M7) and three unclassifiable leukaemias with trilineage dysplasia (trilineal AML). All FAB M6 and M7 and trilineal leukaemias expressed mRNAs for alpha-globin, glycoprotein IIb (GpIIb), erythropoietin receptor (Epo-R) and thrombopoietin receptor (c-mpl), but not for myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in contrast was expressed in the other FAB-subtype leukaemias. These data support the hypothesis that blasts from M7 and M6 leukaemias may derive from (or represent) a common progenitor cell with resident bipotentiality towards the megakaryocytic and erythrocytic lineages.\n",
      "Following its success in multiple myeloma (MM), proteasome inhibition has become a topic of interest as novel treatment strategy of cancer. By simultaneously affecting multiple pathways in the cancer cell, such as deregulation of the programmed degradation of many cellular proteins, proteasome inhibition causes rapid apoptosis of these cells. Both in rapidly proliferating leukaemic cell lines and in primary leukaemic cells isolated from patients, proteasome inhibition results in antileukaemic activity. The normal counterparts of these cells are much more resistant to proteasome inhibitors (PI), thereby resulting in a favourable therapeutic index. Importantly, while leukaemic stem cells are sensitive to proteasome inhibition, normal haematopoietic stem cells are still viable after drug exposure. Nowadays, many PIs are being identified; bortezomib is the most well known since obtaining Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use in MM. This review summarises the biological and clinical aspects of proteasome inhibition and discusses the potential role of these inhibitors in the treatment of leukaemia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of karyotype in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) as a predictor of response to induction chemotherapy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at the department of Pathology and Oncology, Aga Khan University Karachi from January 2003 to January 2005. Newly diagnosed patients with denovo AML admitted to the hospital were included in the study. Diagnosis of AML was based on FAB criteria, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic studies. They were treated according to standard protocols (combination of anthracycline and cytarabine -3+7) and those who had acute promyelocytic leukaemia additionally received all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA). RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were enrolled, 4 were excluded due to inadequate cytogenetic analysis and the remaining patients entered the study protocol. There were 32 males and 20 females with mean age of 31.3 years (range 9 months to 73 years). Thirty-five (67.3%) patients had normal karyotype while 17 (32.7%) were found to have cytogenetic abnormalities. Eleven patients did not receive treatment at our hospital. Half of the (51.2%) patients out of remaining 41 achieved complete remission on bone marrow examination after receiving induction chemotherapy. In favourable risk group 3/3 (100%) achieved complete remission (CR) while 15/32 (46.9%) in intermediate risk group and 3/6 (50%) in unfavourable risk group. There was low CR rate in patients with high white cell counts. CONCLUSION: The frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in AML and response to induction chemotherapy was low when compared with international data possibly due to the small sample size. However, there was a clear difference in CR rates between favourable and unfavourable risk groups.\n",
      "We report the analysis of prognostic factors in a cohort of 660 patients entered in the first Medical Research Council trial in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) between 1978 and 1984. The majority (94%) of patients were aged 50 or over and the number of men (M) was almost twice that of women (F) with an M:F ratio of 1.8:1. The M:F ratio was lower, 1.5:1, in patients aged 70 or over. Stage A CLL was the most common, and stage C the least common, among women of all ages, in contrast to men for whom stage A only predominated in the older age group. As the majority of CLL patients are elderly we have examined the causes of death in great detail. 29% of deaths were unrelated to CLL, mainly other cancers (12%) and cardiovascular complications (16%). The majority of deaths in patients presenting with stages B and C were from CLL-related causes, whilst almost half of the deaths in patients presenting with stage A were not obviously related to CLL. Univariate analysis disclosed that the A, B, C staging system was the most important factor considered; stratified and multivariate analysis showed that age and response to treatment were the main prognostic factors after stage. Women always fared better than men and this was independent of stage and age. This and other features documented in the trial suggest a major biological difference between the sexes which has not been widely recognized. The significant influence of treatment response on patients' survival suggests that the search for better treatments in CLL may be rewarding. The improved median survival of stage C patients recorded in this trial, 41 months, compares favourably with previous reports and may have resulted from better treatment.\n",
      "This study attempted to validate central registration data on all childhood leukaemia cases in Scotland between 1968 and 1981 in line with the Black Enquiry concerning West Cumbria. Missing files precluded a complete verification, but minor errors of registration were found in 44% of cases. A small number of important mistakes of omission (eight cases), wrong diagnosis (six cases) and postal code errors (nine cases) were found which might affect epidemiological studies of these relatively rare diseases. Precise and verified prospective data collection at the time of diagnosis is essential if the spatial distribution of childhood cancers is being studied.\n",
      "The high relapse rate after T-cell depleted bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and the ability of donor lymphocyte transfusions to induce stable remission in patients relapsing after BMT has emphasized the importance of alloreacting donor T-lymphocytes in the graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect in this disease. The mechanisms underlying the GVL response and its relationship with graft-versus-host disease are becoming better defined. There is accumulating evidence that the CD4+ T-cell plays a central role in the GVL response. The prominent role of GVL in the cure of CML after BMT may be associated with the fact that CML cells are strongly immunogenic. New transplant strategies are being devised to separate GVL from graft-versus-host reactions. Future developments focus on the identification of leukaemia-specific antigens and the amplification of T-cell responses against them.\n",
      "Leukaemia cutis arises due to cutaneous infiltration of neoplastic leukocytes or their precursors. Recent evidence suggests that this sign does not necessarily herald a poor prognosis. We describe a 72-year-old woman with B-cell chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) who developed a papular eruption on her breast at the site of a recent herpetic eruption. Histology and immunostaining showed a dense dermal B-cell infiltrate in keeping with leukaemia cutis. The papules cleared in 6 months without treatment, leaving atrophic scars. The histological features and possible aetiological mechanisms of post-herpetic papular eruptions in CLL are reviewed.\n",
      "Concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) were determined by capillary column gas chromatography in samples of bone marrow from 38 children with leukaemia (16 samples/pools) and 15 control (5 pools). The highest mean and median concentrations were detected for total PCB (mean = 3.568 mg/kg fat basis/median 2.904 mg/kg) followed by the sum of the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane metabolites (1.775/1.059 mg/kg), hexachlorobenzene 0.354/0.260 mg/kg), the sum of the hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (0.133/0.093 mg/kg) and dieldrin (0.109/0.063 mg/kg). The CHC and PCB concentrations in bone marrow were two- to threefold higher than in fat tissue. Comparing children with and without leukaemia similar concentrations of CHC and PCB were found.\n",
      "Some relatively new issues that augment the usual practice of ignoring model uncertainty, when making inference about parameters of a specific model, are brought to the attention of the radiation protection community here. Nine recently published leukaemia risk models, developed with the Japanese A-bomb epidemiological mortality data, have been included in a model-averaging procedure so that the main conclusions do not depend on just one type of model or statistical test. The models have been centred here at various adult and young ages at exposure, for some short times since exposure, in order to obtain specially computed childhood Excess Relative Risks (ERR) with uncertainties that account for correlations in the fitted parameters associated with the ERR dose-response. The model-averaged ERR at 1 Sv was not found to be statistically significant for attained ages of 7 and 12 years but was statistically significant for attained ages of 17, 22 and 55 years. Consequently, such risks when applied to other situations, such as children in the vicinity of nuclear installations or in estimates of the proportion of childhood leukaemia incidence attributable to background radiation (i.e. low doses for young ages and short times since exposure), are only of very limited value, with uncertainty ranges that include zero risk. For example, assuming a total radiation dose to a 5-year-old child of 10 mSv and applying the model-averaged risk at 10 mSv for a 7-year-old exposed at 2 years of age would result in an ERR=0.33, 95% CI: -0.51 to 1.22. One model (United Nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation report. Volume 1. Annex A: epidemiological studies of radiation and cancer, United Nations, New York, 2006) weighted model-averaged risks of leukaemia most strongly by half of the total unity weighting and is recommended for application in future leukaemia risk assessments that continue to ignore model uncertainty. However, on the basis of the analysis presented here, it is generally recommended to take model uncertainty into account in future risk analyses.\n",
      "Cross-linkage of the CD95 (FAS/APO-1) antigen is responsible for the induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis in a variety of normal and malignant cells of the haemopoietic system. In order to evaluate predominant expression of the CD95 gene in a cell lineage-specific manner, we have determined the CD95 expression patterns in cell lines of myeloid, T-, pre-B- or B-cell origin as well as those established from Hodgkin disease (HD). Our results reveal constitutive transcriptional activation of the CD95 gene in all cell lines derived from the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Despite the ubiquitous expression of CD95 transcripts in haemopoietic cells, the corresponding protein was undetectable in 2/5 cell lines derived from Burkitt lymphomas and 6/16 leukaemia cell lines of the megakaryocytic or monocytic lineage. In an effort to identify apoptosis-resistant cell lines resulting from mutations in the death-signalling domain of CD9 5 or from defects in the apoptotic pathway or in survival programmes, we applied a CD95-mediated apoptosis assay. However, 21/38 CD95-expressing cell lines were sensitive upon induction with an anti-CD95 antibody whereas the remaining cell lines (predominantly of myeloid derivation) were resistant to antibody-induced cell death. Resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis was not due to mutations within the CD95 open reading frame as confirmed by a combined reverse transcription PCR sequencing method. Five myeloid out of 13 tumour lines with the apoptosis-resistance phenotype analysed showed programmed cell death, when protein synthesis was blocked by treatment with cycloheximide prior to CD95-mediated induction. These data suggest an active cellular mechanism for the maintenance of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. Elucidating the steps in such an active process of resistance to apoptosis might be expected to provide new approaches for therapeutic intervention in certain tumours.\n",
      "The treatment outcome of children with refractory acute leukaemia or relapse post-stem cell transplantation is dismal. We report 10 children (non-remission n = 7) who underwent a new haploidentical transplant approach utilizing unmanipulated bone marrow followed by CD6-depleted peripheral blood stem cells. Nine patients had successful engraftment and no evidence of leukaemia. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease was observed in five and three patients, respectively; two patients died of treatment-related toxicity. Seven patients relapsed after 7 (range 3-34) months, however two patients are alive at 6·5 and 7·0 years. This approach provides anti-leukaemic activity even in heavily pre-treated children but long-term disease control requires further intervention.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Inactivation of the FA-BRCA pathway results in chromosomal instability. Fanconi anaemia (FA) patients have an inherited defect in this pathway and are strongly predisposed to the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Studies in sporadic cancers have shown promoter methylation of the FANCF gene in a significant proportion of various solid tumours. However, only a single leukaemic case with methylation of one of the FA-BRCA genes has been described to date, i.e. methylation of FANCF in cell line CHRF-288. We investigated the presence of aberrant methylation in 11 FA-BRCA genes in sporadic cases of leukaemia. METHODS: We analyzed promoter methylation in 143 AML bone marrow samples and 97 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) samples using methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA). Samples with aberrant methylation were further analyzed by bisulphite sequencing and tested for mitomycin C sensitivity using Colony Forming Units assays. RESULTS: MS-MLPA showed promoter methylation of FANCC in one AML and three ALL samples, while FANCL was found methylated in one ALL sample. Bisulphite sequencing of promoter regions confirmed hypermethylation in all cases. In addition, samples with hypermethylation of either FANCC or FANCL appeared more sensitive towards mitomycin C in Colony Forming Units assays, compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of promoter regions from FA-BRCA genes does occur in sporadic leukaemia, albeit infrequently. Hypermethylation was found to result in hypersensitivity towards DNA cross-linking agents, a hallmark of the FA cellular phenotype, suggesting that these samples displayed chromosomal instability. This instability may have contributed to the occurrence of the leukaemia. In addition, this is the first report to describe hypermethylation of FANCC and FANCL. This warrants the investigation of multiple FA-BRCA genes in other malignancies.\n",
      "In children with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), myeloid sarcomas (MS) of the central nervous system (CNS) are rare. Since MS involving the CNS are potentially curable, timely recognition is paramount. Establishing a diagnosis may be problematic as they can easily mimic primary CNS neoplasms. We report the case of a 5-year-old boy with AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22) rearrangement who presented with a massive intracranial MS and rapid clinical deterioration suggestive of a meningioma or a primitive neuroectodermal tumour. The peripheral smear showed blasts with Auer rods. Urgent chemotherapy was started for AML with presumptive CNS MS. The mass resolved with chemotherapy, and treatment was consolidated with radiotherapy. Although exceedingly rare, this case highlights the potential for MS to present similarly to a primary CNS tumour. MS should be part of the differential diagnosis as part of a CNS mass, particularly if the complete blood count is abnormal.\n",
      "Two continuously growing cell lines, designated YOS-M and YOS-B, were established simultaneously from a patient with Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in myeloid blast crisis. Both YOS-M and YOS-B had the Ph1 chromosome and identical additional chromosome abnormalities, which were not detected in the chronic phase. Cytochemical analysis showed that YOS-M was significantly positive for peroxidase, whereas YOS-B was entirely negative. YOS-M expressed myeloid-associated antigens (CD14, CD33) as well as CD4, CD25 and CD34. The surface phenotype of YOS-M was identical to that of the leukaemic blasts found in the patient. On the other hand, YOS-B expressed mature B-cell markers, CD19, CD20, CD21 and surface immunoglobulin, but not myeloid-associated antigens. These two cell lines showed an identical rearrangement pattern of the break point cluster region on chromosome 22, but rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was detected only in YOS-B. These findings provide definite evidence that CML cells still have the capability to differentiate and mature along different haematopoietic cell lineages even after blast crisis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Aetiology of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is not well understood, perhaps because of its distinct subtypes. High-dose ionising radiation is a known risk factor, but less is known about risk from low-dose exposure such as from diagnostic radiography. METHODS: Subjects were 412 matched case-control pairs. Ten-year subject histories of diagnostic radiography were based on interview and medical records. RESULTS: There was no convincing association between AML risk and ionising radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging procedures, either for AML overall or for any AML subtype. CONCLUSION: The association between diagnostic radiography and AML risk remains uncertain.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: Oncogenic activation of the PI3K signalling pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). A central node in PI3K downstream signalling is controlled by the serine-threonine kinase AKT1. A somatic mutation affecting residue E17 of the AKT1 gene has recently been identified in breast and colon cancer. The E17K change results in constitutive AKT1 activation, induces leukaemia in mice, and accordingly, may be therapeutically exploited to target the PI3K pathway. Assessing whether AKT1 is activated by somatic mutations in GBM is relevant to establish its role in this aggressive disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a systematic mutational analysis of the complete coding sequence of the AKT1 gene in a panel of 109 tumor GBM samples and nine high grade astrocytoma cell lines. However, no somatic mutations were detected in the coding region of AKT1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that in GBM oncogenic deregulation of the PI3K pathway does not involve somatic mutations in the coding region of AKT1.\n",
      "The most common secondary neoplasms which occur following cranial radiation therapy are sarcoma and meningioma. The occurrence of glioblastoma multiforme following radiation and chemotherapy in acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) is rare. We report 3 cases of glioblastoma multiforme in children developing 11-72 months following completion of chemotherapy/radiotherapy for ALL. The exact cause for the development of glioblastoma multiforme following therapy for ALL is not clear. A genetic predisposition may be essential for the occurrence of such a highly malignant primary brain tumour in leukaemia patients, irrespective of radiation and/or chemotherapy. The pathogenesis and surgical management are discussed, and the literature on the subject is reviewed.\n"
